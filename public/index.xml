      <description>Engineer and doctor in industrial engineering, my professional and research experiences are mainly focused on the digital tools of the different steps of the innovation and creativity process. I address the issues of preparation of the ideation phase, capitalization of knowledge from ideation to prototyping, visualization and prototyping of concepts.
I am interested in artificial intelligence technologies (ontology, machine learning, neural networks, optimization &amp;hellip;). I did my thesis in collaboration with Polytechnique Montréal on knowledge management during the collaborative process of creativity.</description>

      <description>Engineer and PhD. I am a researcher that is passionate about human-centered design methods, innovation, technology and coffee (yes coffee!).
I have been interested in stakeholder&amp;rsquo;s and user&amp;rsquo;s integration during the entire design cycle as a way to improve a product&amp;rsquo;s acceptability. Uncovering the need for tools to help designers and engineers to evaluate and measure the product&amp;rsquo;s acceptability, I developed a method to estimate it early in the design process.</description>
