## Ethical Issues

.pull-left-2[
- **Purposely misrepresenting** the work of other authors ‚Äì their viewpoints, ideas, models, findings, conclusions, interpretations, and so on. 

- **Plagiarism** ‚Äì the use of another‚Äôs original words, arguments, or ideas as though they were your own, even if this is done in good faith, out of carelessness, or out of ignorance.

Both **purposely misrepresenting the work of others** and **plagiarism** are considered to be fraud.

## Plagiarism


- Using the work of others as if it were your own does not convey much respect for the efforts that other people have put into their work.

- Makes it is difficult for the reader to verify whether your claims about other authors and sources are accurate

- You are participating in a scientific debate.
