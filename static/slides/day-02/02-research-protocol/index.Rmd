## Learning objectives

1. Have a mental model to understand research development.
2. Clearly identify the concept of research protocol

## Everything start with a good research question

- Descriptive:

‘What’, ‘When’, ‘Where’, ‘Who’ or ‘How’

- Explanatory ('Why'?)

.tiny[(e.g. ‘Why did 65% of coachees report that coaching helped them with a problem they experienced?’)]

# Some Examples methodologies

---

## Research design: Case studies

.pull-left[

- Collecting information of a specific object, event or activity, such as a particular business unit or organization.

- To obtain a clear picture of a problem one must examine the real‐life situation from various angles and perspectives using multiple methods of data collection. 

- Useful for studying different organizations (historical records, interviews etc). 

]

---

## Research design: Ethnography 

.pull-left-2[
 - The researcher *"closely observes, records, and engages in the daily life of another culture [...] and then writes accounts of this culture, emphasizing descriptive detail"*.
 
-  Immersion in the particular culture of the social group. Observing behavior [listening, asking questions]. 
   
- Aims to generate an understanding of the culture and behavior of a social group from an "insider’s point of view". 

> e.g. Ethnography of virtual communities, understanding why people behave a certain way
]

---

## Research design: Action research

- Research strategy aimed at effecting planned changes. 
- A tentative problem solution is implemented, with the knowledge that there may be unintended consequences. 
- The effects are then evaluated, defined, and diagnosed, and the research continues on an ongoing basis until the problem is fully resolved. 

> Linked to change management, interesting when for modifying a practice in action (teachers)

## Research design: Experiments

- To study causal relationships between variables. A->B

> e.g: A “reward system”, to establish whether (and to what extent) this change will produce a change in “productivity”. Employees might be assigned to two groups after a certain time we are able to determine whether the productivity of the two groups is different after the treatment.
