J	Huang, HH; Liu, WH; Liu, ZF				Huang, Haihong; Liu, Weihao; Liu, Zhifeng			An additive manufacturing-based approach for carbon fiber reinforced polymer recycling	CIRP ANNALS-MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Recycling; Composite; Additive manufacturing		The vast Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) waste accumulated is pressing for its recycling. A novel recycling approach, which integrated carbon fiber reclamation and composite additive manufacturing, is proposed to process the CFRP waste into three Dimensional (3D) parts. In the experiments, the CFRP waste was recycled by supercritical n-butanol to yield reclaimed Carbon Fibers (rCFs). The rCFs were ground by a ball mill, mixed with Poly-Ether-Ether-Ketone (PEEK) powder and then extruded to the composite filament. The filament was fed to the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printer to fabricate 3D parts. Mechanical and electrical properties of the parts were investigated and compared with that of pure PEEK. The results illustrate that the additive manufacturing-based approach offers a potential strategy to reuse the CFRP waste and rapidly fabricate the rCF reinforced plastics with complex geometry and function.

This work presents a novel additive manufacturing-based recycling approach that can be used to reclaim CFRP waste and to re-manufacture the carbon fiber into 3D printed composite parts. A trial of this idea was set up, in which carbon fiber was first reclaimed from CFRP waste using supercritical fluid and then mixed with Poly-Ether-Ether-Ketone to produce composite filaments. The filaments were then fed into a printer of fused deposition modeling (i.e., a 3D printing process) and the recycled CFRP parts were fabricated. The engineering application-oriented tests demonstrate that the reclaimed carbon fiber can modify the performances of 3D printed part effectively in terms of mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, heat conduction and wear resistance. This work illustrates that the additive manufacturing-based recycling approach offers a possible strategy to recycle CFRP waste and fabricate high-performance engineering parts with complex geometries, which are economical and environmentally friendly.

Tests were carried out initially using virgin ABS, which subsequently underwent two successive closed-loop filament extrusion and 3D printing phases. For each endpoint manufacturing phase, samples were examined to monitor the changes in thermal characteristics, mechanical properties, and polymer degradation. It was found that there was a series of physical changes of the polymer, which resulted in reduced melt flow, increased glass transition temperature, and the generation of carbonyl groups, which may be attributed to the thermal oxidative breakdown of both styrene acrylonitrile (SAN) and butadiene components of ABS. The recycled polymer also showed a reduction in both tensile and compressive strengths compared to the virgin material. However, compared to one-time recycled ABS, two-times recycled ABS showed increased strength, implying that increased recycle state of the polymer may be advantageous with respect to mechanical properties and potential manufacturing applications. This study ultimately demonstrates the potential to leverage additive manufacturing (AM) toward a closed-loop manufacturing paradigm by using waste ABS across several life cycles.

Recycling of such materials is mostly a thermomechanical process that modifies their overall mechanical behavior. The present research work focuses on the recyclability of high-density polyethylene (HDPE), one of the most recycled materials globally, for use in additive manufacturing (AM). A thorough investigation was carried out to determine the effect of the continuous recycling on mechanical, structural, and thermal responses of HDPE polymer via a process that isolates the thermomechanical treatment from other parameters such as aging, contamination, etc. Fused filament fabrication (FFF) specimens were produced from virgin and recycled materials and were experimentally tested and evaluated in tension, flexion, impact, and micro-hardness. A thorough thermal and morphological analysis was also performed. The overall results of this study show that the mechanical properties of the recycled HDPE polymer were generally improved over the recycling repetitions for a certain number of recycling steps, making the HDPE recycling a viable option for circular use. Repetitions two to five had the optimum overall mechanical behavior, indicating a significant positive impact of the HDPE polymer recycling aside from the environmental one.

Recycling of such materials is mostly a thermomechanical process that modifies their overall mechanical behavior. The present research work focuses on the acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) polymer, which is the second most popular material used in FFF-3D printing. In order to investigate the effect of the recycling courses on the mechanical response of the ABS polymer, an experimental simulation of the recycling process that isolates the thermomechanical treatment from other parameters (i.e., contamination, ageing, etc.) has been performed. To quantify the effect of repeated recycling processes on the mechanic response of the ABS polymer, a wide variety of mechanical tests were conducted on FFF-printed specimens. Regarding this, standard tensile, compression, flexion, impact and micro-hardness tests were performed per recycle repetition. The findings prove that the mechanical response of the recycled ABS polymer is generally improved over the recycling repetitions for a certain number of repetitions. An optimum overall mechanical behavior is found between the third and the fifth repetition, indicating a significant positive impact of the ABS polymer recycling, besides the environmental one.

These great characteristics are accompanied by some recycling difficulties of the final products, particularly originated from the tire waste rubber industry. In this study, recycled tire rubber was incorporated in polymer matrices using selective laser sintering as 3D printing technology. Two polymers were used-polyamide and thermoplastic polyurethane, for their rigid and elastomeric properties, respectively. Polymer composites containing various tire powder amounts, up to 40 wt.%, were prepared by physical blending. The final materials' morphological characteristics, mechanical properties, and thermal stability were evaluated. The proposed ambitious additive manufacturing approach looked over also some of the major aspects to be considered during the 3D printing procedure. In addition, examples of printed prototypes with potential applications were also proposed revealing the potential of the recycled tire rubber-loaded composites.

An emerging idea is to incorporate composite recyclate in additive manufacturing. The focus of this work was to develop this capability and research the functional performance of additive manufactured parts through incorporating recyclate fibre in fused deposition modeling material. The research focused on additive manufacturing with virgin acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and recyclate fibre reinforced ABS. The effect on tensile strength for different fibres (recycled by pyrolysis and mechanical process) was evaluated. Tensile test result showed an improvement by 43%, 49% and 69% when ABS was reinforced with mechanically recycled fibre, Pyrolysis recycled fibre and virgin carbon fibre respectively. The work identified the key potential for additive manufacturing to utilize recyclate and functional benefits as well as the areas for further scientific research. This is important for new innovations for use of composite recyclate to improve the functionality of additively manufactured parts. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Cruz; Boudaoud, Hakim; Hoppe, Sandrine; Camargo, Mauricio			Polymer recycling in an open-source additive manufacturing context: Mechanical issues	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						3D printing; Plastic recycling; Mechanical properties; PLA; Open source additive manufacturing; RepRap		Nowadays, the low recycling rate of polymers is still a challenge to humankind due to energy, economic and logistical issues. In the context of additive manufacturing, there is an exponential use of thermoplastic materials in the industrial and public open-source additive manufacturing sector, leading to an increase in global polymer consumption and waste generation. However, the coupling of the open-source 3D printers with polymer processing could potentially offer the basis for a new paradigm of distributed recycling process. It could be a complementary alternative to the traditional paradigm of centralized recycling of polymers, which is often uneconomical and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. In order to achieve this goal, a first step is to prove the technical feasibility to recycle thermoplastic material intended for open-source 3D printing feedstock. The contribution of the present study is twofold: first, a general methodology to evaluate the recyclability of thermoplastics used as feedstock in open-source 3D printing machines is proposed. Then, the proposed methodology is applied to the recycling study of polylactic acid (PLA) material addressed to the fused filament fabrication (FFF) technique, which is currently the most widely used. The main results of this application contribute to the understanding of the influence of the material's physico-chemical degradation on its mechanical properties as well as its potential distributed recyclability.

Technical pathways for distributed recycling of polymer composites for distributed manufacturing: Windshield wiper blades	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Polymer composite; Recycling; Additive manufacturing; Distributed recycling; Distributed manufacturing; 3D printing	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; PROCESS PARAMETERS; EXTRUSION SYSTEM; WASTE POLYMER; REPRAP; FILAMENT; POLYETHYLENE; FABRICATION; LOOP	Centralized waste plastic recycling is economically challenging, yet distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM) provides consumers with direct economic incentives to recycle. This study explores the technical pathways for DRAM of complex polymer composites using a case study of windshield wiper blades. These blades are a thermoplastic composite made up of a soft (flexible) and hard (less flexible) material. The distributed manufacturing methods included mechanical grinding to fused granular fabrication, heated syringe printing, 3-D printed molds coupled to injection molding and filament production in a recyclebot to fused filament fabrication. The particle size, angle of repose, thermal and rheological properties are characterized for the two sub-materials to define the conditions for the extrusion. A successful pathway for fabricating new products was found and the mechanical properties of the resultant components were quantified. Finally, the means to convert scrap windshield wiper blades into useful, high-value, bespoke biomedical products of fingertip grips for hand prosthetics was demonstrated. This study showed that the DRAM model of materials recycling can be used to improve the variety of solutions for a circular economy.

Thermoplastic wastes can be recycled in many cases. Recently these recycled plastics have been used to manufacture the input filament necessary for material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEAM). Polylactic acid (PLA) is one of the most common and potentially useful engineering plastics that can be additively manufactured, but the effect of recycling on the effective properties is still not well known. In this study, the mechanical properties of MEAM-processed PLA were compared for virgin and recycled feedstock. The collected data were analyzed using a full-factorial design of experiments method, providing insight into the effects of layer thickness and infill density on the performance of the material before and after recycling. The results showed a notable degradation in properties after recycling, but this effect was moderated by modifying the studied parameters. This work and its conclusions will serve as a screening study to guide future efforts in this area and promote the wider use of recycled materials in additive manufacturing.

Polylactic acid (PLA), a thermoplastic biobased and biodegradable polymer, is used as matrix for the composite filament, as it is the most common plastic used in FDM due to its good mechanical properties, stiffness, and strength. Upon production process optimization, filaments with rCF loadings of 5 and 10% wt are produced and analyzed. A particular attention is devoted to the evaluation of the production process on the carbon fibers (CFs) length and the study of the thermal and mechanical properties of the obtained composite materials.

Sustainable additive manufacturing: predicting binder jettability ofwater-soluble, biodegradable and recyclable polymers	POLYMER INTERNATIONAL			English	Review						additive manufacturing; binder jetting; sustainable manufacturing; polymers; recycling; circular economy	DRUG-DELIVERY; CERAMIC SUSPENSIONS; MOLECULAR-WEIGHT; FIBER FORMATION; 3D; FABRICATION; BEHAVIOR; SIMULATION; GEOMETRIES; VISCOSITY	Additive manufacturing potentially generates customized polymeric objects with tailored geometry while reducing waste, employing biodegradable polymers and striving to use recyclable polymer feedstocks for a more sustainable future. Binder jetting additive manufacturing (BJ AM) creates 3D objects upon depositing liquid adhesive onto a powder bed, while a roller spreads powder over a build stage to form subsequent layers. Many factors affect jettability and printability including printhead design, binder material, binder solvent and powder characteristics. Material design for higher strength BJ AM parts using metals, ceramics or polymers exploits binders or particles that transform into thermosets or permanently shaped matrices through thermal or UV curing and sintering. While many BJ AM examples utilize biodegradable, water-soluble and recyclable polymers for biomedical and industrial applications, a wider array of opportunities exist to degrade, dissolve and reuse printed materials. Systematically shifting to these polymers will facilitate reuse and recycling of both binders and powders, but more studies to improve part strength are required. This review describes an overview of polymer jettability and a perspective into opportunities currently underutilized in transitioning BJ AM into a more sustainable AM platform.

This results in the generation of thousands of tons of residual polymeric packaging waste, which is either left behind in the environment or otherwise recycled or incinerated at a cost of several millions of U.S. dollars per year. Advancements in distributed recycling technologies now allow for on-demand reconstitution of traditionally neglected MRE pouch waste into useful appliances via material extrusion additive manufacturing. In this work, we demonstrate recycling of MRE pouch materials through a combined compounding, filament extrusion, and fused filament fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing protocol. Mechanical properties and barrier properties of additively manufactured structures were evaluated through tensile testing and water vapor transmission testing, respectively, and found to be comparable to the native pouch materials. Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Thermogravimetric Analysis of the extruded filament and printed materials were contrasted with native pouch materials, showing minimal effects of the manufacturing process on critical thermal transitions in the polymer. Economics and viability of on-demand reconstitution using these proposed methods are briefly discussed and reveal the multiple benefits of this recycling process.

It is one of the flexible manufacturing technique that can apply to polymers, metals, ceramics, concrete, and composites. Owing to the ability to select from a wide range of processible polymers and the enhancement in some of the properties offered by polymers, the AM industry, still predominantly targets the production of polymeric components. This review demonstrates the current state of AM industry regarding polymeric materials. A brief explanation of the additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, polymers, and polymer composites (fibre reinforces, particle reinforced and nanocomposites) utilised in the AM processes is provided. Polymer AM is being applied in different applications such as biomedical, electronics, aerospace, automobile, and sporting industries respectively. The review also emphasizes the rising importance of antimicrobial polymers in the COVID-19 pandemic. The exponential use of polymeric materials in the industrial sector has caused an increase in wastage generation and disposal issues which draws attention to the importance of green composites as well as life cycle assessment (LCA) of products and processes. Finally, the significance of Distributed Recycling via AM due to the disposal issues and low polymer recycling rates is illustrated. ? 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In comparison to other additive manufacturing processes, fused filament fabrication (FFF) has more adaptability for the use of fibre reinforcement due to its controlled, meticulous orientation and good dispersal capabilities for additively manufactured products. Many researchers have made numerous efforts to enhance the application domain using composite materials in FFF. The inclusion of fibres in the polymers is attractive in increasing the strength of products. In addition, recent studies have defined the relationship between sustainability and additive manufacturing by incorporating natural fibres and recycled matrix materials in AM. This review article summarises various possibilities of fibre reinforced additive manufacturing, specifically in FFF of thermoplastic composites that enhance the mechanical properties. Finally, the critical research questions for the future advancement of sustainable additive manufacturing, particularly in fibre reinforced FFF, are posed.

For comparison purposes, the mechanical properties of the same virgin and recycled materials were investigated also with injection-molded specimens. The fracture behavior was investigated by analyzing the damage at a macroscopic as well as microscopic level. As the main outcome, it was noted that both the manufacturing and recycling processes play a crucial role in the damage mechanics of the specimens, thus explaining the different fracture behaviors noted at the macroscale.

Additive manufacturing technology has been emerging as a solution, enhancing circular economy models, and using recycled composites for glass fiber-reinforced polymers is spreading as a new additive manufacturing trend. Nevertheless, their mechanical properties are still not comparable to pristine materials. The purpose of this paper is to examine the additive re-manufacturing of end-of-life glass fiber composites with mechanical performances that are comparable to virgin glass fiber-reinforced materials. Through a systematic characterization of the recyclate, requirements of the filler for the liquid deposition modeling process were identified. Printability and material surface quality of different formulations were analyzed using a low-cost modified 3D printer. Two hypothetical design concepts were also manufactured to validate the field of application. Furthermore, an understanding of the mechanical behavior was accomplished by means of tensile tests, and the results were compared with a benchmark formulation with virgin glass fibers. Mechanically recycled glass fibers show the capability to substitute pristine fillers, unlocking their use for new fields of application.

Plastic recycling in additive manufacturing: A systematic literature review and opportunities for the circular economy	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Review						Distributed recycling; Plastic recycling; Additive manufacturing; 3D printing; Circular economy	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; OF-THE-ART; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; DIMENSIONAL ACCURACY; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; EXTRUSION SYSTEM; VALUE CREATION; WASTE POLYMER; LARGE-SCALE; 3D PRINTER	The rapid technical evolution of additive manufacturing (AM) enables a new path to a circular economy using distributed recycling and production. This concept of Distributed Recycling via Additive Manufacturing (DRAM) is related to the use of recycled materials by means of mechanical recycling process in the 3D printing process chain. This paper aims to examine the current advances on thermoplastic recycling processes via additive manufacturing technologies. After proposing a closed recycling global chain for DRAM, a systematic literature review including 92 papers from 2009 to 2019 was performed using the scopus, web of science and springer databases. This work examines main topics from six stages (recovery, preparation, compounding, feedstock, printing, quality) of the proposed DRAM chain. The results suggested that few works have been done for the recovery and preparation stages, while a great progress has already been done for the other stages in order to validate the technical feasibility, environmental impact, and economic viability. Potential research paths in the pre-treatment of recycled material at local level and printing chain phases were identified in order to connect the development of DRAM with the circular economy ambition at micro, meso and macro level. The development of each stage proposed using the open source approach is a relevant path to scale DRAM to reach the full technical potential as a centerpiece of the circular economy.

Rubber toughened recycled polyethylene terephthalate for material extrusion additive manufacturing	POLYMER INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						recycled polyethylene terephthalate; 3D printing; rubber toughened; material extrusion additive manufacturing; SEBS	POLY(ETHYLENE-TEREPHTHALATE) BLENDS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; SEMICRYSTALLINE PET; MORPHOLOGY; TOUGHNESS; POLYMERS; BEHAVIOR; MATRIX	Plastic packaging materials represent a new class of low-cost and sustainable additive manufacturing feedstocks. Recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has been shown to be a robust material for material extrusion additive manufacturing, with mechanical properties comparable with acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene. However, due to PET's high crystallinity, it is generally a brittle material and can be subject to premature fracture. It is well known that the addition of rubbers can serve to toughen PET. In this work, micronized rubber powder, as well as non-reactive and functionalized styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene (SEBS) elastomers were compounded with recycled PET. Tensile strength was not significantly affected, but toughness increased 85% with the addition of 5 wt% rubber, 350% with SEBS and over 550% with maleic anhydride functionalized SEBS compared to neat recycled PET. Fracture surface analysis revealed evidence of ductile fracture and cavitation in the rubber toughened samples. Published 2020.

AM enables the fabrication of innumerable 3D geometries that cannot be easily produced by other means. In spite of the great promise of AM as an advanced form of future manufacturing, there are still fundamental challenges with respect to sustainability that need to be addressed. Some of the material needs for AM include sustainable sources of printing inks, resins, and filaments, as well as pathways for polymer recycling, upcycling, and chemical circularity. Furthermore, the combination of biosourced and biodegradable polymers with additive manufacturing could enable the fabrication of objects that can be recycled back into feedstock or degraded into nontoxic products after they have served their function. Herein, we review the recent literature on the design and chemistry of the polymers that enable sustainability within the field of AM, with a particular focus on biodegradable and biosourced polymers. We also discuss some of the sustainability-related applications that have emerged as a result of AM technologies.

Recycling of such materials is mostly based on thermomechanical processes that significantly affect the mechanical, as well as the overall physicochemical properties of polymers. The study at hand focuses on the recyclability of Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) 3D printed Polypropylene (PP) for a certain number of recycling courses (six in total), and its effect on the mechanical properties of 3D printed parts. Namely, 3D printed specimens were fabricated from non-recycled and recycled PP material, and further experimentally tested regarding their mechanical properties in tension, flexion, impact, and microhardness. Comprehensive dynamic scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Raman spectroscopy, and morphological investigations by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed for the different 3D printed PP samples. The overall results showed that there is an overall slight increase in the material's mechanical properties, both in tension and in flexion mode, while the DSC characterization indicates an increase in the polymer crystallinity over the recycling course.

This study extends this potential to high-performance (high-mechanical-strength and heat-resistant) polymers using polycarbonate (PC). Recycled PC regrind of approximately 25 mm(2) was 3D printed with an open-source Gigabot X and analyzed. A temperature and nozzle velocity matrix was used to find useful printing parameters, and a print test was used to maximize the output for a two-temperature stage extruder for PC. ASTM type 4 tensile test geometries as well as ASTM-approved compression tests were used to determine the mechanical properties of PC and were compared with filament printing and the bulk virgin material. The results showed the tensile strength of parts manufactured from the recycled PC particles (64.9 MPa) were comparable to that of the commercial filament printed on desktop (62.2 MPa) and large-format (66.3 MPa) 3D printers. Three case study applications were investigated: (i) using PC as a rapid molding technology for lower melting point thermoplastics, (ii) printed parts for high temperature applications, and (iii) printed parts for high-strength applications. The results show that recycled PC particle-based 3D printing can produce high-strength and heat-resistant products at low costs.

Recycled Cellulose Polypropylene Composite Feedstocks for Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing	ACS OMEGA			English	Article							STATE SHEAR PULVERIZATION; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; COUPLING AGENTS; MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE; THERMAL-EXPANSION; FILLER CONTENT; FIBER; POLYETHYLENE; POLYMER; BEHAVIOR	Many types of consumer-grade packaging can be used in material extrusion additive manufacturing processes, providing a high-value output for waste plastics. However, many of these plastics have reduced mechanical properties and increased warpage/shrinkage compared to those commonly used in three-dimensional (3D) printing. The addition of reinforcing materials can lead to stiffer parts with reduced distortion. This paper presents work in the reinforcement of recycled polypropylene using cellulose waste materials to generate a green composite feedstock for extrusion-based polymer additive manufacturing. Recycled polypropylene/waste paper, cardboard, and wood flour composites were made using a solid-state shear pulverization process. Fourier transform infrared and thermogravimetric analysis were utilized to qualitatively analyze the amount of filler incorporated into the 3D-printed materials. Recycled polymer composites had increased levels of filler incorporated in the printed parts compared to the virgin polymer composites based on the thermal gravimetric analysis. The dynamic mechanical analysis showed a ca. 20-30% increase in storage modulus with the addition of cellulose materials. Tensile strength was not significantly increased with the addition of 10 wt % cellulose, but the elastic modulus increased 38% in virgin polypropylene. The analysis of fracture surfaces revealed that failure initiates at the interface, suggesting that the interfacial strength is weaker than the filler strength.

But nowadays, just a small portion of plastic waste is recycled. Plastic pyrolysis and polymer breakdown are environmentally hazardous. Processing is, therefore, necessary for recycling. Plastics are constantly being manufactured and require minimal processing, necessitating innovation. Plastic recycling is becoming a major issue for environmentalists and waste management professionals. Fused deposition modelling, or FDM, is one of the most popular types of additive manufacturing. It uses the melt extrusion process to deposit filaments of thermal polymers in a predetermined pattern. Using a computer-generated design, 3D printing, sometimes referred to as additive manufacturing, is a technique for building three-dimensional objects layer by layer. A 3D item is produced by the additive method of 3D printing, which involves building up layers of material. To make a three-dimensional object, FDM printers eject a thermoplastic filament that has been heated to its melting point layer by layer. 3D printing is a rapidly expanding industry and the market in this field has grown up to 23% by 2021. Several experiments on new 3D printing materials have been carried out to reduce pollution and the supply of plastic. Various additives have been investigated to increase recycled polymers' molecular weight and mechanical properties. The most frequent type of fibre found in that is thermoplastic fibre. In this instance, waste ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) plastic from industrial FDM printers was gathered and examined in a bustling open shop. In this review, we discussed the use of recyclable polymers in 3D printing for waste material management.

Processing techniques of polymeric materials and their reinforced composites	ADVANCES IN MATERIALS AND PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Review						Primary recycling; secondary recycling; tertiary recycling; quaternary recycling; additive manufacturing	PLASTIC SOLID-WASTE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; 3D; PARTS; INCINERATION; MANAGEMENT; PYROLYSIS	This paper reports the state of art review for processing techniques used in recycling of thermoplastics polymers with different types of reinforcements, especially for additive manufacturing (AM) applications. In last two decades, some studies have reported use of primary (1 degrees), secondary (2 degrees), tertiary (3 degrees) and quaternary (4 degrees) ways to process polymeric materials from recycling view point. But hither to little has been reported on standardisation of 1 degrees /2 degrees /3 degrees /4 degrees routes in AM applications. The present study bridges the gaps for use of 1 degrees /2 degrees /3 degrees /4 degrees routes as an industrial processing standard with low cost AM technology (which have been presented as four case studies for field engineers).

Glycol-modified polyethylene terephthalate (PETG) is known to have some enhanced properties as compared to polyethylene terephthalate (PET) homopolymer; this has recently attracted the interest from the fused filament fabrication (FFF) three-dimensional (3D) printing community. PET has shown a reduced ability for repeated recycling through traditional processes. Herein, we demonstrate the potential for using recycled PETG in consecutive 3D printing manufacturing processes. Distributed recycling additive manufacturing (DRAM)-oriented equipment was chosen in order to test the mechanical and thermal response of PETG material in continuous recycling processes. Tensile, flexure, impact strength, and Vickers micro-hardness tests were carried out for six (6) cycles of recycling. Finally, Raman spectroscopy as well as thermal and morphological analyses via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) fractography were carried out. In general, the results revealed a minor knockdown effect on the mechanical properties as well as the thermal properties of PETG following the process proposed herein, even after six rounds of recycling.

These systems selectively extrude/deposit polymers to manufacture parts directly from computational designs. Therefore, FDM enables conversion of recycled thermoplastic polymers to higher quality products. However, FDM induces porosity, which reduces mechanical performance and causes variations in mechanical properties of fused deposition modeled (FDMed) polymers. A safe and reliable use of FDMed-recycled polymers demands a better understanding of the effect of recycling on the mechanical properties. In this study, we investigated the effect of three rounds of recycling on the stochastic mechanical properties of FDMed ABS. A total of 337 tensile tests were performed on FDMed virgin and recycled ABS. Recycling increased the porosity of FDMed ABS from similar to 11 vol% to similar to 17 vol %. The tensile and fracture strength decreased by similar to 10%. The strain at break decreased by 25% from 5.2% to 3.9%, causing a decrease in toughness by 37%. We observed significant variations in the mechanical properties, which were analyzed using Weibull statistics. An S-type deviation from Weibull distribution was observed for strength variations that was related to porosity. Minimal degradation in ABS molecular structure was observed via gel permeation chromatography, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy revealed an increase in elemental iron with recycling. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Rimkus, A; Farh, MM; Gribniak, V				Rimkus, Arvydas; Farh, Mahmoud M.; Gribniak, Viktor			Continuously Reinforced Polymeric Composite for Additive Manufacturing-Development and Efficiency Analysis	POLYMERS			English	Article						additive manufacturing; polylactic acid; aramid fibers; continuous reinforcement; recycling; tensile tests	CARBON-FIBER; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; EXTRUSION; FABRICATION; PREDICTION; VIRGIN; GLASS	Additive manufacturing (AM) is a rapidly growing technology, referring to a 3D design process by which digital data builds a physical object in layers by depositing the printed material. The AM has evolved in the aviation, automotive, and medical industries. The AM development for fiber-reinforced composites is the point of current interest, with most research focused on using short fibers. However, notwithstanding particular technological complexities, continuous filaments have superior tensile properties compared to short fibers. Therefore, this manuscript develops an adaptive continuous reinforcement approach for AM based on polymeric material extrusion (ME) technology. It combines the raw material production process, including the ability to vary constituents (e.g., filament materials, reinforcement percentage, and recycled plastic replacement ratio), and the reinforcement efficiency analysis regarding the experimentally verified numerical model. The literature review has identified compatible materials for ensuring sustainable and high-performance plastic composites reinforced with continuous fibers. In addition, it identified the applicability of recycled polymers in developing ME processes. Thus, the study includes an experimental program to investigate the mechanical performance of 3D printed samples (polylactic acid, PLA, matrix reinforced with continuous aramid filament) through a tensile test. Recycled polymer replaced 40% of the virgin PLA. The test results do not demonstrate the recycled polymer's negative effect on the mechanical performance of the printed samples. Moreover, the recycled material reduced the PLA cost by almost twice. However, together with the potential efficiency of the developed adaptive manufacturing technology, the mechanical characteristics of the printed material revealed room for printing technology improvement, including the aligned reinforcement distribution in the printed product and printing parameters' setup.

Owing to the continuous diffusion of 3D printing driven by low-cost entry-level material extrusion printers, sustainability of a so popular AM technology is of paramount importance. Therefore, recycling 3D printed wastes and 3D parts again at the end of their life is an important issue to be addressed. Research efforts are directed towards the improvement of the biodegradability of 3D printing filaments and the replacement of oil based feedstock with bio-based compostable plastics. The aim of this work is to describe the state of the art about development and use of recycled or biodegradable filaments in 3D printing.

Closed-loop recycling of plastics enabled by dynamic covalent diketoenamine bonds	NATURE CHEMISTRY			English	Article							RECYCLABLE POLYESTER; POLY(ETHYLENE-TEREPHTHALATE); THERMOSETS; STABILITY; POLYMERS; FUTURE	Recycled plastics are low-value commodities due to residual impurities and the degradation of polymer properties with each cycle of re-use. Plastics that undergo reversible polymerization allow high-value monomers to be recovered and re-manufactured into pristine materials, which should incentivize recycling in closed-loop life cycles. However, monomer recovery is often costly, incompatible with complex mixtures and energy-intensive. Here, we show that next-generation plastics-polymerized using dynamic covalent diketoenamine bonds-allow the recovery of monomers from common additives, even in mixed waste streams. Poly(diketoenamine)s 'click' together from a wide variety of triketones and aromatic or aliphatic amines, yielding only water as a by-product. Recovered monomers can be re-manufactured into the same polymer formulation, without loss of performance, as well as other polymer formulations with differentiated properties. The ease with which poly(diketoenamine) s can be manufactured, used, recycled and re-used-without losing value-points to new directions in designing sustainable polymers with minimal environmental impact.

Polymer recycling codes for distributed manufacturing with 3-D printers	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						3-D printing; Additive manufacturing; Recycling codes; Polymers; Distributed manufacturing	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; WASTE MANAGEMENT; ASSESSMENT LCA; FEEDSTOCK; PLASTICS; REPRAP; SYSTEM; DEBRIS; IMPACT	With the aggressive cost reductions for 3-D printing made available by the open-source self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) the economic advantage of custom distributed manufacturing has become substantial. In addition, the number of free designs is growing exponentially and the development and commercialization of the recyclebot (plastic extruders that fabricate 3-D printing filament from recycled or virgin materials) have greatly improved the material selection available for prosumer 3-D printer operators. These trends indicate that more individuals will manufacturer their own polymer products, however, there is a risk that an even larger fraction of polymer waste will not be recycled because it has not been coded. The current limited resin identification code available in the U.S. similarly restricts closing the loop on less popular polymers, which could hamper the environmental impact benefits of distributed manufacturing. This paper provides a solution for this challenge by (1) developing a recycling code model based off of the resin identification codes developed in China that is capable of expansion as more complex 3-D printing materials are introduced, (2) creating OpenSCAD scripts based on (1) to be used to print resin identification codes into products, (3) demonstrating the use of this functionality in a selection of products and polymer materials, and (4) outlining the software and policy tools necessary to make this application possible for widespread adoption. Overall the results showed that a far larger resin code identification system can be adopted in the U.S. to expand distributed recycling of polymers and manufacturing of plastic-based 3-D printed products.

Sustainability and feasibility assessment of distributed E-waste recycling using additive manufacturing in a Bi-continental context	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						E-waste; Recycling; Distributed manufacturing; Additive manufacturing; Plastic; Open source	POWERED 3-D PRINTERS; LIFE-CYCLE ANALYSIS; POLYMER; REPRAP; LOOP; ABS	The most abundant e-waste plastic is acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), which is not typically processed by municipal programs and is equally one of the most popular 3-D printing filaments. This makes ABS a prime candidate for the distributed recycling for additive manufacturing (DRAM) approach, which has the potential to increase recycling rates by providing economic incentive for consumers to recycle. For DRAM to be globally applicable, this study investigates the role of the ABS e-waste source and processes to fabricate 3-D printing filament and printed components in both Australia and North America. The study used two different open source extruder systems to convert e-waste into 3D printer filament and for material quality to be assessed through standardized tensile and compression testing. Results revealed a modest reduction in mechanical properties compared to virgin ABS, highlighting the potential for recycled e-waste ABS for consumer and industrial uses. We also show DRAM can significantly reduce 3-D printer filament cost, however, carbon emissions from conversion underscored the need for technical efficiency improvements in electricity generating between countries. Finally, the variations in the properties of the ABS e-waste indicates the need for appropriate labeling of materials in order to advance recycling.

This trend has produced an interest in recycled filaments, both to reduce the manufacturing cost of fabricated products and to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Also, this recycling system is very useful to make functional filament such as highly conducting or high strength filament by combining carbon nanotube or polydopamine during recycling process. This study presents the design procedures of system for making recycled filaments for 3D printers from waste polymer. The system integrates four main parts for recycling filament: a shredder, which crushes polymer waste into small pieces; an extruder, which extrudes filament from the crushed pieces; a sensing and control component, which regulates the diameter of the extruded filament via a closed-loop control system, and a spooler. Additionally, the dimensional accuracy, the mechanical strength of pristine, and recycled filaments were investigated and compared.

J	Chawla, K; Singh, R; Singh, J				Chawla, Kapil; Singh, Rupinder; Singh, Jaspreet			On recyclability of thermoplastic ABS polymer as fused filament for FDM technique of additive manufacturing	WORLD JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; Melt flow index; Fused deposition modeling; Twin-screw extruder	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; FIBER; PARTS	Purpose The thermoplastic polymers do not decompose easily due to the presence of long-chain stable polymeric structure, and thus, causes serious effects on the environment. Recycling of these polymer wastes becomes the only solution to minimize their adverse effects on the environment. The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of using recycled thermoplastic material as filament for fused deposition modeling technique. Design/methodology/approach In this study, the researchers fabricated fused filaments (in-house) for fused deposition modeling (FDM) technique of additive manufacturing from secondary recycled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) by using a twin-screw extruder. After measuring the melt flow index of the secondary recycled ABS, the twin-screw extrusion parameters (rpm/speed of the screw, extrusion temperature and load) were varied to predict their influence on the various properties (rheological/mechanical/thermal) of the fabricated filaments. Experimental work was executed as per Taguchi's L9 orthogonal array. Findings Thermal analysis performed to estimate the heat carrying capacity of recycled ABS highlighted that the heat capacity of ABS increases significantly from 0.28 J/g to 3.94 J/g during the heating cycle. The maximum value of peak strength and percentage break elongation for the fused filaments was investigated at 12.5 kg load, 2,250 C extrusion temperature and 70 rpm speed. Originality/value The filaments fabricated by recycling the polymeric waste has been successfully used in the FDM machine for the preparation of the three-dimensional printed tensile specimen.

The materials were tested in three-point bending, and the incorporation of the additives always produced a decrease of the flexural strength. The results obtained were compared with the properties of commercially available materials. In particular, PP + PE blends showed a promising mechanical performance. For the amount of flame-retardant additive used in this study, none of the compositions analyzed exhibited flame resistance. The balance between loss of mechanical strength due to the increase of the amount of flame retardant additive and lack of flame resistance was obtained by incorporating more flame retardant through a paintinglike procedure. The method proved to be an efficient way to attend the standard for building construction panels.

Large scale additive manufacturing of eco-composites	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIAL FORMING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Large-Scale; HDPE; Sawdust	3D; FABRICATION	The evolution of additive manufacturing processes is enabling the production of parts with improved dimensional accuracy, mechanical, physical and chemical properties [1]. New materials also contribute to this trend, and in this scope, eco-composites, materials with environmental and ecological advantages, which include natural polymers, have been acquiring increased relevance [2]. The purpose of this study is to develop composite material parts manufactured from recycled thermoplastics and natural fibres, in this case, wood residues. Additive manufacturing (fused deposition modelling) will be accomplished using a robot combined with extrusion unit. The objective is to access the influence of the main manufacturing parameters, such as temperature, distance between layers or deposition speed, on the final part characteristics, especially dimensional accuracy. Reverse engineering and several material analysis techniques will be employed to achieve this goal.	[Horta, J. F.; Simoes, F. J.

Recycled polyethylene terephthalate as a new FFF feedstock material	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						3D printing; Recycled plastics; Polyethylene terephthalate; FFF; Tensile; DMA; DSC	OF-THE-ART; TECHNOLOGIES; NANOFIBERS	Reclaimed materials such as waste plastics can be utilized in additive manufacturing to improve the self-reliance of war fighters on forward operating bases by cutting costs and decreasing the demand for the frequent resupplying of parts by the supply chain. In addition, the use of waste materials in additive manufacturing in the private sector would reduce cost and increase sustainability, providing a high-value output for used plastics. Experimentation is conducted to process polyethylene terephthalate bottles and packaging into filament that can then be used for additive manufacturing methods like fused filament fabrication, without the use of additives or modification to the polymer. The chemistry of different polyethylene terephthalate recycled feedstocks was evaluated and found to be identical, and thus mixed feedstock processing is a suitable approach. Rheological data showed drying of the recycled polyethylene terephthalate led to an increase in the polymer's viscosity. Thermal and mechanical properties were evaluated for filament with different processing conditions, as well as printed and molded specimens. Crystallinity ranged from 12.2 for the water cooled filament, compared to 24.9% for the filament without any active cooling. Tensile results show that the elongation to failure was similar to an injection molded part (3.5%) and tensile strength of 35.1 +/- 8 MPa was comparable to commercial polycarbonate-ABS filament, demonstrating the robustness of the material. In addition, three point bending tests showed a similar load at failure for a select long-lead military part printed from the recycled filament compared to parts printed from commercial filament. Thus filament from recycled polyethylene terephthalate has the capability for replacing commercial filament in printing a diverse range of plastic parts.

Specifically, for the first time, rPET water bottle flake is processed using only an open source toolchain with Fused Particle Fabrication (FPF) or Fused Granular Fabrication (FGF) processing rather than first converting it to filament. In this study, first the impact of granulation, sifting, and heating (and their sequential combination) is quantified on the shape and size distribution of the rPET flakes. Then 3D printing tests were performed on the rPET flake with two different feed systems: an external feeder and feed tube augmented with a motorized auger screw, and an extruder-mounted hopper that enables direct 3D printing. Two Gigabot X machines were used, each with the different feed systems, and one without and the latter with extended part cooling. 3D print settings were optimized based on thermal characterization, and both systems were shown to 3D print rPET directly from shredded water bottles. Mechanical testing showed the importance of isolating rPET from moisture and that geometry was important for uniform extrusion. The mechanical strength of 3D-printed parts with FPF and inconsistent flow is lower than optimized fused filament, but adequate for a wide range of applications. Future work is needed to improve consistency and enable water bottles to be used as a widespread DRAM feedstock.

Open Source Filament Diameter Sensor for Recycling, Winding, and Additive Manufacturing Machines	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article						additive manufacturing; advanced materials and processing; control and automation; process engineering; production systems optimization; sustainable manufacturing	LIFE-CYCLE ANALYSIS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; POLYMER; VIRGIN; REPRAP; LOOP; POLYETHYLENE; RECYCLEBOT	To overcome the challenge of upcycling plastic waste into three-dimensional (3D) printing filament in the distributed recycling and additive manufacturing systems, this study designs, builds, tests, and validates an open-source filament diameter sensor for recycling and winding machines. The modular system for multi-axis optical control of the diameter of the recycled 3D-printer filament makes it possible to scan part of the surface of the processed filament, save the history of measurements along the entire length of the spool, as well as mark defective areas. The sensor is developed as an independent module and integrated into a recyclebot. It was tested on different kinds of polymers (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactide (PLA)), different sources of plastic, and different colors including clear plastic. The results were compared with the manual measurements, and the measurements obtained with a one-dimensional digital light caliper. The results found that the developed open-source filament sensing method allows users to obtain significantly more information in comparison with basic one-dimensional light sensors and using the received data not only for more accurate diameter measurements but also for a detailed analysis of the recycled filament surface. This could help to expand the use of plastic recycling technologies in the manufacturing community. The availability of tools for possible texture analysis could also stimulate the growth of composite materials creation. The presented system can greatly enhance the user possibilities and serve as a starting point for a complete recycling control system that will regulate motor parameters to achieve the desired filament diameter with acceptable deviations and even control the extrusion rate on a printer to recover from filament irregularities.

In this way, it is feasible to provide added value from olive pits, a by-product resulting from the olive industry operations, while promoting the circular economy and reducing the use of fossil-based polymers. For this purpose, suitable samples were manufactured using 25 wt% and 40 wt% of OP. Additionally, the effect of incorporating additives was studied: (a) a process control additive (PA), and (b) a coupling agent of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP). The results showed an improvement in Young's and flexural modulus with the OP addition. The incorporation of PA did not present any significant improvement in the properties of the materials, nevertheless it facilitated the biocomposite manufacturing process. As for the coupling agent, it significantly improved the mechanical properties, achieving the best results with the addition of the two types of additives and 40 wt% of OP. Moreover, the thermal properties were maintained, and there was an increase in crystallinity in all composites compared to rPP.

Recycling of additively printed rare-earth bonded magnets	WASTE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Recycling; Bonded magnets; Cryomilling; Waste management; Additive manufacturing; Nd-Fe-B	SINTERED MAGNETS; NDFEB MAGNETS; RECOVERY; HYDROGEN; ROUTE	In this work, we describe an efficient and environmentally benign method of recycling of additive printed Nd-Fe-B polymer bonded magnets. Rapid pulverization of bonded magnets into composite powder containing Nd-Fe-B particles and polymer binder was achieved by milling at cryogenic temperatures. The recycled bonded magnets fabricated by warm compaction of ground cryomilled coarse composite powders and nylon particles showed improved magnetic properties and density. Remanent magnetization and saturation magnetization increased by 4% and 6.5% respectively, due to enhanced density while coercivity and energy product were retained from the original additive printed bonded magnets. This study presents a facile method that enables the direct reuse of end-of-life bonded magnets for remaking new bonded magnets. In addition to magnetic properties, mechanical properties comparable to commercial products have been achieved. This research advances efforts to ensure sustainability in critical materials by forming close loop supply chain. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A first set of specimens was printed with virgin PLA filament and mechanically tested. Such specimens were then ground up and reextruded into filament using a homemade extruder. The re-extruded filament was employed to manufacture a new set of specimens which were also analysed. Three recycling processes were performed to assess the effect on the mechanical properties. The obtained results suggested that 3D printing with recycled PLA may be a viable option. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

To achieve this goal, we demonstrate a nanogrid device by which solar energy can be stored in a modest sized battery system and use this to power instrumentation for melt extrusion of waste polymers into 3D printer filaments. We then use this filament in a modified 3D printer system to manufacture functional humanitarian aid components such as water seals and pipe connectors. We investigate the feasibility of the EcoPrinting principal using ABS and HDPE plastics, while evaluating and optimizing enabling device energy consumption and manufacturing performance. We conclude that the EcoPrinting principal is possible and functional devices can be manufactured with mechanical integrity equivalent to commercially available components. We finally demonstrate that EcoPrinting can be used as a tool for humanitarian use, realizing a manufacturing paradigm that is self-sufficient and potentially capable of addressing challenges of plastic proliferation in developing nations.

Thermoplastic composites offer an advantage of recyclability after their service life, but challenges and opportunities remain in the recycling of natural fiber reinforced polymer composites (NFRPCs). This article summarized the effects of reprocessing/recycling on the material properties of NFRPCs. The material properties considered include mechanical performance, thermal properties, hygroscopic behavior, viscoelasticity, degradation, and durability. NFRPCs can generally be recycled approximately 4-6 times until their thermomechanical properties change. After recycling 7 times, the tensile strength of NFRPCs can decrease by 17%, and the tensile modulus can decrease by 28%. The mitigation approaches to overcome degradation of material properties of NFRPCs such as adding functional additives and virgin plastics are also discussed. The main challenges in these approaches such as degradation and incompatibility are discussed, and an effort is made to provide a rationale for reprocessing/recyclability assessment. Future applications of NFRPCs such as additive manufacturing and automotive part use are discussed.

Fatigue behaviour of 3D printed virgin and recycled short-glass-fiber-reinforced and mineral-filled polypropylene	SECOND EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF ADDITIVELY MANUFACTURED MATERIALS	Procedia Structural Integrity		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd European Conference on the Structural Integrity of Additively Manufactured Materials (ESIAM)	SEP 08-10, 2021	Vienna Univ Technol, ELECTR NETWORK		Vienna Univ Technol	Fatigue Strength; Recycled polimers; short glass fiber reinforced polypropylene; Mineral filler; Polypropylene; Additive manufacturing		The aim of this paper is to analyse the fatigue behaviour of an additively manufactured (AM) short glass fiber reinforced polymer. The material under investigation is a recycled mineral-filled polypropylene reinforced by means of short glass fibers. The specimens have been produced by using a Pellet-based Additive Manufacturing (PAM) system, which is basically a Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) process in which the feedstock consists of pellets. The three infill patterns most commonly used in 3D printing were selected to produce dog-bone shaped specimens oriented with their axes parallel to the platform (i.e. orthogonal to the build direction). The fatigue behaviour of recycled 3D printed specimens was then compared to the results obtained from specimens made of the same material produced by injection moulding (IM). The effect of the recycling was studied only for the IM specimens by testing both the virgin and recycled compound. Finally, preliminary analyses of the macroscopic damage mechanisms were done by observing the fracture paths after fatigue failure. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Di, L; Yang, YR				Di, Lei; Yang, Yiran			Towards closed-loop material flow in additive manufacturing: Recyclability analysis of thermoplastic waste	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Waste recycling; Recyclability; Closed-loop material flow; Cleaner production	MOLECULAR-WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; POLYMER; CYCLE	Thermoplastic is one of the most popular materials used in additive manufacturing (AM). As the adoption of AM technologies has been rapidly increasing, the feasibility of recycling AM waste and the quality of recycled materials need to be investigated to facilitate closed-loop material flow and cleaner production. In current literature, studies have been performed to compare material property changes before and after recycling, and a certain level of mechanical degradation has been observed. Some material properties such as molecular weight distribution have not yet been investigated in AM recycling. In addition, the recyclability of waste materials under multiple rounds of recycling has not yet been well studied. These knowledge gaps indicate a research need for AM material recyclability evaluation and improvement. In this research, an assessment framework is proposed and implemented to evaluate the recyclability of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene in extrusion-based AM, providing guidelines for quantifying variations of molecular weight distribution, material density, fabrication quality, and mechanical properties under multiple rounds of recycling. Different process parameters and their impact on material recyclability in each round are also studied. Experimental results indicate that the ultimate tensile strength degradation after each recycling round varies from 27% to over 50%; surface roughness increases 29.54% after three rounds of recycling; molecular weight distribution of recycled materials demonstrates obvious shifts, and the polydispersity is decreased by 13.16% after three rounds of recycling. The results of this research will help AM users better understand and implement waste recycling, which will positively impact the AM community by contributing towards achieving cleaner production and enhancing the material efficiency and environmental sustainability of AM.

Circularity in mixed-plastic chemical recycling enabled by variable rates of polydiketoenamine hydrolysis	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							NONCOVALENT INTERACTIONS; DENSITY FUNCTIONALS; THERMOCHEMISTRY; MOLECULES	Footwear, carpet, automotive interiors, and multilayer packaging are examples of products manufactured from several types of polymers whose inextricability poses substantial challenges for recycling at the end of life. Here, we show that chemical circularity in mixed-polymer recycling becomes possible by controlling the rates of depolymerization of polydiketoenamines (PDK) over several orders of magnitude through molecular engineering. Stepwise deconstruction of mixed-PDK composites, laminates, and assemblies is chemospecific, allowing a prescribed subset of monomers, fillers, and additives to be recovered under pristine condition at each stage of the recycling process. We provide a theoretical framework to understand PDK depolymerization via acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and experimentally validate trends predicted for the rate-limiting step. The control achieved by PDK resins in managing chemical and material entropy points to wide-ranging opportunities for pairing circular design with sustainable manufacturing.

The REE monopoly of some countries has held the shift of humanity towards sustainability and renewable energy sources back. The isolation, recovery, and recycle of REE from waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) constitute the disengagement strategy and can lead to significant economic benefits, via sustainability. The introduction of critical raw materials (RM), derived from WEEE, as additives to filaments used for the synthesis of composite materials, employed by Additive Manufacturing (AM) applications, has tremendous potential for the performance and the commercialization of the final products by adding unique characteristics, such as antibacterial properties, enhanced mechanical and magnetic properties, and thermal and electrical conductivity. The low cost of the recycled RM, the small numbers of process stages, and the inception of a zero-waste paradigm, present its upscalability, with a realistic view to its industrial employment. Although there are many articles in literature that have reviewed WEEE recycle, a comprehensive review on the conditions, parameters, procedure flow charts, and novel properties of the final composite materials with regards to every RM is missing.

Development of new lubricating grease formulations using recycled LDPE as rheology modifier additive	EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL			English	Article						lubricating grease; additive; polyethylene; recycled polymer; rheology; microstructure	MICROSTRUCTURE; PLASTICS; FLOW	The recovery of plastic waste but also its applicability in product development may be an incentive to industry, since the use of such plastics represents a cheaper source of raw material. The aim of the present paper is to study the feasibility of recycling polyolefins as additives to improve the rheological properties of lithium 12-hydroxystearate lubricating greases. The effects that both soap and recycled low-density polyethylene (LDPE) concentration exert on the rheology of lithium lubricating greases and its relationship with grease microstructure are discussed in this work. In this way, different lubricating grease formulations were manufactured by modifying the concentration of lithium 12-hydroxystearate and content of recycled LDPE, according to a RSM statistical design. These lubricating greases were rheologically characterized through small-amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) and viscous flow measurements. In addition to these, scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) observations and mechanical stability tests were also carried out. Recycled LDPE was found to be an effective additive to modify grease rheology, acting as filler in the soap entangled microstructure. The values of both apparent viscosity and viscoelastic functions in the linear viscoelastic region increase with soap and recycled polymer concentrations. However, the addition of recycled LDPE distort the microstructural network of these greases resulting greases with less relative elastic characteristics and poorer mechanical properties as LDPE content increases.

The intent is to optimize it to an upcoming source for additive manufacturing by modulating its behavior using a chain extender triphenyl phosphite (TPP), nanofiller montmorillonite (MMT K-10), and catalyst antimony trioxide (Sb2O3). FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared) analysis showed an increase in absorbance due to the Sb2O3. The thermal analysis of the rPET using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) ascertains a 10 degrees C decrease in T-g with a substantial increase in the degradation onset of 7 degrees C due to MMT content. The melt flow index (MFI) study showed an increase with a similar range in intrinsic viscosity and weight average molecular weight (M-w) due to the additives. The percentage crystallinity, interlayer distance, and average crystallite size are determined and analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and DSC curves. The results are within the comparative range of both tests. The presence of Sb2O3 with higher MMT content showed agglomeration, and increased TPP showed low crystalline properties. These results provide that rPET can be altered to manufacture feedstock to suit different 3D printing techniques for prototyping.

They operate under a high degree of water closure leading to several problems. A new wet-end chemical program provides improved production rates and runnability without changing the incoming fiber mix. The system uses a high molecular weight cationic dispersion or emulsion polymer with a modified natural polymer. The new system does not require any change in operating conditions or involve any mechanical modifications to the paper machine.

Polymeric material extrusion processes have been broadly addressed with a specific definition of all parameters and variables for all different of technologies approaches and materials. Recycled polymeric materials have been studied due to the growing importance of the environmental awareness of the contemporary society. Beside this, little specific research has been found in product development applications for AM where the printed parts are in highly moisture environments or surrounded by water, but polymers have been for long used in such industries with conventional manufacturing approaches. This work focuses on the analysis and comparison of two different additively manufactured polymers printed by fused filament fabrication (FFF) processes using desktop-size printers to be applied for product design. The polymers used have been a recycled material: polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) and polylactic acid (PLA). Degradation and water absorption behaviors of both materials are presented, analyzed and discussed in this paper, where different samples have been immersed in saturated solutions of water with maritime salt and sugar together with a control sample immersed in distilled water. The samples have been dimensionally and weight-controlled weekly as well as microscopically analyzed to understand degradation and absorption processes that appear in the fully saturated solutions. The results revealed how the absorption process is stabilized after a reduced number of weeks for both materials and how the degradation process is more remarked in the PLA material due to its organic nature.

This chapter investigates wood filler-reinforced polymer composites, which have gained attention among the researchers and in the market in woody applications having aesthetic and low service costs. Most polymers have the increasing cost of petrochemical products while LC materials are obtained from different national resources such as different types of wood powder. LC materials are available in light, cheap, environment-friendly forms with easy maintenance. The main disadvantages of LC-reinforced composites are moisture sensitivity and poor dimensional stability, besides changing wood fiber characteristics in time and poor adhesion to basically all kind of matrix polymers. Additive usage in manufacturing is an increasing trend of wood-based LC material-reinforced polymer composite parts to penetrate new markets, with better performance requirements and long-term stability. This chapter investigates description, classification, production with common additive types and usage of wood-polymer composite materials. In addition, it approaches preprocesses to reach high productivity and high-quality product manufacturing. Finally, some experimental manufacturing results of wood-reinforced polymer composites are presented.

Sustainable Additive Manufacturing: Mechanical Response of Polyamide 12 over Multiple Recycling Processes	MATERIALS			English	Article						additive manufacturing (AM); three-dimensional (3D) printing; recycling; polyamide 12 (PA12); tensile test; flexural test; Charpy&#8217; s impact test; Vicker&#8217; s micro-hardness; scanning electron microscopy (SEM)		Plastic waste reduction and recycling through circular use has been critical nowadays, since there is an increasing demand for the production of plastic components based on different polymeric matrices in various applications. The most commonly used recycling procedure, especially for thermoplastic materials, is based on thermomechanical process protocols that could significantly alter the polymers' macromolecular structure and physicochemical properties. The study at hand focuses on recycling of polyamide 12 (PA12) filament, through extrusion melting over multiple recycling courses, giving insight for its effect on the mechanical and thermal properties of Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) manufactured specimens throughout the recycling courses. Three-dimensional (3D) FFF printed specimens were produced from virgin as well as recycled PA12 filament, while they have been experimentally tested further for their tensile, flexural, impact and micro-hardness mechanical properties. A thorough thermal and morphological analysis was also performed on all the 3D printed samples. The results of this study demonstrate that PA12 can be successfully recycled for a certain number of courses and could be utilized in 3D printing, while exhibiting improved mechanical properties when compared to virgin material for a certain number of recycling repetitions. From this work, it can be deduced that PA12 can be a viable option for circular use and 3D printing, offering an overall positive impact on recycling, while realizing 3D printed components using recycled filaments with enhanced mechanical and thermal stability.

Here, the open source Gigabot X is used to develop a new method to optimize FPF/FGF for recycled materials. Virgin polylactic acid(PLA) pellets and prints were analyzed and were then compared to four recycled polymers including the two most popular printing materials(PLA and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene(ABS)) as well as the two most common waste plastics(polyethylene terephthalate(PET) and polypropylene(PP)). The size characteristics of the various materials were quantified using digital image processing. Then, power and nozzle velocity matrices were used to optimize the print speed, and a print test was used to maximize the output for a two-temperature stage extruder for a given polymer feedstock. ASTM type 4 tensile tests were used to determine the mechanical properties of each plastic when they were printed with a particle drive extruder system and were compared with filament printing. The results showed that the Gigabot X can print materials 6.5 x to 13 x faster than conventional printers depending on the material, with no significant reduction in the mechanical properties. It was concluded that the Gigabot X and similar FPF/FGF printers can utilize a wide range of recycled polymer materials with minimal post processing.

Optimal pricing of 3D printing platform and material suppliers in a closed-loop competitive circular supply chain	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Closed-loop supply chain, 3D printing platform; Product quality differentiation; Circular economy; Industry 4.0	SPARE PARTS; POLYETHYLENE; POLYMER; ECONOMY; IMPACT; MAINTENANCE; FUTURE	Three-dimensional printing (3DP) or additive manufacturing is regarded as an environmentally friendly and sustainable form of manufacturing, which allows circular manufacturing as the 3D printed waste and products can be recycled for further 3DP operations. Due to the fact that the reclaimed material is commonly perceived to have poorer quality than the virgin material, the pricing of materials and printed products are crucial for consumers to decide their printing and material selection decisions. We consider a closed-loop competitive circular supply chain comprising (1) a 3DP platform that provides 3DP services to print products from virgin and recycled materials, (2) material suppliers that provide virgin and recycled materials (filaments) for the platform, and (3) end users who use the platform to print their products. We derive the prices, demands, and profits of the 3DP platform and material suppliers in Stackelberg equilibrium. We also conduct numerical studies using real-life data to generate practical insights from the analytical findings. Most interestingly, we find that while the platform prefers, both types of suppliers avoid, printing high-quality products from recycled material. We derive management insights and policy implications from the analytical and numerical findings for the closed-loop competitive circular supply chain.

Experimental verification of the mechanical properties was realized by testing samples produced with various concentrations of the recycled material. Experimental samples underwent tests to obtain the mechanical properties of the produced new material. These tests included rheological tests, tensile and flexural tests as well as and Charpy impact toughness tests. These mechanical tests were conducted according to ISO standards valid for the individual testing method. Testing methods were carried out using prescribed numbers of testing samples. The presented scientific article is also focused on changes in microstructures of testing materials in relation to the percentage ratio of recycled granulate.

The recycled polymers were acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene (PE), which were collected from among the construction and demolition waste (CDW) at a local waste management center. The commercial additives, such as a coupling agent and lubricant, were also included in the materials. Composite materials were manufactured with an agglomeration and an extrusion process. Water absorption and thickness swelling properties of composites, based on the recycled ABS and PE, were restricted compared to the recycled PP. The strength properties of WPC were determined with two methods, a traditional Brinell hardness and resistance to indentation. Using an ABS polymer as a matrix in the composite, the moisture and strength properties were improved. The recycled PP polymer caused these properties to be lowered, especially in the case of moisture properties. This study has shown that the method used can affect the measured value of certain properties. In addition, the sorting of recycled polymer fractions is desirable for the appearance of improved properties.

Rheological Modification of Lubricating Greases with Recycled Polymers from Different Plastics Waste	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; POLYOLEFIN BLENDS; BEHAVIOR; MICROSTRUCTURE; MORPHOLOGY; VIRGIN; BLACK; FTIR; FLOW; LDPE	There is a growing interest on the development of new materials based on recycled polymers from plastics waste, since the use of such plastics represents a low-cost source of raw material. The purpose of the present work is to evaluate, from a comparative point of view, the effect that different waste and virgin polymers, used as viscosity modifier additives, exert on the theological properties of standard lithium lubricating greases. Grease formulations containing diverse polymers, differing in nature and/or origin, were manufactured and theologically characterized. Particularly, the influences of the type of polymer, the molecular weight and the presence of carbon black, used as filler in recycled polymers, have been evaluated. Small-amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) and viscous flow measurements were carried out, as well as calorimetric and thermogravimetric analysis. In general, recycled polymers induce a more important theological modification than virgin polymers of the same nature. Thus, the addition of some recycled polymers such as HDPE, LDPE, PP, and EVA copolymer to lithium lubricating grease significantly increases the values of the theological parameters analyzed. The crystallinity degree, mainly dependent on the nature of the polymer, and the carbon black content of recycled polymers have been pointed out as the most highly influencing parameters on the rheology of the lubricating greases studied. However, an apparent loss in mechanical stability for lubricating greases containing recycled polymers has been found when they were submitted to a severe mechanical treatment.	[Martin-Alfonso, J.

Sensitive and custom-made products in different designs can be produced more easily and quickly, but waste specimen formed after the failed three-dimensional (3D) prints cause waste and environmental pollution from the expensive filament material. It is thought that such problems can be prevented by minimizing the waste when the scrap materials generated as a result of each production are recovered. This study investigated the benefits of recycling all possible waste filament specimens, including the supports removed from the part after the defective products or supported production, by granulating and reusing in the production of new parts in the next 3D production process. Mechanical differences between the 3D specimens produced with virgin filaments to be printed with recycled filaments are investigated and it has been determined that most of the countries cause environmental pollution due to the waste of materials including additive manufacturing and 3DP processes. The use of the filament material, which takes a long time to procure from abroad and is mainly procured externally, will be increased from one time to twice or thrice, thus facilitating the availability and preventing environmental pollution.

Currently, additive manufacturing have been applied for many industries such as for automotive, aerospace, medical and other commercial product. The technologies are supported by materials for the manufacturing process to produce high quality product. Plus, additive manufacturing technologies has been growth from the lowest to moderate and high technology to fulfil manufacturing industries obligation. Initially from simple 3D printing such as fused deposition modelling (FDM), poly-jet, inkjet printing, to selective laser sintering (SLS), and electron beam melting (EBM). However, the high technology of additive manufacturing nowadays really needs high investment to carry out the process for fine products. There are three foremost type of material which is polymer, metal and ceramic used for additive manufacturing application, and mostly they were in the form of wire feedstock or powder. In circumstance, it is crucial to recognize the characteristics of each type of materials used in order to understand the behaviours of the materials on high temperature application via additive manufacturing. Therefore, this review aims to provide excessive inquiry and gather the necessary information for further research on additive material materials for high temperature application. This paper also proposed a new material based on powder glass, which comes from recycled tempered glass from automotive industry, having a huge potential to be applied for high temperature application. The technique proposed for additive manufacturing will minimize some cost of modelling with same quality of products compare to the others advanced technology used for high temperature application.

Thanks to this technology, viscous inks are easily extruded for the creation of 3D structures. Nevertheless, the quick recovery of the solid-like behavior after extrusion remains one of the most crucial open issues for 3D-printable inks. The main goal herein is to improve the printability of a UV-curable thermosetting composite ink reinforced with mechanically recycled glass fiber composites by modifying its rheological behavior. The overall process is optimized, leading to the definition of the optimal extrusion parameters for these types of materials. Furthermore, the retraction mode is successfully developed for the DIW of recycled composites. Additional features are achieved, thanks to the aforementioned improvements, such as 3D complex shapes, assembled pieces, and/or moving built-in mechanisms, increasing the number of new potential applications of recycled glass fiber-reinforced polymers.

In this study, recycled short carbon fibers were combined with recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) to obtain carbon fiber-reinforced PET filaments via melt extrusion. The carbon fiber content of the extruded filaments ranged from 0.4 to 40.7 wt%. The molar mass and the degree of crystallinity after processing were determined to evaluate the influence of the extrusion process on the physico-chemical and mechanical properties of the reinforced PET filaments. Furthermore, pressure-volume-temperature measurements were carried out to investigate the influence of the carbon fibers on the shrinkage of the semi-crystalline PET. Samples were printed and their superior mechanical properties, including a 390% increase in tensile modulus, were confirmed via tensile testing. Analysis via X-ray micro-computed tomography indicated that the fiber length reduced with increasing fiber content. The high degree of fiber alignment that was observed in the extruded filaments, was slightly reduced after deposition.

Support structures, which are necessary for overhanging surfaces during production, in most cases need to be manually removed and as such, they become waste material. In this paper, experimental approach is utilised in order to assess suitability of recycling support structures into recycled filament for FFF process. Mechanical properties of standardized specimens made from recycled polylactic acid (PLA) filament as well as influence of layer height and infill density on those properties were investigated. Optimal printing parameters for recycled PLA filaments are determined with Design of Experiment methods (DOE).

However the various polymer, metallic and composite feedstocks used within additive manufacturing are mainly derived from energy consuming, inefficient methods, often originating from non-sustainable sources. This work explores the mechanical properties of additively manufactured composite structures fabricated from recycled sustainable wood waste with the aim of enhancing mechanical properties through glass fibre reinforcement. In the first instance, samples were formed by pouring formulation of wood waste (wood flour) and thermosetting binder (urea formaldehyde), with and without glass fibres, into a mould. The same formulations were used to additively manufacture samples via a layered deposition technique. Samples manufactured using each technique were cured and subsequently tested for their mechanical properties. Additively manufactured samples had superior mechanical properties, with up to 73% increase in tensile strength compared to moulded composites due to a densification of feedstock/paste and fibre in-situ directional alignment.

It is designed, built, and tested for its ability to convert post-consumer waste, 3D printed products and waste into polymer feedstock for recyclebots of fused particle/granule printers. The technical specifications of the device are quantified in terms of power consumption (380 to 404 W for PET and PLA, respectively) and particle size distribution. The open source device can be fabricated for less than $2000 USD in materials. The experimentally measured power use is only a minor contribution to the overall embodied energy of distributed recycling of waste plastic. The resultant plastic particle size distributions were found to be appropriate for use in both recyclebots and direct material extrusion 3D printers. Simple retrofits are shown to reduce sound levels during operation by 4dB-5dB for the vacuum. These results indicate that the open source waste plastic granulator is an appropriate technology for community, library, maker space, fab lab, or small business-based distributed recycling.

Such materials are excellent candidates for distributed manufacturing, in which parts are printed from local materials at the point of need. Most plastic waste streams contain a mixture of polymers, such as water bottles and caps comprised of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP), and complete separation is rarely implemented. In this work, blends of waste PET, PP and polystyrene (PS) were processed into filaments for 3D printing. The effect of blend composition and styrene ethylene butylene styrene (SEBS) compatibilizer on the resulting mechanical and thermal properties were probed. Recycled PET had the highest tensile strength at 35 +/- 8 MPa. Blends of PP/PET compatibilized with SEBS and maleic anhydride functionalized SEBS had tensile strengths of 23 +/- 1 MPa and 24 +/- 1 MPa, respectively. The noncompatibilized PP/PS blend had a tensile strength of 22 +/- 1 MPa. PP/PS blends exhibited reduced tensile strength to ca. 19 +/- 1-3 MPa with the addition of SEBS. Elongation to failure was generally improved for the blended materials compared to neat recycled PET and PS. The glass transition was shifted to higher temperatures for all of the blends except the 50-50 wt. % PP/PET blend. Crystallinity was decreased for the blends, but was highest in the 75-25 wt. % PP/PS and the 50-50 wt. % PP/PET blend with SEBS-maleic anhydride. Solvent extraction of the dispersed phase revealed polypropylene was the matrix phase in both the 50-50 wt. % PP/PET and PP/PS blends.

In the case of thermoplastics, a new recycling route is emerging, made possible by Material Extrusion additive manufacturing (MEX): distributed recycling. However, similar to what happens with mainstream recycling of these materials, the thermo-mechanical processes involved, as well as other factors such as exposure to UV-light, result in waste streams with degraded properties. This way, the possible range of applications and functionality of the polymers is reduced along with number of viable lifecycles. On this scope, the application of methods to control and modify the properties of the polymers, enhancing them or compensating for the degradation in a distributed recycling context, becomes important. Not only is this an emerging, less explored recycling route with great potential to complement the existing ones, but it also presents its own set of challenges and advantages to be explored. In this work, a systematic search methodology is followed to conduct a literature review on which the current practices on the modification and control of properties of parts produced from recycled or reprocessed thermoplastics through MEX are assessed. Research gaps and opportunities are presented from the discussion of the results. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Gomes, Tiago E.

J	Mele, M; Ricciarelli, M; Campana, G				Mele, Mattia; Ricciarelli, Michele; Campana, Giampaolo			3D printing of clay paste enhanced by scrap polymer from powder bed processes	RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Recycling; Material extrusion; Clay; Polymer powder	MULTI JET FUSION; POLYAMIDE 12; FUSED DEPOSITION; PERFORMANCE; TECHNOLOGIES; CERAMICS; CRACKING; DESIGN	Purpose Powder bed additive manufacturing processes are widespread due to their many technical and economic advantages. Nevertheless, the disposal of leftover powder poses a problem in terms of process sustainability. The purpose of this paper is to provide an alternative solution to recycle waste PA12 powder from HP multi jet fusion. In particular, the opportunity to use this material as a dispersion in three-dimensional (3D) printed clay is investigated. Design/methodology/approach A commercial fused deposition modelling printer was re-adapted to extrude a viscous paste composed of clay, PA12 and water. Once printed, parts were dried and then put in an oven to melt the polymer fraction. Four compositions with different PA12 concentration were studied. First, the extrudability of the paste was observed by testing different extrusion lengths. Then, the surface porosities were evaluated through microscopical observations of the manufactured parts. Finally, benchmarks with different geometries were digitalised via 3D scanning to analyse the dimensional alterations arising at each stage of the process. Findings Overall, the feasibility of the process is demonstrated. Extrusion tests revealed that the composition of the paste has a minor influence on the volumetric flow rate, exhibiting a better consistency in the case of long extrusions. The percentage of surface cavities was proportional to the polymer fraction contained in the mix. From dimensional analyses, it was possible to conclude that PA12 reduced the degree of shrinkage during the drying phase, while it increased dimensional alterations occurring in the melting phase. The results showed that the dimensional error measured on the z-axis was always higher than that of the XY plane. Practical implications The method proposed in this paper provides an alternative approach to reuse leftover powders from powder bed fusion processes via another additive manufacturing process. This offers an affordable and open-source solution to companies dealing with polymer powder bed fusion, allowing them to reduce their environmental impacts while expanding their production. Originality/value The paper presents an innovative additive manufacturing solution for powder reuse. Unlike the recycling methods in the body of literature, this solution does not require any intermediate transformation process, such as filament fabrication. Also, the cold material deposition enables the adoption of very inexpensive extrusion equipment. This preliminary study demonstrates the feasibility and the benefits of this process, paving the way for numerous future studies.

These polymers have been selected because they (i) present part of the plastic waste generated by the automotive industry and (ii) have totally different properties (ABS for its stiffness and robustness and TPO for its softness and ductility). The study aims to improve the circular economy of the automotive industry by proposing a promising route for recycling the generated tire rubber waste. In this respect, emergent technology for plastic processing such as 3D printing is used, as part of the additive manufacturing technologies for the prolongated end of life of recycled plastics originated from automotive waste such as ABS and TPO. The obtained results revealed that (i) the composites are suitable for successful filament production with desired composition and diameter required for successful 3D printing by fused deposition modeling, and that (ii) the optimization of the composition of the blends allows the production of materials with interesting mechanical performances. Indeed, some of the investigated ABS-recycled rubber tire blends exhibit high impact properties as TPO-based composites do, which in addition exhibits elongation at break higher than 500% and good compression properties, accompanied with good shape recovery ratio after compression.

Non-intentionally added substances (NIAS) in recycled plastics	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Mechanical-recycling; Plastics; Domestic-waste; Polyolefins; NIAS; IAS	HIGH-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE; ODORANT COMPOSITION; GAS-CHROMATOGRAPHY; CONTAMINATION; WASTE; EFFICIENCY; QUALITY; MOLDS	The demand for high quality recycled polymers in the European plastic industry is on the increase, likely due to the EU's Plastic Strategy intended to implement the circular economy model in this sector. The problem is that there is not enough recycled plastic in the market. In terms of volume, post-consumer plastic waste could be key to meet the current and future demand. Nevertheless, a high level of contamination originated during the product's life cycle restricts its use. The first step to change this must be identifying the undesired substances in post-consumer plastics and performing an effective risk assessment. The acquired knowledge will be fundamental for the development of innovative decontamination technologies. In this study, 134 substances including volatile and semi-volatile compounds have been identified in recycled LDPE and HDPE from domestic waste. Headspace and solvent extraction followed by GC/MS were used. The possible origin of each substance was studied. The main groups were additives, polymer and additives breakdown products, and contamination from external sources. The results suggest that recycled LDPE contains a broader number of additives and their degradation products. Some of them may cause safety concerns if reused in higher added value applications. Regarding recycled HDPE, the contaminants from the use phase are predominant creating problems such as intense odors. To reduce the number of undesired substances, it is proposed to narrow the variety of additives used in plastic manufacturing and to opt for separate waste collection systems to prevent cross-contamination with organic waste.

Additive manufacturing of PA12 carbon nanotube composites with a novel laser polymer deposition process	JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE			English	Article						composites; manufacturing; morphology; nanotubes; porous materials	BEHAVIOR; MICROSTRUCTURE; NANOCOMPOSITE; MECHANISM	The facile manufacture of PA12 MWCNT/silica (50/50 by weight) nanocomposite powders through a high energy mixing process is presented, which are useful to generate 3D objects by a novel Laser Polymer Deposition (LPD) process. The mixing as well as the LPD process led to no discernible changes in the material properties (DSC, SEM, LD) of the core-shell nanocomposites, enabling the recycling of unconverted powder. The built parts yield ultimate tensile stresses and Young's modulus at 10%-20% of the bulk material. Partially unmolten particles and voids were identified as the main mechanical failure mechanism in the built parts. The mechanical properties are better with low additive content (Young's modulus: 89.8 +/- 5.4 MPa; UTS: 12.9 +/- 5.3 MPa with 0.25 wt% additives). Electronic conductivity up to the region of moderate conductivity could be achieved by multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) network formation (8 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 1.25 wt% of additives). A variant of the processing strategy revealed that a higher mechanical strength can be achieved by a laser induced remelting of the traces following their initial construction.

There has been important progress in this area, with an increasing number of papers that cover diverse environmental aspects, including the circular economy, recycling and the life cycle assessment of materials. This increase is due to the importance that scientists, industry, government and society are now giving to these topics. This review seeks to develop a greater awareness in relation to the possibilities and implications in the use of the AM, as well as to encourage sustainable development by raising awareness in relation to the taking of necessary actions to achieve compliance of the Sustainable Development Goals. Similarly, current trends are examined in relation to the practices that are currently being adopted in order to ensure that AM is consolidated as a sustainable and convenient practice in the economic, social and environmental spheres. In general, polymers, ceramics, metals and composite materials are now undergoing intensive research to improve their use. Although this research shows that significant progress has been made on several relevant issues, using materials optimization to minimize energy and waste is still far from a global solution.

Separation and recycling of polymeric post-industrial waste from adhesive bandages	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Adhesive bandage; Post-industrial waste; Multiple layer; Hydro-pulping; Mechanical recycling	POLYETHYLENE; DEGRADATION; ALUMINUM; PET	The use of polymer has been showing an increasing consumption in the industry for the production of several consumer goods, mainly for the manufacturing of disposable products that can involve the combination of polymers with other materials. Nowadays, the annual production of polymers in the world exceeds 300 million tons. The industrial processes for these materials lead to a wide production of post-industrial waste that are highly complex and challenging for mechanical recycling due to the difficulty in separation step of macro-contaminant for this kind of waste. In this sense, the aim of this current study was to research and develop an efficient separation process with low cost for recycling of post-industrial scraps generated from production of adhesive bandage, which consisted of multiple layer films containing polymers, copolymers and cellulose. The polymeric waste was submitted to the well-established process called hydro-pulping, which does not require the use of chemical additives, resulting in efficient separation of cellulose pulp, while the residual polymer has been submitted to the thermomechanical processing by extrusion and injection molding. The separation of the polymers from cellulose by hydro-pulping method was successful. Therefore, the mechanical recycling of adhesive bandage waste presents full conditions for practical use.

Next, a recycling process of 3D printed carbon fiber reinforced nylon composite plain weft knitted structures is developed, to obtain recycled filament that can be directly used for 3D printing. The scanning electron microscope micrographs and the interfacial performance of the composite parts, manufactured from the original filament and the recycled one, were compared and analyzed. The results indicate that the performance of the recycled filament is continuously improving, because the recovery process enhances the infiltration of the nylon matrix into the surface of the carbon fiber. In the same printing condition, the tensile strength of composite printed with recycled filament is 56 MPa, which is improved by 16.7% compared to the composite printed using the original filament.

Like most natural fillers in 3D printing, wood particles serve mainly as a filler that lowers the cost of the printing material due to their low price. However, could wood be used as a main ingredient to affect/improve the properties of 3D-printed parts? Several advantages, such as its reinforcing ability, biodegradability, availability as waste material from other industries, ability to be used in different forms or only in partial components, recycling options or even the use of its undesirable hydromorph-induced dimensional instability for 4D printing, indicate the importance of exploring its use in 3D printing. A review of publications on 3D printing with wood biomass and technologies involving the use of wood particles and components was conducted to identify the possibilities of using wood in additive technologies and their potential.

J	Anderson, I				Anderson, Isabelle			Mechanical Properties of Specimens 3D Printed with Virgin and Recycled Polylactic Acid	3D PRINTING AND ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						PLA; recycling; mechanical properties; 3D printing; additive manufacturing	3-D; PARAMETERS; IMPACT; PLA	With the 26% annual growth rate of additive manufacturing, especially in the area of 3D polymer printing, the amount of waste is increasing at a rapid rate. Limited research in the area of recycling has been produced, yet there are several recycling machines being developed for home use. Despite this work there is no published mechanical data on components produced with filament recycled from 3D printed parts. There is very limited data on mechanical properties of any 3D printed materials. This article compares the properties of parts 3D printed with virgin polylactic acid (PLA) to those printed with recycled PLA. Using commercially available PLA and an entry level 3D printer, tensile and shear specimens were produced and then tested for tensile yield strength, modulus of elasticity, shear yield strength, and hardness. The specimens were then ground up and re-extruded into filament, and a second set of specimens were produced and tested using this recycled PLA filament. Mechanical testing showed that 3D printing with recycled PLA is a viable option. With the recycled filament, tensile strength decreased 10.9%, shear strength increased 6.8%, and hardness decreased 2.4%. The tensile modulus of elasticity was statistically unchanged. Although the average mechanical properties before and after recycling were similar, there was more variability in the results of the recycled filament. Additionally, when printing with the recycled filament there was some nozzle clogging, while none occurred with the virgin filament. Overall, the mechanical properties of specimens 3D printed from recycled PLA filament were similar to virgin properties, encouraging further development in the area of recycling 3D printed filament.

A complete cycle from cellulose to the printed object has been performed. The printed PEF objects created in the present study show higher chemical resistance than objects printed with commonly available materials (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA), glycol-modified poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PETG)). The studied PEF polymer has shown key advantages for 3D printing: optimal adhesion, thermoplasticity, lack of delamination and low heat shrinkage. The high thermal stability of PEF and relatively low temperature that is necessary for extrusion are optimal for recycling printed objects and minimizing waste. Several successive cycles of 3D printing and recycling were successfully shown. The suggested approach for extending additive manufacturing to carbon-neutral materials opens a new direction in the field of sustainable development.

Plastic Bottle Cap Recycling-Characterization of Recyclate Composition and Opportunities for Design for Circularity	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						circular economy; design for circularity; EU policy; legacy additives; mechanical recycling; plastic bottle cap; polyethylene; polypropylene; single-use plastics directive; slip agent	PET BOTTLE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; POLYOLEFIN FILMS; PRODUCT DESIGN; POLYETHYLENE; ADDITIVES; DEGRADATION; ERUCAMIDE; MIGRATION	In line with efforts to create a circular economy of plastics, recent EU legislation is strengthening plastic bottle recycling by ambitious separate collection targets and mandatory recycled content obligations. Furthermore, explicit design requirements on the caps of bottles and composite beverage packaging have been introduced. These caps are typically made of polyethylene or polypropylene and often contain additives such as slip agents and anti-statics. Commercially available bottle cap recyclates (BCRs) as well as specifically formulated model compounds were analyzed in terms of composition by means of infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and high-performance liquid chromatography. Their composition was found to be heterogeneous due to polyolefin cross-contamination, directly reflecting the diversity of cap materials present in the market. Slip agent legacy additives originating from the initial use phase were found and quantified in both commercial and model cap recyclates. This highlights the opportunity for redesigning plastic bottle caps not only in response to regulatory requirements, but to pursue a more comprehensive strategy of product design for circularity. By including considerations of polymer resin and additive choice in cap manufacturing, more homogeneous waste streams could be derived from plastic bottle cap recycling, enabling recycling into more demanding and valuable applications.

The primary issue after price is quality. This has been addressed primarily from the food safety perspective and not from the quality as it relates to flavor and taste. It is generally accepted, that if quality requirements are satisfied, then the material safety data will also meet the requirements. This paper is directed toward the technology required to produce recycled polymers that met the safety and quality assurance needed to satisfy the consumer product companies. We will be discussing the specific areas of: 1) Supply feedstock continuity and handling 2) Process Instrumentation and Control Strategy 3) Migration testing for Indirect Food Additives The basic premise of the technology is to provide Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) with the ability to have systems in place controlling the critical parameters. These will be addressed in the following area: 1) Statistical Automatic Sampling 2) Detection, Measurement and Control of Process and Quality 3) Recycling Process Control (SPC/ISO 9000) 4) Food Container Manufacturing Various known contaminates required by both Government and Industry testing, need to be correlated to ''Real World Data'' for both safety and quality of the food products.

These cost barriers can be surmounted by eliminating the entire process of fusing filament by three-dimensional (3-D) printing products directly from polymer granules. Fused granular fabrication (FGF) (or fused particle fabrication (FPF)) is being held back in part by the accessibility of low-cost pelletizers and choppers. An open-source 3-D printable invention disclosed here allows for precisely controlled pelletizing of both single thermopolymers as well as composites for 3-D printing. The system is designed, built, and tested for its ability to provide high-tolerance thermopolymer pellets with a number of sizes capable of being used in an FGF printer. In addition, the chopping pelletizer is tested for its ability to chop multi-materials simultaneously for color mixing and composite fabrication as well as precise fractional measuring back to filament. The US$185 open-source 3-D printable pelletizer chopper system was successfully fabricated and has a 0.5 kg/h throughput with one motor, and 1.0 kg/h throughput with two motors using only 0.24 kWh/kg during the chopping process. Pellets were successfully printed directly via FGF as well as indirectly after being converted into high-tolerance filament in a recyclebot.

It is shown that physically recycled PET can be used in the blends with other polymers, such as high and low density polyethylene, polycarbonates, polyvinyl chloride, etc. The compatibilizers and other additives often are used to obtain valuable blends of recycled PET with virgin or other plastics. Molecular weights of blended polymers must be similar to obtain the compatible blends of recycled PET with other plastics, therefore, additional processes are needed for the lowering average molecular weights of the polymers. Chemically recycled PET by esterifying the polyester with an excess of reactant such as diols, diamines, alcohols, or water can be used as starting ingredients for synthesis of other polymers. A focus on the production of oligoesters coming from the glycolysis of PET waste that have been introduced as a starting material in the manufacture of polyurethanes, unsaturated polyesters and saturated polyester plasticizers is done. A possibility of new application of acrylate/methacrylate PET oligomers for UV curable coatings, useful for wood surfaces, paints and other applications is decribed.

Development of polyurethane/polyethylene terephthalate/fiber glass polymeric composite from internal auto parts waste	PROGRESS IN RUBBER PLASTICS AND RECYCLING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						Mechanical recycling; manufacturing additives; mechanical properties; fractography; interfacial bonding	THERMOPLASTIC POLYURETHANE; BLENDS; POLYETHYLENE; MORPHOLOGY; POLYESTER; IMPACT	The use of polymers in the automotive industry has been growing significantly, the recycling of these materials is a major challenge nowadays, since most polymer parts comprises of different types of polymers, and they are joined by chemical adhesives due to their lack of good compatibility. This characteristic hampers the recycling of such polymers, and makes separation economically unfeasible, as a consequence, their final destination has ended up in landfills. In this sense, the present research developed a technique to verify the recyclability of the manufacturing waste polymer auto parts from industry processes, through the polymer layup process to obtain a composite (fiberglass, polyester fiber, polyurethane) in the form of flat panel. To achieve the objectives, the polymers were individually analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry to assist in the definition of the overlap of joined polymers, in which differentiates from the conventional method of polymer blend by extrusion. The preformed polymer was consolidated by a hot press. The polymer composites were evaluated by three-point bending test and their structure was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results in flexural properties indicate a suitable consolidation strategy when compared with results in literature, which is explained by the presence of glass fiber and PET in the final composition. Through the SEM images, it enabled to observe a good interface between the glass fiber and the polyester-based polymer matrix of the wastes, directly influencing the mechanical results of the material.

A literature survey on structural integrity of 3D printed virgin and recycled ABS and PP compounds	1ST VIRTUAL EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON FRACTURE - VECF1	Procedia Structural Integrity		English	Proceedings Paper	1st European-Structural-Integrity-Society (ESIS) Virtual European Conference on Fracture (ECF)	JUN 29-JUL 01, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	European Struct Integr Soc		Recycled Plastics; Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene; Polypropylene; Short Glass Fiber Reinforced; Mechanical Properties; Fatigue; Review		Plastics are used in a wide range of engineering applications in different industrial sectors like electronics, automotive, construction, packaging, white goods. Thanks to a combination of low-cost, ease of manufacturing and processing, excellent physical and chemical properties combined with adequate mechanical properties for structural applications, a tremendous and continuous increase in the consumption of polymer materials has occurred worldwide. However, the flip side of this ever-increasing consumption is the huge amount of waste, leading to deleterious environmental, health and economic impacts. Besides the use of recycled plastics, another important factor contributes to a material-efficient approach in the manufacturing industry; it is the mechanical design for 3D printing (or additive manufacturing), where minimum material usage complying with lightweight, stiffness and strength requirements is pursued by topology optimization. In this technical and economical international scenario, the present paper presents a bibliographic survey concerning the structural durability of additively manufactured recycled plastics and compounds. In particular, the paper is aimed at investigating the structural durability of three "families" of recycled plastics (rPlastic), i.e. rABS, rPP and rPP/glass fiber compound. Therefore, a literature survey regarding the considered materials will be presented by focusing on the influence of the 3D-printing process parameters on their mechanical and fatigue properties. Finally, a comparison between the results found in the literature of 3D-printed and traditionally manufactured polymers will be reported. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

For a common automotive plastic material such as polypropylene (PP), expected consequences of repeated processing are polymer chain scission due to thermal and mechanical stress, oxidation, contamination, and changes in the composition of additives. In this study, we describe a systematic chemometric approach towards quantitative prediction models for a target value, exemplified by the recyclate content in PP. Based on a multimodal material analysis, a feature matrix is composed from large, heterogeneous datasets through dimensionality reduction. Analytical methods include infrared spectroscopy, Raman microscopy, combined thermodesorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, as well as size exclusion and high performance liquid chromatography. Analytical features and prediction models are then selected and scored. We show that the weight content of recyclate can be predicted with an accuracy ~2% using simple linear models. We present an outlook for model deployment to the factory floor by using fast, non-destructive analytics such as IR spectroscopy.

Chemically induced repair, adhesion, and recycling of polymers made by inverse vulcanization	CHEMICAL SCIENCE			English	Article							DYNAMIC COVALENT POLYMERS; ORGANIC SULFUR CHEMISTRY; ELEMENTAL SULFUR; BARRIER HEIGHTS; WASTE; DESULFURIZATION; POLYMERIZATION	Inverse vulcanization is a copolymerization of elemental sulfur and alkenes that provides unique materials with high sulfur content (typically >= 50% sulfur by mass). These polymers contain a dynamic and reactive polysulfide network that creates many opportunities for processing, assembly, and repair that are not possible with traditional plastics, rubbers and thermosets. In this study, we demonstrate that two surfaces of these sulfur polymers can be chemically joined at room temperature through a phosphine or amine-catalyzed exchange of the S-S bonds in the polymer. When the nucleophile is pyridine or triethylamine, we show that S-S metathesis only occurs at room temperature for a sulfur rank > 2-an important discovery for the design of polymers made by inverse vulcanization. This mechanistic understanding of the S-S metathesis was further supported with small molecule crossover experiments in addition to computational studies. Applications of this chemistry in latent adhesives, additive manufacturing, polymer repair, and recycling are also presented.

By observing these solutions, the recycling system from the waste collection and separation system of the long-term disappearing of polymer waste to the additive manufacturing design stage has been indicated. Waste collection and separation systems have been reviewed and systems to be used effectively in the systematic way have been exemplified. Among four different separating systems which are with rotating, rail and fixed containers, fixed container four-sorting waste separation systems were chosen and developed as a mechatronic system design. The mechatronic system design is very prominent in order to create efficient and economical mechanisms in fixed-container four-sorting waste separation collection system (FCWS) applications. In addition, physical mechatronic system design (MSD), mechanical design, material selection, electrical electronic design sub-heading and cost analysis were made. In this study, the necessity and importance of the waste separation plants are revealed.

Although FFF is growing into a manufacturing device with considerable technological and material innovations, there still is a challenge to convert FFF-printed prototypes into functional objects for industrial applications. Polymer components manufactured by FFF process possess, in fact, low and anisotropic mechanical properties, compared to the same parts, obtained by using traditional building methods. The poor mechanical properties of the FFF-printed objects could be attributed to the weak interlayer bond interface that develops during the layer deposition process and to the commercial thermoplastic materials used. In order to increase the final properties of the 3D printed models, several polymer-based composites and nanocomposites have been proposed for FFF process. However, even if the mechanical properties greatly increase, these materials are not all biodegradable. Consequently, their waste disposal represents an important issue that needs an urgent solution. Several scientific researchers have therefore moved towards the development of natural or recyclable materials for FFF techniques. This review details current progress on innovative green materials for FFF, referring to all kinds of possible industrial applications, and in particular to the field of Cultural Heritage.

Particularly, shear mixing of shredded WPs with an aqueous solution of a polymer binder like polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) yields aqueous pastes suitable for 3D printing. As a shear thinning additive, both WP and microfibrillated cellulose account for enhanced shear thinning and dimensional stability. Opposite to the formation of dense WP/PVA composites by melt extrusion, 3D printing of aqueous pastes produces cellular cellulose/PVA composites exhibiting hierarchical pore architectures. In spite of low densities around 0.8 g cm(-3), high Young's modulus (2.0 GPa) and tensile strength (53 MPa) are achieved. Mechanical stability, water resistance, and even flame retardancy simultaneously improve by crosslinking with glyoxal and especially by mineralization. Multimaterial 3D printing combines the 3D dispensing of cellulose/PVA pastes with the simultaneous, staged, or subsequent spraying of aqueous water glass to enable mineralization of composite surface, bulk, and interlayers. Furthermore, the glyoxal-mediated crosslinking affords thermo- and moisture-responsive cellulose/PVA composites with programmable shape change induced either by heating at 100 degrees C or by exposure to moisture at 37 degrees C.

Recycling this powder has implications on the life cycle modeling of the SLS product, as well as the subsequent injection-molded component. This study investigates the life cycle primary energy demand (PED) and global warming potential (GWP) of an automotive fuel-line clip produced with recycled polyamide 12 (PA12) from an SLS process in comparison to the conventional polyamide 66 (PA66) counterpart, based on real-world industry data. In addition, the life cycle PED and GWP of an SLS part are examined, with and without recycling PA12 from the SLS process. The results indicate a strong dependence on the approach to evaluate the environmental burden of waste PA12 from the SLS process (cut-off, mass-based allocation, economic allocation, and substitution). Compared with the PA66 fuel-line clip, the recycled PA12 (rPA12) clip reduces the life cycle GWP by up to 26% (cut-off) or increases by up to 68% (mass-based allocation). For the SLS part, recycling PA12 powder provides a 42% reduction to its life cycle GWP (mass-based allocation). Finally, from an expanded two-part system perspective, the recycling of PA12 from the SLS process provides an 8% reduction in life cycle GWP. Similar trends are shown for the life cycle PED profiles. This study demonstrates the importance of recycling additive manufacturing (AM) wastes within a broader cascading system to improve the environmental performance of AM and the circular economy across industrial systems.

However, the use of recycled carbon fibers in 3D printing is almost unexplored, especially for thermoset-based composites. This paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility of recycled carbon fibers 3D printing via UV-assisted direct ink writing. Pyrolyzed recycled carbon fibers with a sizing treatment were firstly shredded to be used as a reinforcement of a thermally and photo-curable acrylic resin. UV-differential scanning calorimetry analyses were then performed to define the material crosslinking of the 3D printable ink. Because of the poor UV reactivity of the resin loaded with carbon fibers, a rheology modifier was added to guarantee shape retention after 3D printing. Thanks to a customized 3D printer based on a commercial apparatus, a batch of specimens was successfully 3D printed. According to the tensile tests and Scanning Electron Microscopy analysis, the material shows good mechanical properties and the absence of layer marks related to the 3D printing. These results will, therefore, pave the way for the use of 3D printed recycled carbon fiber reinforced polymers in new fields of application.

The fabricated polymer components require diverse properties for different applications and some of these properties can be obtained by using polymer composite filaments consisting of various materials in different proportions. Therefore, it is imperative to understand how different properties are affected by various compositions of materials in FFF fabricated polymer components. This study evaluates and compares various properties such as microstructure and surface texture, mechanical behavior, thermal properties, and other general characteristics of different polymer composites fabricated by 3-D printing technology. For this purpose, six polymer composite specimens are prepared where Polylactic acid (PLA) and High-density polyethylene (HDPE) are the primary materials in all of them. Recycled plastic and (or) TiO2 nanoparticles are mixed in four specimens, and graphene coating is done in two samples. Extruded filaments are consumed in the (FFF process, where the process parameters are determined under an optimization model from machine learning. FESEM, EDX, and Particle analysis confirm that the nozzle temperature, derived from machine learning, perfectly aligns with the polymers' surface texture, layer, and microstructure. Graphene-coated samples show good profiles in roughness testing. Regarding mechanical behavior analysis, tensile strength, elongation, and hardness tests are conducted. Here, the sample infused with 1% nanoparticle but void of recycled plastic presents sufficient mechanical strength, and the graphene-coated samples show the improved property in terms of elongation. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analysis authenticated the thermal properties of the samples. FTIR analysis identified the general characteristics in all specimens except the one with graphene-coating and recycled plastic.

The objective of this research was to determine some physical and mechanical parameters of composite made with Pinus taeda and elliottii wood flour (WF) and recycled polypropylene (PP), without the use of compatibilizers or additives. The composites were separated into four traits, namely 100% PP, 90% PP with 10%, WF 80% PP with 20% WF and 70 % PP with 30% WF. The characterization of the composite followed the standards ASTM D-638-10, ASTM D256-00, ASTM D570 -98, ASTM D1238 -10 and ASTM G 155-05, it was also employed the surface analysis by scanning electron microscopy. The dimensional stability tests showed satisfactory results. Even the composite with a higher percentage of wood flour (30%) had a flow index of 10 MFI, considered compatible with that observed for PP (polypropylene) virgin by standard ASTM D 1238-10. The inclusion of wood flour (FM) afforded composites with good mechanical characteristics which can be applied in manufacture of different materials, specifically employed outdoors.

Recycling wood from construction and demolished structures and combining it with plastics forms wood-polymer composites (WPC) which have a very wide scope of usage. Such recycled composites have very low environmental impact in terms of abiotic potential, global warming potential, and greenhouse potential. Processing of WPCs can be easily done with predetermined strength values that correspond to its end application. Yet, the usage of conventional polymer composite manufacturing techniques such as injection molding and extrusion has very limited scope. Many rheological characterization techniques are being followed to evaluate the influence of formulation and process parameters over the quality of final WPCs. It will be very much interesting to carry out a review on the material formulation of WPCs and additives used. Manufacturing of wood composites can also be made by using bio-based adhesives such as lignin, tannin, and so on. Nuances in complete replacement of synthetic adhesives as bio-based adhesives are also discussed by various researchers which can be done only by complete understanding of formulating factors of bio-based adhesives. Wood composites play a significant role in many non-structural and structural applications such as construction, floorings, windows, and door panels. The current review focuses on the processing of WPCs along with additives such as wood flour and various properties of WPCs such as mechanical, structural, and morphological properties. Applications of wood-based composites in various sectors such as automotive, marine, defense, and structural applications are also highlighted in this review.

The manufacturing of such thermoplastic resins and products has increased dramatically over the last 70 years. The plastics based on polyolefins, polystyrenes, and polyesters occupy the largest share (80%) of the world's plastic markets. However, the disposal of waste plastics has created considerable environmental concerns. Therefore, environment protection agencies and plastic manufacturers are constantly seeking appropriate techniques for recycling or upcycling waste plastics into new products. In recent years, the recycling rates are approximately 9 to 15% out of total plastics produced annually in the United States and Europe, which are predominantly limited to individual plastic fractions such as HDPE and PET. The recycling process is associated with various expensive and time-consuming sorting techniques, which are not economically attractive to the recycling industries. A significant issue is when multiple plastics are blended, they often are not chemically compatible, resulting in phase separation and inferior-quality materials. Therefore, it is important to apply certain performance modifiers during the re-extrusion of waste thermoplastics, which include compatibilizers, coupling agents, impact modifiers, and many others. There are different additives and techniques available, suitable to improve the mechanical and other associated properties of polymer blends and composites, and these can also be used for improving the performance of recycled thermoplastics. This review article summarizes various chemical additives and approaches, which can be used in thermomechanical upcycling of waste thermoplastics to new materials with superior mechanical performance via improving interfacial adhesion or phase homogeneity of polymer blends.

The purpose of this study is to find proper utilization of these waste powders by developing filaments from these powders for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process. In order to develop filament materials, polyamide powders PA 12 (Nylon material) are mixed with various weight percentages (12.5, 25, 37.5 and 50) of tungsten carbide to enhance mechanical properties. To determine the suitability of powder mixtures for FDM, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Melt flow index (MFI) tests are performed: A single screw extruder is used to process these powder mixtures to form filaments for testing. It is found that the addition of tungsten carbide has increased glass transition temperature, MFI and the strength of resulting polyamide-tungsten carbide composites. Moreover, filaments possess comparable and better strength than existing filaments, which are used to successfully build 3D parts from an FDM system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, the increasing demand for PVC and current ineffective disposal methods have made it a potentially severe environmental hazard. The chemical recycling of PVC through hydrolytic or aminolytic routes has shown significant promise, however, their end applications have been limited as of now. This study is concerned with the chemical modification of PVC by amines into additives, and its ensuing use as a performance enhancing modifier for bitumen. In view of this, additives were firstly synthesised by the amination of PVC with two kinds of polyamines; triethylenetetramine (TETA) and ethylene diamine (ED) respectively. These were then chemically characterised by solid state Nuclear Magnetic resonance (NMR) and elemental analysis. Subsequently, the aminated PVC additives were blended with virgin asphalt binder and its effectiveness was evaluated in terms of moisture susceptibility and rheological properties. The results of the preliminary laboratory studies indicated that the binders modified with the additives showed significantly improved anti-stripping properties and overall rheological performance as compared to conventional binder. Overall, the usage of such waste PVC based additives as modifier for bituminous mixtures represents an innovative approach to deal with a relevant recycling problem while simultaneously recovering a value-added material.

The work purpose is to monitor the changes in the characteristics of petroleum bitumen when it interacting with polymers: thermoplastic elastomer, low-density polyethylene, including the adhesive additive presence. To carry out the research a special laboratory facility was designed and manufactured with two blade mixers providing intensive turbulent mixing and the possibility to effect on the transition process of combining the components in a polymer-bitumen binder. To construct a mathematical model of the polymer-bitumen binder characteristics dependence from the composition, methods of statistical experiments planning were used. The possibility of the expensive thermoplastic elastomers replacement with polyethylene is established while maintaining acceptable polymer-bitumen binder quality parameters. The obtained results are proposed for use in road construction. They allow to reduce the roads construction cost with solving the problem of recycling long-term waste packaging from polyethylene.

Recycling of polymer waste with SiC/Al2O3 reinforcement for rapid tooling applications	MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Recycled polymer; HDPE; FDM; Mechanical properties	CONCRETE; COMPOSITES	In this research work an effort has been made to develop in house feed stock filament wire made up of recycled polymer waste as base matrix with SiC/Al2O3 reinforcement for sustainable development. The process starts with collection of waste polymer (high density polyethylene (HDPE) as a case study) from local industry. After manual segregation of contamination from waste polymer, initially rheological and thermal properties like: melt flow index (MFI), melting temperature, decomposition and enthalpy of the base polymer as well as reinforced with ceramic particle in different proportions, were tested. Further based upon thermal properties different proportions of HDPE, SiC and Al2O3 were prepared by using mini compounder (twin screw extruder) to ensure uniform dispersion. After this single screw extruder was used to prepare filament wire of uniform diameter for fused deposition modelling (FDM) setup. The filament wire so prepared was tested for its tensile properties by using universal testing machine (UTM) and various mechanical properties like: peak strength, break strength, percentage elongation and peak load etc. were established. Finally scanning electron micrographs (SEM) were obtained to understand the distribution of ceramic particles in filament wire. This study highlights the detailed procedure for managing the polymer waste with novel method by using recycled polymer as rapid tooling. This will enhance the sustainability and also helps to develop low cost, in-house open source FDM setup, rapid tooling (as ceramic particles in filament wire will enhance surface properties).

However, additive manufacturing of HDPE by means of fused deposition modeling (FDM) also known as fused filament fabrication (FFF) has been problematic owing to its massive shrinkage, voiding and warpage problems accompanied by its poor adhesion to common build plates and to extruded HDPE strands. Herein we overcome these problems and improve Young's modulus, tensile strength and surface quality of 3D printed HDPE by varying 3D printing parameters like temperature and diameter of the nozzle, extrusion rate, build plate temperature, and build plate material. Both nozzle diameter and printing speed affect surface quality but do not impair mechanical properties. Particularly, an extrusion rate gradient prevents void formation. For the first time additive manufactured HDPE and injection-molded HDPE exhibit similar mechanical properties with exception of elongation at break. Excellent fusion of the extruded polymer strands and the absence of anisotropy are achieved, as verified by microscopic imaging and measuring the tensile strength parallel and perpendicular to the 3D printing direction.

Under the traffic action, always more constraint and the climatic blitzes, the pavements crumbling occurs rapidly, which leads to severe impairments that are reflected on the surface layers: rutting, cracking, substances rejection, polishing and pulling out the aggregates on surface. This situation often involves the renovation of the surface's layers. It is, therefore urgent to appeal to a new vision of pavement design based on optimizing the use of local materials, non-renewable, and respect for the environment. The recycling of bituminous substances are one of the relevant solutions. It has the advantage of reusing building materials by mixing them with a proportion of refined ones to achieve the required performance. This assignment researches for different rates of coated aggregates, the effects of manufacturing temperature and blending time in the mixing of the constituents during production as well as the additive plastomers of polyolefins on the improvement of the recycled asphalt rutting. Rutting is one of the most encountered degradation phenomena in the Algerian roads. The formulated hypothesis used here assumes that the elastomer polyolefins additive have an influence on the mechanical performance (rutting) of the recycled asphalt and also on the rate of the used asphalt aggregates. To justify this hypothesis it is mandatory to go through the manufacture of the asphalt with different rate of asphalt aggregates. To reduce the number of experimental tests necessary for this study, we used the experimental approaches method.

Wind turbine blades are the most sophisticated and at the same time, one of the largest part of the wind energy systems. During the breakdown or at the end of life period of a blade, the disposal of the blade material is a serious concern. Hence, the study of recycling and reusing the wind turbine blade is essential. The present work is a review on recycling and reuse of wind turbine blades that includes techniques of recycling, diverse materials used for blade manufacturing, wastage of materials during the different stages of its lifecycle and the energy consumption of particular recycling processes along with the energy content of the blade materials. The commonly used materials for wind turbine blades are polymers (Polyester (PE) resin, Epoxy (EP) resin and Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) and fibers (Glass Fiber (GF) and Carbon Fiber (CF)); among these the CF has the highest recycling energy consumption of 183-286 MJ/kg. The different types of processes used for the recycling of wind turbine blade are mechanical, thermal (pyrolysis and oxidation in fluidized bed) and chemical. The recycling energy consumption for mechanical processes are minimal (0.27/3.03 MJ/kg), whereas the same for chemical processes are highest (63-91 MJ/kg).Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The possibility for utilizing this polystyrene product waste to act as a low profile additive was investigated. Low-profile thermoplastic additives are primarily employed to limit the volume shrinkage during curing of unsaturated polyester composites. A novel process has been developed to recycle polystyrene foam by dissolving it in non-volatile soybean oil esters in place of styrene. This substitution eliminates the environmentally unfriendly vapors emitted by styrene without significantly jeopardizing the composite properties, The resin systems were systematically compared in terms of pertinent chemical and mechanical properties. Polyester resin systems augmented with soy oil esters - polystyrene showed improved elongation than the unmodified polyester resins, because the co-polymer is more flexible than the conventional polyester resin. Natural fiber-reinforced composites based on the low profile resin systems were successfully manufactured. Finally, mechanical and chemical properties were tested for comparison with virgin polyester resin.

The focus is also on the effect of multiple closed-loop recycling of ABS. Design/methodology/approach A conventional direct-drive, Cartesian-type machine and a Bowden, Delta-type machine with an infrared radiant heating system are used to manufacture test specimens molded in ABS. Afterward, multiple closed-loop recycling cycles are conducted, involving consecutive AM (four times) and recycling (three times). The rheological, mechanical, morphological and physicochemical properties are investigated. Findings The type of machine affects the quality of the produced parts. The machine containing an infrared radiant system in a temperature-controlled chamber produces parts showing higher mechanical properties and filling fraction, although it increases the yellowing. Closed-loop recycling of ABS for AM is applicable for at least two cycles, inducing a slight increase in tensile modulus (ca. 5%) and in tensile strength (ca. 13%) and a decrease in the impact strength (ca. 14%) and melt viscosity. An increase in the filling fraction of the AM parts promotes an increase in tensile strength and tensile modulus, although it does not influence the impact strength. Furthermore, multiple closed-loop recycling does not affect the overall chemical structure of ABS. Practical implications Controlling the environmental temperature and using infrared radiant heating during AM of ABS improves the quality of the produced parts.

Additive manufacturing technologies have developed greatly over the last decade in terms of technology and printing materials. Special emphasis is placed on the development of cheaper materials derived from natural sources, without the release of harmful substances during the manufacturing process, with the possibility of using waste materials and recycling after service life. Wood or wood residues are among the potential raw materials that could be used for 3D printing in combinations with natural and synthetic polymers. It is anticipated that, with the development of additive technologies, the use of wood will also expand to the area of structural elements, such as in the construction of prefabricated houses. A review of publications on the topic of 3D printing with natural raw materials with an emphasis on wood biomass and technologies, where the use of wood particles is possible, was made. Some case studies of ongoing research as well as student's workshop on 3D printing design and developments will be presented.

The amount of brominated flame retardant (mainly tetrabromobisphenol-A) leached in curing water of RPAs was quantified using extraction with an organic solvent and gas chromatography methods (CG-FID). A clear relationship can be established between the characteristics of the stabilizing additive used and the amount of tetrabromobisphenol-A and bisphenol-A leached. The additive used was activated carbon, which in a manufacture scale may be provided by different suppliers with different mesoporous characteristics, which can be easily determined by the iodine number. The analysis proposed can be an effective way to determine if a particular activated carbon can be used as stabilizing additive in the production of RPAs with the developed technology.

Reclaimed low density polyethylene (RLDPE), reclaimed low-density polyethylene with polymer additives consisting of 0.25% by weight of Cyasorb(R) UV-3346 Light Stabilizer; 0.25% by weight of Cyasorb(R) UV-531 Light Stabilizer: and 0.08% by weight of Cyanox(R) 2777 Antioxidant (RLDPE-PA), and virgin low-density polyethylene (LDPE) were pulverized to ultrafine powders ranging from 20 to 300 mu m, and utilized to impregnate a separated fiberglass tow. After initial experiments, two powder-impregnated composite tubes were manufactured for each thermoplastic material system. The composites were then tested for tensile (hoop) strength and compressive bending strength under the ASTM D2290-95 and C-ring tests, respectively. This study showed that while the RLDPE composite did not perform well, composite samples made with RLDPE and polymer additives (i.e., RLDPE-PA) performed better than RLDPE samples but not as well as composites made of virgin LDPE. The impregnation and consolidation steps in the manufacturing process were also effective for all three systems. The composite tubes exhibited very low void contents and high fiber volume fractions, while unmelted and unconsolidated thermoplastic powders were not present in the manufactured parts. The absence of fiber waviness and fiber migration through the thickness of the composite demonstrates that the online consolidation of powder-impregnated fibers was also effective. The collection of the separated powder-impregnated fibers prior to filament winding also seemed to be sufficient.

A giant amount of waste, such as: electronics/electrical items, manufacturing scrap, discarded constructional materials, polymers from daily needs, etc., is being generated day-by-day, whereas its treatment is lagging. The term zero waste (ZW) is continuously encouraging both producers and consumers to adopt sustainable approaches in order to reduce their expenditures as well as to help in making a better world. In the past, researchers have highlighted numerous techniques to tackle physical waste, however the chemicals which are normally generated from this waste is more critical and limitedly reported. Zero Waste Manufacturing (ZWM) is believed as a roadmap for future of manufacturing by which the burning issue of "Waste" can be tackled. However, ZWM can be supported with recycling and reusability of the produced wastes in another manufacturing process, use of optimization tools and sustainable manufacturing theories, development of precision manufacturing systems, etc. This review article is taken up to discuss various recent sustainable manufacturing ideas applied in the prominent sectors with an aim to either re-cycle/re-use the discarded ones or to produce a fresh part in eco-friendly manners. Special attention is paid to the current trends in machining and a brief case study of sustainable manufacturing of aerospace industry has also been discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Recycling this waste as building materials is considered as a feasible solution to the environmental issue, but it is also a feasible solution to the issue of building economic design. This research aims to study the possibility of using plastic waste in the manufacture of unconventional bricks that are light in weight, environmentally friendly, inexpensive, and as an alternative to traditional bricks made from fossilized clays for use in the construction industries. In this paper, we use the remnants of medical syringes made of low-density polyethylene and two types of additives were added sawdust and sand in different proportions. The melting and moulding process was used in manufacturing. Testing has been conducted to identify hardness, density, water absorption, compressive strength and also to determine morphology properties by FTIR and SEM. The results showed that bricks made of plastic and sawdust gave a high compressive strength of 66?pa at 20% of sawdust higher than bricks made of plastic and sand with a value of 61?pa at 60% of sand. In both cases, they gave a higher compressive strength than ordinary bricks, as well as a very low absorption rate. The density was very low, especially with sawdust, where the highest value was 0.8985 g/cm(3)of pure polymer, and for sand, it was 1.4321 g/cm3 at 60% of sand and it gave good hardness values. The FTIR results showed that there is no chemical reaction, but only a physical reaction between the polymer and the additives, and through SEM, it was observed that there is homogeneity between the polymer and the additives. As a result, the study presents a new line of investigation into the sustainable recycling of the circular economy of waste thermoplastics. Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The comparative analysis was performed between two manufacturing processes using black recycled Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) pellets to evaluate the potential environmental impacts between Injection moulding and Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM). The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the Unit Process Life Cycle Inventory (UPLCI) methodology were adopted, which resulted in an impact assessment separated by operation modes and subunits of the equipment. The LCA results indicate a lower environmental impact of the FDM when the aim is to produce a batch size smaller than 14 parts. For batch sizes above 50 parts, the Injection moulding process generated less impact to the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Cumulative Energy Demand (CED). The printing stage contributed the most to generating impacts for the FDM. In the Injection moulding process, the main responsible for generating impacts were the injection phase. Mechanical tensile tests were carried out with the parts obtained by the FDM with different infills (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%), and it was observed that parts with 100% infill obtained the best relation between mechanical properties and environmental impacts.

In that sense, recycled polyurethane foam (PUF) particles were added (up to 10% wt/wt) to thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) to prepare 3D printed products. From the results, it was observed that the presence of PUF particles reduces the density of filaments. Moreover, even though filler and matrix are polyurethane (PU) polymers, the fact that PUF scraps consists of crosslinked PU, it affects inter-layer adhesion, reducing the mechanical performance of the 3D printed specimens, especially when high PUF particles contents were used. Nonetheless, despite of the limitations identified, the addition of PUF particles did not affect the thermal stability of the composites, meaning that these composites can be processed at high temperatures. Therefore, PUF scraps were successfully reused which proved to be a low cost additive for the production 3D printed composites (when using low content), with the advantage of being an alternative to the disposal of PUF.

In first stage, recycled low density polyethylene (LDPE) has been selected as matrix material, while ceramic reinforcement of SiC and Al2O3 has been blended in LDPE by screw extrusion. Initially, the recycled LDPE has been collected in granules form from the local market and processed on single screw extruder to prepare pallets. The ceramic particles and LDPE were blended together to prepared the final blend in different proportions on twin screw extruder. After that Taguchi L9 orthogonal array has been employed to ascertain the affect of different input parameters of FDM machine to prepare the functional prototypes in the form of cubical patterns. Instead of using conventional IC, a rapid method has been employed to prepare sacrificial pattern by using siladent powder (which is being used for preparing cast in clinical dentistry for dentures). Further this method has been explored as an alternate route of rapid IC, which requires very less time as compared to the traditional methods.

ALIGNED VIRGIN AND RECYCLED SHORT CARBON FIBRE HYBRID COMPOSITES	20TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPOSITE MATERIALS			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Conference on Composite Materials (ICCM)	JUL 19-24, 2015	Copenhagen, DENMARK			Recycled composites remanufacturing; Short fibres composites	POLYMER COMPOSITES; ALIGNMENT	One of the main problems in industrial applications of carbon composite materials is recycling end of life products. Usually chopped recycled fibres are randomly dispersed in materials as low-grade additives for non-structural applications; however, in order to maximize economic and functional viability, these fibres should be reused as reinforcement for high performance structural composites. The fibre alignment level is the key factor to increase the fibre volume fraction, and consequently the performance of recycled composites. Another important factor is the impact of the fibre recovery process on the mechanical properties of carbon fibres. Carbon fibres can be damaged during the fibre recovery process leading to a significant loss of strength, but the modulus is almost the same as that of virgin carbon fibres. The aim of this research is to manufacture intermingled hybrid composites using highly aligned new and recycled discontinuous carbon fibres with the HiPerDiF (High Performance Discontinuous Fibres) method to increase the availability of recycled carbon fibres. This method enables manufacturing of discontinuous fibre hybrid composites with different fibre mixing ratios; the constituents are intimately mixed and the hybridisation is achieved within the ply. In this work, the stiffness and the failure properties of aligned short fibre composites, as a function of the recycled to virgin carbon fibres ratio, are investigated. The HiPerDiF method proved to be a valuable remanufacturing method to achieve high performance short fibre composite from end of life recycled composites.

Special emphasis is placed on the development of materials that would be cheaper, from natural sources, without releases of harmful substances during the manufacturing process and usage, with the possibility of using waste materials and recycling after service life. Wood or wood residues are one of the potential raw materials that could be used for 3D printing in combination with natural and synthetic polymers. It is anticipated that with the development of additive technologies, the use of wood-plastic composites will also expand to the area of structural elements, for example, in the construction of prefabricated houses. The fire behaviour of 3D printed wood/PLA specimens was determined according to ASTM E 2058 standard and microscale combustion calorimetry (MCC) with ASTM 7309-13.

New circular strategies based on 3D printing technologies are emerging as potential solutions although 3D-printed products made of recycled composites may require post-processing. Metallization represents a viable way to foster their exploitation for new applications. This paper shows the use of physical vapor deposition sputtering for the metallization of recycled glass fiber-reinforced polymers processed by UV-assisted 3D printing. Different batches of 3D-printed samples were produced, post-processed, and coated with a chromium metallization layer to compare the results before and after the metallization process and to evaluate the quality of the finishing from a qualitative and quantitative point of view. The analysis was conducted by measuring the surface gloss and roughness, analyzing the coating morphology and thickness through the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the cross-sections, and assessing its adhesion with cross-cut tests. The metallization was successfully performed on the different 3D-printed samples, achieving a good homogeneity of the coating surface. Despite the influence of the staircase effect, these results may foster the investigation of new fields of application, as well as the use of different polymer-based composites from end-of-life products, i.e., carbon fiber-reinforced polymers.

The novel polybenzoxazine can be recycled, reshaped and (re)processed, thanks to a fast relaxation process (18 seconds at 120 degrees C) and low activation energy (64.5 kJ mol(-1)). Furthermore, the benzoxazine vitrimer shows significant and healable adhesive properties over short times and at low temperatures.

Total nine composite filaments were prepared by taking 90% ABS and 10% Fe powder by weight. The maximum peak strength (32.82 MPa) of ABS + Fe based composite filament was observed at 15 kg (load), 225 degrees C (extrusion temperature) and 70 rpm (speed) whereas the maximum %BE (7.13%) was obtained at parametric settings of 10 kg, 245 degrees C and 70 rpm respectively. The observed mechanical and thermal properties of the composite filaments were analysed through porosity analysis, scanning electron microscopy characterization and differential scanning calorimeter.

Food and packaging industry uses the most, the life cycle of which becomes short, they become waste very quick. Also included are light weight bottles of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Large amounts of waste can be handled with multiple options. The worst is their dumping on dump sites, as these materials do not compost. Their thermal recycling is more favorable due to their high calorific value, but a real cycle can only be achieved by their physical recycling. However, during the multiple re-purposing, PET's mechanical and processing properties are reduced. In our research, chemical foaming has been investigated, resulting in a smaller weight, better specific property, and fully reusable product. During our investigations, the structure and mechanical properties of recycled PET (rPET) specimens manufactured with different composition, chain and foam additives were analyzed.	[Szabo, V.

The present results help to confirm a hypothesis that observed strength gains, in cases where the amount of the first additive exceeded the adsorption capacity of the fibers, were due to the formation of polyclectrolyte complexes in the solution phase, followed by their deposition onto fiber surfaces. Complex formation and retention of complexes on fiber surfaces occurred efficiently over a wide range of polymer charge ratios, cationic polymer attributes, and other conditions, regardless of whether the fibers had been pretreated to reverse their net charge.

J	Haussler, M; Eck, M; Rothauer, D; Mecking, S				Haeussler, Manuel; Eck, Marcel; Rothauer, Dario; Mecking, Stefan			Closed-loop recycling of polyethylene-like materials	NATURE			English	Article							CHAIN; POLYOLEFINS; ACIDS; OILS	Plastics are key components of almost any technology today. Although their production consumes substantial feedstock resources, plastics are largely disposed of after their service life. In terms of a circular economy(1-8), reuse of post-consumer sorted polymers ('mechanical recycling') is hampered by deterioration of materials performance(9,10). Chemical recycling(1,11) via depolymerization to monomer offers an alternative that retains high-performance properties. The linear hydrocarbon chains of polyethylene(12) enable crystalline packing and provide excellent materials properties(13). Their inert nature hinders chemical recycling, however, necessitating temperatures above 600 degrees Celsius and recovering ethylene with a yield of less than 10 per cent(3,11,14). Here we show that renewable polycarbonates and polyesters with a low density of in-chain functional groups as break points in a polyethylene chain can be recycled chemically by solvolysis with a recovery rate of more than 96 per cent. At the same time, the break points do not disturb the crystalline polyethylene structure, and the desirable materials properties (like those of high-density polyethylene) are fully retained upon recycling. Processing can be performed by common injection moulding and the materials are well-suited for additive manufacturing, such as 3D printing. Selective removal from model polymer waste streams is possible. In our approach, the initial polymers result from polycondensation of long-chain building blocks, derived by state-of-the-art catalytic schemes from common plant oil feedstocks, or microalgae oils(15). This allows closed-loop recycling of polyethylene-like materials. Polycarbonates and polyesters with materials properties like those of high-density polyethylene can be recycled chemically by depolymerization to their constituent monomers, re-polymerization yielding material with uncompromised processing and materials properties.

Some studies have been reported in recent past on recycling of thermoplastics via three-dimensional (3D) printing as a novel technique under primary and secondary recycling. But hitherto no work has been reported on use of recycled/virgin thermoplastics for use as energy storage devices (ESD). In this paper an effort has been made to develop in house ESD in form of dry cell by printing with low cost fused deposition modeling (FDM) based commercial open source 3D printer. The feed stock filament of FDM has been prepared by twin screw extrusion (TSE) comprising of advanced composite materials (thermoplastic: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) matrix, reinforced with different proportions of chemicals/salts namely: MnO2, ZnCl2, NH4Cl and graphite), which has been used to print dry cell for energy storage applications. The commercial dry cell consists of four zones/sections and feed stock filaments for three zones have been prepared separately on TSE (with different proportions of ABS and reinforcement of chemical/salts) and fourth zone (of Zn metal) has been tasted with conventional sand casting route. Finally, all four zones have been assembled in series to develop fully functional prototype of ESD. This study highlights that with the proposed methodology, dry cell comprising of minimum 40% by weight recycled thermoplastics can be prepared successfully having voltage potential at par with commercial dry cell. Another major advantage of using this novel route is that the ESD prepared is more thermally stable (confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis) and can operate up to 95 degrees C temperature.

Finding Ideal Parameters for Recycled Material Fused Particle Fabrication-Based 3D Printing Using an Open Source Software Implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization	3D PRINTING AND ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article; Early Access						particle swarm optimization; LDPE; waste plastic; recycling; fused particle fabrication	HIGH-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; WASTE POLYMER; 3-D; FILAMENT; FIBER; MACHINE; VIRGIN; LOOP	As additive manufacturing rapidly expands the number of materials including waste plastics and composites, there is an urgent need to reduce the experimental time needed to identify optimized printing parameters for novel materials. Computational intelligence (CI) in general and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms in particular have been shown to accelerate finding optimal printing parameters. Unfortunately, the implementation of CI has been prohibitively complex for noncomputer scientists. To overcome these limitations, this article develops, tests, and validates PSO Experimenter, an easy-to-use open-source platform based around the PSO algorithm and applies it to optimizing recycled materials. Specifically, PSO Experimenter is used to find optimal printing parameters for a relatively unexplored potential distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM) material that is widely available: low-density polyethylene (LDPE). LDPE has been used to make filament, but in this study for the first time it was used in the open source fused particle fabrication/fused granular fabrication system. PSO Experimenter successfully identified functional printing parameters for this challenging-to-print waste plastic. The results indicate that PSO Experimenter can provide 97% reduction in research time for 3D printing parameter optimization. It is concluded that the PSO Experimenter is a user-friendly and effective free software for finding ideal parameters for the burgeoning challenge of DRAM as well as a wide range of other fields and processes.

Their use in applications is somehow limited by short setting time, brittleness and low water resistance; this calls for the use of additives. Two polymer additives were designed adopting emulsion polymerization, an environmentally friendly solution to make available polymers as water-based latex dispersions. The composites containing 5 wt% of polymer, exhibited better elastic behaviour, with up to twice the toughness of the reference sample and of a sample produced with commercial styrene butadiene rubber latex. Moreover, the additives reduced the apparent porosity, promoted phosphate crystallization, modified the size and shape of crystals, and effectively retarded the reaction, extending working time. The acrylic emulsion developing keto-hydrazide self-crosslinking reaction imparted better properties to the composite, thanks to the synergistic effect with the MPC setting reaction.

More specifically, LDPE films for food packaging have been treated with atmosphere corona discharge plasma for electrochemical detection of glucose. Enzyme-functionalized sensors manufactured using such recycled materials, which act as a mediator capable of electrocommunicating with the glucose oxidase (GOx) enzyme, are able to detect glucose concentrations in sweat and are fully compatible with the levels of such bioanalytes in both healthy and diabetic patients. Covalent immobilization of the GOx enzyme on the plasma-treated LDPE films has been successfully performed using the carbodiimide method, as proved by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Then, the electronic communication between the deeply buried active site of the GOx and the reactive excited species formed at the surface of the plasma-treated LDPE has been demonstrated by linear sweep voltammetry. Finally, cyclic voltammetry in artificial sweat has been used to show that the LDPE-functionalized sensor has a linear response in the concentration of range of 50 mu M to 1 mM with a limit of detection of 375 mu A.mu M-1 .cm(-2). Comparison of the performance of sensors prepared using recycled (i.e. with additives) and pristine (i.e. without additives) LDPE indicates that the utilization of the former does not require any pretreatment to eliminate additives. The present strategy demonstrates a facile approach for recycling LDPE waste into a high value-added product, which will potentially pave the way for the treatment of plastic waste in the future. Noninvasive glucose sensors based on recycled LDPE may play a crucial role in monitoring diabetes in underdeveloped regions.

Wind energy industry; E. Mechanical recycling; E. Fused filament fabrication; B. Mechanical properties	COMPOSITES; POLYMERS; TECHNOLOGIES; DESIGN; FDM	The wind energy industry is one of the fastest-growing application sectors of composites, where reinforcement fibers are used in the manufacturing of light rotor blades. Considering the limited lifetime of turbine blades, a growing number of wind turbines will start to be decommissioned. Turbine blades are generally landfilled at their end-of-life, which highly impacts the environment. This paper proposes a systematic scheme combining mechanical recycling and 3D printing to recycle the valuable constituents of the scrap blades and reuse them in a Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) process with the aim of improving the mechanical performance of 3D printed components. Mechanical grinding integrated with a double sieving mechanism is utilized to recover the reinforcement fibers. Tensile test specimens with 5 wt% fiber content are fabricated from the recycled fibers and plastic pellets and their mechanical properties as well as internal microstructure are investigated. The results demonstrate an improvement of 16% and 10% in the elastic modulus and ultimate strength of the reinforced composite filament as compared to the commercially available pure PLA filament. As well, a Young's modulus of 3.35 GPa was observed for the FFF fabricated samples, which is an 8% increase relative to pure PLA samples.

In the polymer field, thermoset resins are a popular choice for a plethora of applications due to their great mechanical properties and thermochemical stability. However, due to their irreversible crosslinked nature, they are hard to be processed using SLS. Herein, a covalently crosslinked polymer thermoset based on thermally reversible Diels-Alder (DA) bonds has been printed using SLS. The thermoreversible network exhibits a glassy behavior due to its high crosslinked density and glass transition temperature and was successfully milled into a suitable particle size, morphology and flow for SLS applications. At low temperatures, the DA equilibrium shifts towards the formation of the DA crosslinks, while at high temperatures the DA adducts gradually dissociate, allowing flow and reprocessability at temperatures above 131C. Furthermore, the printed parts exhibit healing ability when heated above their glass transition temperature, reaching a fracture stress and Young's Modulus of 25.4 MPa and 1416 MPa, respectively. Thus, the dynamic nature of the network extends the build lifetime upon damage and also brings the opportunity of recycling or reprocessing, enhancing circularity compared to classic thermosets.

Although the literature is abundant covering various aspects of this problem it can be what one may describe as a serious "bug" in the progress of many polymer applications and indeed can limit their acceptance in many products. These may be in clear films and bottles, white goods or recycling and post-use where heat and light can discolour polymer materials. The science underpinning the yellowing can be due to the additives, more importantly, the phenolic/amine antioxidants and/or inherent in the polymers themselves especially polyaromatics such as polyesters or polycarbonates, epoxy-amines, and polystyrene to name but a few. In many industrial applications solving or overcoming this issue is not always easy and can be problematic. The chemistry of these processes will be discussed and highlighted and effective modes of stabilisation and/or inhibition presented with often unconventional detailed examples and their structural developments for optimisation of additive performance. Thus, examples of chemical treatment processes to minimise polymer yellowing will also be presented where polyglycols and various chemical reducing agents provide some useful ideas. Hopefully, a clearer understanding of the types of chemistries involved in yellowing and their minimisation will provide a useful way forward for the polymer and additive manufacturers and technologists in unravelling and solving their potential issues and problems at many of the stages of polymer manufacture and processing.

Life cycle analysis of distributed recycling of post-consumer high density polyethylene for 3-D printing filament	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Distributed recycling; Life cycle analysis; Plastic; Polymer; Recycling; Transportation energy	WASTE MANAGEMENT; ASSESSMENT LCA; DEBRIS	The growth of desktop 3-D printers is driving an interest in recycled 3-D printer filament to reduce costs of distributed production. Life cycle analysis studies were performed on the recycling of high density polyethylene into filament suitable for additive layer manufacturing with 3-D printers. The conventional centralized recycling system for high population density and low population density rural locations was compared to the proposed in home, distributed recycling system. This system would involve shredding and then producing filament with an open-source plastic extruder from post-consumer plastics and then printing the extruded filament into usable, value-added parts and products with 3-D printers such as the open-source self replicating rapid prototyper, or RepRap. The embodied energy and carbon dioxide emissions were calculated for high density polyethylene recycling using SimaPro 7.2 and the database Ecolnvent v2.0. The results showed that distributed recycling uses less embodied energy than the best-case scenario used for centralized recycling. For centralized recycling in a low-density population case study involving substantial embodied energy use for transportation and collection these savings for distributed recycling were found to extend to over 80%. If the distributed process is applied to the U.S. high density polyethylene currently recycled, more than 100 million MJ of energy could be conserved per annum along with the concomitant significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. It is concluded that with the open-source 3-D printing network expanding rapidly the potential for widespread adoption of in-home recycling of post-consumer plastic represents a novel path to a future of distributed manufacturing appropriate for both the developed and developing world with lower environmental impacts than the current system.

Photoreversible Covalent Hydrogels for Soft-Matter Additive Manufacturing	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						Coumarin; hydrogel; reversible covalent; soft-matter additive manufacturing	LIQUID BIODEGRADABLE COPOLYMERS; POLYMER NETWORKS; CROSS-LINKING; REVERSIBLE PHOTODIMERIZATION; COUMARIN CHROMOPHORES; RESPONSIVE HYDROGELS; MOLECULAR DESIGN; TEMPERATURE; POLYESTERS; SOLVENT	Reversible covalent chemistry provides access to robust materials with the ability to be degraded and reformed upon exposure to an appropriate stimulus. Photoresponsive units are attractive for this purpose, as the spatial and temporal application of light is easily controlled. Coumarin derivatives undergo a [2 + 2] cycloaddition upon exposure to long-wave UV irradiation (365 nm), and this process can be reversed using short-wave UV light (254 nm). Therefore, polymers cross-linked by coumarin groups are excellent candidates as reversible covalent gels. In this work, copolymerization of coumarin-containing monomers with the hydrophilic comonomer N,N-dimethylacrylamide yielded water-soluble, linear polymers that could be cured with long-wave UV light into free-standing hydrogels, even in the absence of a photoinitiator. Importantly, the gels were reverted back to soluble copolymers upon short-wave UV irradiation. This process could be cycled, allowing for recycling and remolding of the hydrogel into additional shapes. Further, this hydrogel can be imprinted with patterns through a mask-based, post-gelation photoetching method. Traditional limitations of this technique, such as the requirement for uniform etching in one direction, have been overcome by combining these materials with a soft-matter additive manufacturing methodology. In a representative application of this approach, we printed solid structures in which the interior coumarin-cross-linked gel is surrounded by a nondegradable gel. Upon exposure to short-wave UV irradiation, the coumarin-cross-linked gel was reverted to soluble prepolymers that were washed away to yield hollow hydrogel objects.

This black toner is a polymer composite comprised of a styrene-based copolymer, carbon black and other additives. The mechanical properties of toners are specifically designed to allow attrition to 10-20 mu m particles. Thus the bulk mechanical properties are not desirable for load bearing applications typical of consumer plastics. Reactive and non-reactive blending oftener with other polymers have been used to enhance the mechanical properties. The blends and alloys produced exhibit a transition from brittle to ductile behavior as exhibited by impact energy data. Thus a family of polymeric systems of variable properties versus cost compromise can be created.

This study presents water-based robotic fabrication as a design approach and enabling technology for AM of biodegradable hydrogel composites. Our research focuses on the combination of expanding the dimensions of the fabrication envelope, developing structural materials for additive deposition, incorporating material-property gradients, and manufacturing architectural-scale biodegradable systems. This work presents a robotically controlled AM system to produce biodegradable composite objects combining natural hydrogels, such as chitosan and sodium alginate, with other organic aggregates. It demonstrates the approach by designing, building, and evaluating the mechanics and controls of a multichamber extrusion system. Finally, it provides evidence of large-scale composite objects fabricated by our technology that display graded properties and feature sizes ranging from micro-to macroscale. Fabricated objects may be chemically stabilized or dissolved in water and recycled within minutes. Applications include the fabrication of fully recyclable products or temporary architectural components such as tent structures with graded mechanical and optical properties. Proposed applications demonstrate environmental capabilities such as water-storing structures, hydration-induced shape forming, and product disintegration over time.

J	Kim, H; Lee, S				Kim, Hyungjin; Lee, Sangkyu			Printability and physical properties of iron slag powder composites using material extrusion-based 3D printing	JOURNAL OF IRON AND STEEL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Slag; By-product; Mechanical property; 3D printing; Additive manufacturing	STAINLESS-STEEL; MICROSTRUCTURE; NANOCOMPOSITES; POLYMER; MODEL	There have been many studies on three-dimensional (3D) printing using metal compounds. However, 3D printing using a metal compound has disadvantages in that it increases the cost for supplying metal materials. A method of using slag which is a recyclable material has been proposed to reduce costs. With the growing demand for additive manufacturing using by-products, slag has gained attention as a diverse recycling material for 3D printing technologies. A new fabrication approach was analyzed for producing porous bodies via additive manufacturing for blending slag and reinforced metals. However, because of its low quality due to low strength, low durability, and structural defeats, the amount of slag generated is high, and its usability remains uncertain. Also, slag is an excellent material with a huge potential for producing structures with high mechanical properties, and limited research in the area of slag recycling has been conducted due to difficulties in sintering the iron by-products. To develop a recycling approach that utilizes slag in 3D printing powders, a study to increase the industrial usability by mixing slag and ceramic beads was described. A method was presented to compare the physical properties of 3D printed slag parts with the physical properties of those generated by blending iron slag, alumina, and zirconia. In order to find the mixing ratio with the optimum physical properties, the average particle size, bending stress, and maximum compressive stress were tested. The combination ratio to obtain the highest strength was when iron slag powder was 40% and alumina was 60%. In addition, the specimens by composition to which the stress test was applied were cut to analyze the tissue under a microscope. It is thought that cracking in the sintered structure decreases and density increases by mixing alumina and zirconium, contributing to increased strength. When a ceramic bead composed of alumina and zirconium is mixed with slag to form a composite material, a metal compound having a level of physical properties that can be used as a material for 3D printing can be produced. Furthermore, a novel concept of producing lightweight structural materials via additive manufacturing, which entails a fabrication process whereby high-strength metals are stacked inside hollow base steels, was proposed.

Elements of computer monitors were used to prepare re-granulate, which in turn was used to manufacture a filament for fused filament fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing technology. Design/methodology/approach The geometry of test samples (i.e. dumbbell and bar) was obtained in accordance with the PN-EN standards. Samples made with the FFF technology were used to determine selected mechanical properties and to compare the results obtained with the properties of ABS re-granulate mould pieces made with the injection moulding technology. The GATE device manufactured by 3Novatica was used to make the prototypes with the FFF technology. Processing parameters were tested with the use of an Aflow extrusion plastometer manufactured by Zwick/Roell and other original testing facilities. Tests of mechanical properties were performed with a Z030 universal testing machine, a HIT 50P pendulum impact tester and a Z3106 hardness tester manufactured by Zwick/Roell. Findings The paper presents results of tests performed on a filament obtained from the ABS re-granulate and indicates characteristic processing properties of that material. The properties of the new secondary material were compared with the available original ABS materials that are commonly used in the additive technology of manufacturing geometrical objects. The study also presents selected results of tests of functional properties of ABS products made in the FFF technology. Originality/value The test results allowed authors to assess the possibility of a secondary application of used elements of electronic equipment housings in the FFF technology and to compare the strength properties of products obtained with similar products made with the standard injection moulding technology.

The properties of natural fibre reinforced polymer composites are generally governed by the pre-treated process of fibre and the manufacturing process of the composites. These properties can be tailored for various types of applications by properly selecting suitable fibres, matrices, additives and production methods. Besides, due to the complexity of fibre structures, different mechanical performances of the composites are obtained even with the use of the same fibre types with different matrices. Some critical issues like poor wettability, poor bonding and degradation at the fibre/matrix interface (a hydrophilic and hydrophobic effect) and damage of the fibre during the manufacturing process are the main causes of the reduction of the composites' strength.

A comparison of mechanical properties of recycled high-density polyethylene/waste carbon fiber via injection molding and 3D printing	POLYMER COMPOSITES			English	Article						additive manufacturing; injection molding; recycled carbon; recycled thermoplastic; recycling	IN-USE STOCKS; REINFORCED POLYMERS; WASTE FLOWS	Recycled high-density polyethylene (r-HDPE) was combined with waste carbon fiber by loading 6 k, 12 k, and 24 k tows through an extruder to create thermoplastic/carbon pellets with fiber volume fractions of 11.2%, 18.9%, and 29.5%, respectively. Tensile and flexural coupons were subsequently produced via injection molding and novel 3D printing. The addition of carbon into r-HDPE in all cases showed increased mechanical properties. Maximum increases were observed through the inclusion of 29.5% fiber volume fraction. Increases in tensile and flexural modulus of up to 2.9 GPa (+505.9%) and 5.8 GPa (+711.0%) respectively were observed for r-HDPE/carbon fiber (CF) samples. Increases in tensile and flexural strengths of up to 57.9 MPa (+311.8%) and 47.7 MPa (+188.0%) respectively were observed for 29.5% r-HDPE/CF samples. Some variance in mechanical performance between injection molded and 3D printed samples was observed indicating production methodology might influence final material performance.

Recycled poly(lactic acid)-based 3D printed sustainable biocomposites: a comparative study with injection molding	MATERIALS TODAY SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Biodegradable polymers; Microcrystalline cellulose; Recycling; 3D printing; Mechanical properties; Chain extender	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; ACID PLA; POLYMER NANOCOMPOSITES; COMPOSITES; CELLULOSE; IMPACT; CRYSTALLIZATION; POLYLACTIDE; RHEOLOGY	With the objective of giving a new economic life to postindustrial waste poly(lactic acid) (PLA), bio-composites based on recycled PLA were manufactured using conventional melt blending, and the strands produced were successfully used for three-dimensional (3D) printing of American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) samples by means of the fused deposition molding (FDM) method. This article further discusses the processing advantages and challenges associated with void formation, anisotropic behavior, and the quality of the 3D printed (3DP) samples in comparison with injection-molded (IM) counterparts. The blends were manufactured containing 30 wt % of recycled PLA in a matrix of virgin PLA. Similarly, blends were also prepared with addition of an epoxy-based chain extender (CE) and as well as with the CE and a reinforcing phase of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). One of the limitations of recycled PLA in FDM-based 3D printing is its high melt flow due to the reduced molecular weight after recycling, which results in excessive material flow during extrusion, and hence limits its application in FDM-based 3D printing. Consequently, the main effect of the CE, Joncryl, was to control the Melt Flow Index (MFI) of the biocomposites containing the recycled PLA. The addition of CE also resulted in improvement of the impact strength of 3DP samples. In general, the CE in combination with the natural fibers (MCC) allowed the incorporation of postindustrial PLA. Data suggest that more recycled PLA may be incorporated by using this blend combination. In general, owing to the void formation, 3DP samples presented lower values of density (lightweight) and mechanical properties as compared with IM samples. However, the tensile strength, modulus and Izod impact strength of 3DP biocomposites were increased by up to 88%, 127%, and 11%, respectively, by the addition of 5 wt % MCC, as compared with 3DP samples based on postindustrial PLA without additives.

J	Ruiz, LE; Pinho, AC; Resende, DN				Ruiz, Luis E.; Pinho, Ana C.; Resende, David N.			3D Printing as a Disruptive Technology for the Circular Economy of Plastic Components of End-of-Life Vehicles: A Systematic Review	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Review						circular economy; 3D printing; ELV; recycling; vehicles	SUSTAINABILITY; CHALLENGES	The automotive industry is frequently associated with high polluting manufacturing systems, which raise concern owing to the current environmental frame. For this reason, new alternative manufacturing technologies with lower environmental impact have been proposed and tested, such as additive manufacturing (AM). Since AM technologies produce almost no waste, they can represent a huge opportunity for the automotive industry to become greener. In this sense, the object of the present review is to explore the challenges and strategies of 3D printing, recycling, and circular economy in the automotive industry. Therefore, to achieve the aim of the study, a systematic review methodology was used in five stages: (1) defining the targets; (2) extraction of papers from Scopus; (3) text mining and corpora text analysis of relevant documents from the platform; (4) identification of the dominant categories of the research topics; and (5) discussion and control of obtained results and provision of recommendations for future studies. The analysis of 14 relevant articles revealed that 3D printing technology represents an opportunity to empower small-scale producers of polymers, recycle ELV materials, and decentralize the supply chains of plastic articles. The possibility to include plastic parts produced by AM technology has been pointed out as an innovative option for car manufacturers. Unfortunately, till the present day, poor information was found in this regard. Findings highlighted the need for strategies to turn polymeric automotive components into more eco-friendly and safer materials, improve the supply chain of polymers, perform sustainability assessments, and reformulate waste policies for ELVs.

Potential of distributed recycling from hybrid manufacturing of 3-D printing and injection molding of stamp sand and acrylonitrile styrene acrylate waste composite	SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Recycling; Stamp sand; Acrylonitrile styrene acrylate; Composite; Additive manufacturing	BUTADIENE-STYRENE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; POLYMER; FILAMENT; COPPER; COMPONENTS; EFFICIENCY; OUTDOOR; AREA	In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, over 500 million tons of copper rich rock were removed from mines and treated in chemical baths to extract copper. Toxic substances have been seeping into the watersheds from the resultant waste stamp sands. Recent work on developing a circular economy using recycled plastic for distributed manufacturing technologies has proven promising, and this study investigates the potential to use this approach to form stamp sand and acrylonitrile styrene acrylate (ASA) composites. Specifically, this study found the maximum amount of stamp sand that was able to be added to waste ASA by mass with a single auger recyclebot system for compounding was below 40%. The mechanical properties of the composite were evaluated up to 40%, and the addition of stamp sand reduced the material's ultimate tensile strength by about half compared to the strength of raw recycled ASA, regardless of the percent stamp sand in the composite. However, this strength reduction plateaus and the tensile strength of the ASA and stamp sand composites can be compared favorably with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) at any level. This makes waste ASAstamp sand composites potential replacements for outdoor applications of ABS as well as some current ASA applications. These results are promising and call for future work to evaluate the technical, economic and environmental potential for waste ASA stamp sand composites. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Design/methodology/approach - Controlling the polymer degradation requires an understanding of many different phenomena, including the different chemical mechanisms underlying structural changes in polymer macromolecules, the influences of polymer morphology, the complexities of oxidation chemistry and the complex reaction pathways of polymer additives. Several ageing characterization experiments are given. Findings - The paper covers the ageing process analysis of acrylate-based polymers. An overview of the ageing behaviour is given, along with the bandwidth of material characteristics for a prolonged lifetime of this material class. Research limitations/implications - For research and development in the field of rapid prototyping (RP) materials data about ageing behaviour and environmental effects are crucial. The authors show possible methods for measuring these effects and discuss the consequences in material research using a recently developed biocompatible SL resin as an example. Practical implications - The study of the ageing behaviour of polymers is important for understanding their usability, storage, lifetime and recycling. The presented polymeric formulations are able to meet the growing demand for both soft and stiff manufacturing resin materials in the engineering and medical fields. Originality/value - The analysis of the ageing behaviour of polymer materials is an important issue for engineering applications, recycling of post-consumer plastic waste, as well as the use of polymers as biological implants and matrices for drug delivery and the lifetime of an article. The paper gives an overview of details involving ageing behaviour and their meaning for applications of acrylate-based SL resins and is therefore of high importance to people with interest in long-term behaviour and ageing of RP materials.

By adjusting process settings and adding fibers and fillers, composite properties can be improved. Additive manufacturing is popular in the polymer industry because it can manufacture intricately designed parts with fewer defects and greater strength with less material consumption. Composites use thermoplastics and thermosetting polymers. Thermoset plastics cannot be reused or recycled; therefore, they are disposed in landfills, creating pollution and environmental harm. In this work, thermoplastic ASA (Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate) polymer filament is used for FDM 3D printing. The specimens are made by varying five process parameters that affected the materials' mechanical properties. The tensile, flexural and impact specimens are made using MINITAB software and ASTM requirements. The L18 orthogonal array experimental design, specimens and results were optimized. Infill density and layer height were most influential. Maximum tensile strength of 51.86 MPa, flexural strength of 82.56 MPa and impact strength of 0.180 J/mm(2) were obtained by following the software-suggested input factors and compared with the predicted values. Final error percentage was obtained between the predicted and the experimental results and it was found to be under 3%, which is acceptable.

The first step in such manufacturing process is the Sulfur modification using polymeric additives to control sulfur crystallization and to prevent macro-crystals growth. In a controlled temperature surroundings, modified Sulfur was mixed with elemental sulfur, fly ash and desert sand to form the newly SPC. The durability of the SPC was evaluated in: de-ionized water, acidic Solutions of 20, 40, 70, and 98 wt% H(2)SO(4) solutions, and saline Solutions of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 wt% NaCl, at different temperatures for different periods of time. To compare the SPC results with known material, normal Portland cement concrete (PCC) mortars were also studied. The results indicated that the manufactured SPC material has high compressive strength, low hydraulic conductivity, and high resistance to permeation of water, and particularly resistant to corrosion in acid and salt environments.

The raw materials were two commercial degrees of recycled post-consumer waste, i.e., rPP and rPET-O. Sheets were manufactured by a semi-industrial extrusion-calendering process. The mechanical and fracture behaviours of manufactured sheets were analyzed via tensile tests and the essential work of fracture approach. SEM micrographics of cryofractured sheets revelated the development of in situ rPP/rPET-O microfibrillar composites when 30 wt.% of rPET-O was added. It was observed that the yield stress was not affected with the addition of rPET-O. However, the microfibrillar structure increased the Young's modulus by more than a third compared with rPP, fulfilling the longitudinal value predicted by the additive rule of mixtures. Regarding the EWF analysis, the resistance to crack initiation was highly influenced by the resistance to its propagation owing to morphology-related instabilities during tearing. To analyze the initiation stage, a partition energy method was successfully applied by splitting the total work of fracture into two specific energetic contributions, namely initiation and propagation. The results revelated that the specific essential initiation-related work of fracture was mainly affected by rPET-O phase. Remarkably, its value was significantly improved by a factor of three with the microfibrillar structure of rPET-O phase. The results allowed the exploration of the potential ability of manufacturing in situ MFCs without a "precursor" morphology, providing an economical way to promote the recycling rate of PET-O, as this material is being discarded from current recycling processes.

J	Zhou, DL; Huang, H; Wang, Y; Yu, JR; Hu, ZM				Zhou, Danling; Huang, Hong; Wang, Yan; Yu, Junrong; Hu, Zuming			Design and synthesis of an amide-containing crosslinked network based on Diels-Alder chemistry for fully recyclable aramid fabric reinforced composites	COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Polymer-matrix composites (PMCs); Recycling; Mechanical properties; Diels-Alder reaction	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; FIBER COMPOSITES; POLYMERS; KEVLAR; STEP	Fiber reinforced thermoset composites (FRPCs) have received tremendous attention because of their merits of light weight, high modulus and high strength. However, the efficient recycling of the waste during the manufacturing and service life of FRPCs is still great challenge. This paper reports a newly designed dynamic crosslinked network based on Diels-Alder chemistry as matrix for fully recyclable aramid fabric reinforced composites. The DA network shows good thermomechanical properties owing to the incorporated aromatic amide bonds, and the overall performance can be readily tailored by adjusting the ratio of amide-containing component and flexible aliphatic component. The good reversibility of the DA network and highly efficient recovery of mechanical properties of recycled sample are confirmed. With optimized composition, the DA network exhibits good interfacial strength with aramid fiber that is comparable to that of widely used epoxy resin due to the interfacial hydrogen bonds among amide bonds between fiber and matrix. Moreover, the closed-loop recycling of both matrix and reinforced fabric without any other additive is also demonstrated. This paper presents the first report on recyclable aramid fiber reinforced composites and is expected to provide hints for future development of fully recyclable and high-performance FRPCs.

J	Blanco, I; Siracusa, V				Blanco, Ignazio; Siracusa, Valentina			The Use of Thermal Techniques in the Characterization of Bio-Sourced Polymers	MATERIALS			English	Review						bio-polymers; thermal behaviour; recycling; thermal properties; sustainability		The public pressure about the problems derived from the environmental issues increasingly pushes the research areas, of both industrial and academic sectors, to design material architectures with more and more foundations and reinforcements derived from renewable sources. In these efforts, researchers make extensive and profound use of thermal analysis. Among the different techniques available, thermal analysis offers, in addition to high accuracy in the measurement, smartness of execution, allowing to obtain with a very limited quantity of material precious information regarding the property-structure correlation, essential not only in the production process, but overall, in the design one. Thus, techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), differential thermal analysis (DTA), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were, are, and will be used in this transition from fossil feedstock to renewable ones, and in the development on new manufacturing processes such as those of additive manufacturing (AM). In this review, we report the state of the art of the last two years, as regards the use of thermal techniques in biopolymer design, polymer recycling, and the preparation of recyclable polymers as well as potential tools for biopolymer design in AM. For each study, we highlight how the most known thermal parameters, namely glass transition temperature (T-g), melting temperature (T-f), crystallization temperature (T-c) and percentage (%c), initial decomposition temperature (T-i), temperature at maximum mass loss rate (T-m), and tan delta, helped the researchers in understanding the characteristics of the investigated materials and the right way to the best design and preparation.

J	Rahimi, M; Esfahanian, M; Moradi, M				Rahimi, Mohammad; Esfahanian, Mohsen; Moradi, Mehran			Effect of reprocessing on shrinkage and mechanical properties of ABS and investigating the proper blend of virgin and recycled ABS in injection molding	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Injection molding; ABS; Recycling; Shrinkage; Mechanical properties; Blend	ACRYLONITRILE-BUTADIENE-STYRENE	In this research, the effect of reprocessing of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) on the mechanical properties of the polymer was studied through a five-stage reprocessing. To this end, the injection mold of the standard samples was manufactured. Then, using an injection molding machine, all of the virgin material was processed. After sampling, the rest of the parts were ground and then reprocessed under the same conditions. In order to get a proper combinational ratio of virgin and recycled ABS with respect to shrinkage and mechanical properties, another experiment was designed. In order to do this, virgin material was blended with 20%, 35% and 50% of the recycled material. The blends were reprocessed and samples were obtained. Impact, tensile, flexural and shrinkage tests, selected from ASTM standard, were used to investigate the mechanical properties of the polymer as well as its shrinkage. Furthermore, viscosity test was used to investigate the changes in the structure of the polymer. As the reprocessing cycles increased, shrinkage decreased and tensile and flexural ultimate strengths increased, more in flexural strength than in tensile. While Young's modulus slightly increased, viscosity decreased and consequently molecular weight decreased too. The proper blend for the least shrinkage was 50% whereas the best mechanical properties were achievable by the 20% blend. The obtained results suggest that reprocessing causes polymer degradation which is a result of the break in the bonds of poly butadiene. Moreover, it can be concluded that reprocessing in ABS can lead to the loss of effectiveness of some additives. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The ease of removal and greater sustainability of organocatalysts relative to transition-metal-based ones has spurred development in specialty applications, e.g., medical devices, drug delivery, optoelectronics. Despite this, the use of organocatalysis and other organomediated reactions in polymer chemistry is still rapidly developing, and we envisage their rapidly growing application in nascent areas such as controlled radical polymerization, additive manufacturing, and chemical recycling in the coming years. In this Review, we describe ten trending areas where we anticipate paradigm shifts resulting from novel organocatalysts and other transition-metal-free conditions. We highlight opportunities and challenges and detail how new discoveries could lead to previously inaccessible functional materials and a potentially circular plastics economy.

J	Ishfaq, K; Asad, M; Mahmood, MA; Abdullah, M; Pruncu, C				Ishfaq, Kashif; Asad, Muhammad; Mahmood, Muhammad Arif; Abdullah, Mirza; Pruncu, Catalin			Opportunities and challenges in additive manufacturing used in space sector: a comprehensive review	RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL			English	Review						Sustainability; Additive manufacturing; 3D printing; Implementation barriers; NASA; Spacecraft	CONFIGURATION; FUTURE; PHYSICS	Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore the applications of 3D printing in space sectors. The authors have highlighted the potential research gap that can be explored in the current field of study. Three-dimensional (3D) printing is an additive manufacturing technique that uses metallic powder, ceramic or polymers to build simple/complex parts. The parts produced possess good strength, low weight and excellent mechanical properties and are cost-effective. Therefore, efforts have been made to make the adoption of 3D printing successful in space so that complex parts can be manufactured in space. This saves a considerable amount of both time and carrying cost. Thereof the challenges and opportunities that the space sector holds for additive manufacturing is worth reviewing to provide a better insight into further developments and prospects for this technology. Design/methodology/approach The potentiality of 3D printing for the manufacturing of various components under space conditions has been explained. Here, the authors have reviewed the details of manufactured parts used for zero-gravity missions, subjected to onboard international space station conditions and with those manufactured on earth. Followed by the major opportunities in 3D printing in space which include component repair, material characterization, process improvement and process development along with the new designs. The challenges like space conditions, availability of power in space, the infrastructure requirements and the quality control or testing of the items that are being built in space are explained along with their possible mitigation strategies. Findings These components are well comparable with those prepared on earth which enables a massive cost saving. Other than the onboard manufacturing process, numerous other components as well as a complete robot/satellite for outer space applications were manufactured by additive manufacturing. Moreover, these components can be recycled onboard to produce feedstock for the next materials. The parts produced in space are bought back and compared with those built on earth. There is a difference in their nature, i.e. the flight specimen showed a brittle nature, and the ground specimen showed a denser nature. Originality/value This review discusses the advancements of 3D printing in space and provides numerous examples of the applications of 3D printing in space and space applications. This paper is solely dedicated to 3D printing in space. It provides a breakthrough in the literature as a limited amount of literature is available on this topic. This paper aims at highlighting all the challenges that additive manufacturing faces in the space sector and also the future opportunities that await development.

To get deeper insights into its causes, this study aimed at characterizing the odor of post-consumer and recycled automotive polypropylene with different contents of talc and an anti-fogging additive. Samples were evaluated by different sensory methods currently applied by the automotive industry (GMW 3205 and VDA 270), which confirmed, that they are not feasible for reuse in interior automotive applications. As these odor evaluations are usually performed by non-trained panelists and do not allow a detailed description of the samples' single odor qualities, sensory evaluation according to ISO 13299 was performed by trained panelists. Samples showed medium-high odor intensities rated from 5.1 to 5.6, and a general dislike of the odor with hedonic ratings from 1.8 to 2.6 (scale 0-10). Their odor profiles correlated well with the odorants identified by chemo-analytical characterization using gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) and two-dimensional GC-O coupled with mass spectrometry (2D-GC-MS/O). An array of odorants with benzene and phenolic structures were identified as potential contributors to the samples' overall smell and are likely to originate from degradation of additives commonly used in automotive components. While the addition of talc or anti-fogging additive did not significantly improve the odor of the samples, the description of the samples' smell and the identification of odor-active compounds related to it allow the development of avoidance strategies for the manufacturing of neutral smelling products intended for vehicles' interior applications.

Incorporating Textile-Derived Cellulose Fibers for the Strengthening of Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate for 3D Printing Feedstock Materials	JOURNAL OF POLYMERS AND THE ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Fused deposition modeling; Plant fiber reinforcement; Additive manufacturing; Plastic recycling; Textile recycling	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; NATURAL FIBER; COMPOSITES; POLYPROPYLENE; IMPACT; ETHICS	Unprecedented levels of production and consumption has led to solid waste accumulation in landfills and oceans. Two significant landfill constituents are textile waste and discarded plastic bottles. Since there is a finite amount of space available for landfill use, solutions that reuse these post-consumer products are imperative. The work presented here is a methodology for producing natural fiber-reinforced polymer composites (NFRPCs) from pseudo-raw materials. Post-consumer textile waste and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) water bottles were made compatible by way of surface modifications. Melt compounding was used to form a monofilament feedstock for extrusion-based 3D printing platforms. Hydrolysis and functionalization of cellulose fibers from white denim cloth was performed. It was found that adding recycled textile fibers to the recycled PET matrix had a toughening effect. Materials characterization involving dynamic mechanical analysis, attenuated total reflectance, impact testing, melt flow index, and scanning electron microscopy were carried out to verify the efficacy of the functionalization process and to ascertain the robustness of the filler/matrix interface. The outcome is a demonstration of a feasible method for the repurposing of waste products for 3D printing applications.

With the two-step extrusion method, dicumyl peroxide (DCP) can completely react after reactive extrusion without adding antioxidants in the first step, which increased the degree of cross-linking and the molecular weight of the recycled HDPE. Then, adding the antioxidant in the second extrusion step can avoid the conflict between the two additives. As a result, this method improved the oxidation induction time (OIT) and the environmental stress cracking resistance (ESCR) value of HOPE compared with the traditional one-step extrusion method. For both Irganox 1035 and Irganox 300, the OIT using the two-step extrusion method is much higher than that using the one-step method. In addition, introducing carbon black (CB) into the black masterbatch affected the OIT. When the CB content was 0.8%, the OIT was at its maximum value.

In order to lead this advanced manufacturing technique toward cleaner production and to save costs, this study addresses the ability to remanufacture a wide range of commercially available filaments. Most of them either tend to degrade by chain scission or crosslinking. Only polypropylene (PP)-based filaments appear to be particularly thermally stable and therefore suitable for multiple remanufacturing sequences. As the extrusion step exerts the largest influence on the material in terms of temperature and shear load, this study focused on the morphological, rheological, thermal, processing, tensile, and impact properties of a promising PP composite in the course of multiple consecutive extrusions as well as the impact of additional heat stabilizers. Even after 15 consecutive filament extrusions, the stabilized additively manufactured PP composite revealed an unaltered morphology and therefore the same tensile and impact strength as the initial material. As the viscosity of the material of the 15th extrusion was nearly identical to that of the 1st extrusion sequence, the processability both in terms of extrusion and FFF was outstanding, despite the tremendous amount of shear and thermal stress that was undergone. The present work provides key insights into one possible step toward more sustainable production through FFF.

Hollow fly-ash cenospheres were blended by 40 wt.% in a HDPE matrix to produce syntactic foam (HDPE40) filaments. Further, the recycling potential was studied by pelletizing the filaments again to extrude twice (2x) and three times (3x). The filaments were tensile tested at 10(-4) s(-1), 10(-3) s(-1), and 10(-2) s(-1) strain rates. HDPE40 filaments show an increasing trend in modulus and strength with the strain rate. Higher density and modulus were noticed for 2x filaments compared to 1x filaments because of the crushing of some cenospheres in the extrusion cycle. However, 2x and 3x filament densities are nearly the same, showing potential for recycling them. The filaments show better properties than the same materials processed by conventional injection molding. Micro-CT scans show a uniform dispersion of cenospheres in all filaments.

PLAP materials have been thermally disengaged at 550 degrees C for 20 min in an argon gas created inert atmosphere to recycle into solid Al and graphitic carbon. In a different route, in the presence of gaseous N-2 at 600 degrees C for 1h, the PLAP materials are degraded into bio-oil. A new technique to produce powdered materials from the ductile metal (Al) has been introduced in this study. In this technique, recycled Al and C from the first route at 550 degrees C, undergoes mechanical milling at cryogenic temperature (-196 degrees C) created by liquid N-2. The translatory high energy ball milling process varied for 2, 4, 6, and 8 cycles (time: 17, 29, 41, and 53 min respectively). As the milling process is extensively high impact loaded at a very low temperature, the foil-like Al recycled from the packaging waste transforms into smaller particles within a very short time (20 min). Upon further milling (41 min), the microparticles (particle size below 100 mu m) of Al can be observed. The microparticles received from the cryo-mill are characterized to investigate the particle size, morphology, crystallographic structure, thermal behavior, chemical state, and dispersibility in different liquid media. Flake shaped, and microsized carbonaceous Al microparticles are contamination-free and thermally stable and can be useful in the fields of additive manufacturing. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

To this end, a commercial polylactide acid (PLA)-based filament derived from waste production of bio-bags is herein considered. For reference, a filament using virgin PLA and one using a wood-based biocomposite were characterized as well. Preliminary testing involved infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The effect of printing parameters (namely bed temperature, layer thickness, top surface layers, retraction speed, and distance) on the final aesthetics of 3D printed parts was verified. The results allow us to attest that the thermal properties of recycled polymer are comparable to those of virgin PLA and biocomposite. In the case of recycled polymer, after the extrusion temperature, bed temperature, and printing speed are estabilished the lowest allowable layer thickness and an appropriate choice of retraction movements are required in order to realize 3D-printed objects without morphological defects visible to the naked eyes. In the case of wood biocomposite, the printing process was complicated by frequent obstructions, and in none of the operating conditions was it possible to obtain an aesthetically satisfying piece of the chosen geometry (Lego-type bricks) Finally, mechanical testing on the 3D printed parts of each system showed that the recycled PLA behaves similarly to virgin and wood/PLA filaments.

J	Josupeit, S; Schmid, HJ				Josupeit, Stefan; Schmid, Hans-Joachim			Experimental analysis and modeling of local ageing effects during laser sintering of polyamide 12 in regard to individual thermal histories	JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE			English	Article						ageing; degradation; polyamide; polycondensation	POWDERS; BEHAVIOR	Polymer laser sintering (LS) is an important additive manufacturing (AM) technology. Individual and complex parts are directly produced from CAD data without the need of specific tools. The raw material is a polymer powder, which is deposited layerwise and melted selectively with a laser. Built parts are embedded in residual unmolten powder, the so-called part cake, which undergoes thermal ageing effects due to the exposure to high temperatures for long times during the manufacturing process. Hence, the recyclability of the unmolten powder is limited. This article focuses on a fundamental analysis of the ageing kinetics dependent on time, temperature, and oxygen content in the gas atmosphere. A model is developed and applied to measured, position-dependent process temperature histories to successfully predict the ageing distribution within a part cake. The results can be used to optimize the thermal process management in LS and to develop new efficient powder recycling methods. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2017, 134, 45435.

However, additive manufacturing of PP by means of fused filament fabrication (FFF), also known as fused deposition modeling, suffers from several drawbacks like high shrinkage, massive warpage, and poor adhesion to common build plates. Herein, we overcome these problems by exploiting glass fiber-reinforced nanophase-separated PP reactor blends (Catalloy process resins). Catalloy is a polymerization process to create PP reactor blends containing dispersed ethylene/1-olefin copolymer rubber nanophases. A warpage quantification method confirms that 3D-printed Catalloy-based PP composites exhibit exceptionally low warpage and successfully compete with amorphous thermoplastics like acrylonitrile-butadiene styrene in printability, build plate adhesion, and printing precision. Microscopic imaging and the measurement of mechanical properties along and perpendicular to the 3D printing direction verify the rapid, highly efficient fusion of the deposited polymer strands. The resulting mechanical properties are very similar to those of injection-molded Catalloy-based composites even at high printing speeds. As evidenced by micro-computer tomography imaging, an unprecedented FFF process-mediated tuning of the fiber orientation is achieved. This allows for precisely tailoring both unidirectional and tuned multidirectional composites via computer design.

Hence, the use of agricultural waste and recycled plastics is an eco-friendly and economic outlook for developing eco-designed products. Moreover, new alternatives to reinforce recycled polyolefins and add value to agroindustrial byproducts are emerging to develop processable materials with reliable performance for industrial applications. In this study, post-consumer recycled high-density polyethylene (rHDPE) and ground rice husk (RH) of 20% w/w were blended in a torque rheometer with or without the following coupling agents: (i) maleic anhydride grafted polymer (MAEO) 5% w/w, (ii) neoalkoxy titanate (NAT) 1.5% w/w, and (iii) ethylene-glycidyl methacrylate copolymer (EGMA) 5% w/w. In terms of processability, the addition of RH decreased the specific energy consumption in the torque experiments with or without additives compared to neat rHDPE. Furthermore, the time to reach thermal stability in the extrusion process was improved with EGMA and MAEO compatibilizers. Tensile and impact test results showed that using coupling agents enhanced the properties of the RH composites. On the other hand, thermal properties analyzed through differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis showed no significant variation for all composites. The morphology of the tensile fracture surfaces was observed via scanning electron microscopy. The results show that these recycled composites are feasible for manufacturing products when an appropriate compatibilizer is used.

Layer upon layer, the polymeric particles are selectively impregnated with two different inks and then fused and consolidated by an infrared (IR) lamp. Much faster than other AM techniques for polymers, MJF has shown exciting potentialities. However, little is known about the consolidation mechanisms acting in MJF and about the effect on the properties of the finished parts of the quality of the materials, powder and inks, and of the printing conditions. The present contribution investigates these issues. The study also compares virgin PA12 powder with pure PA12, recycled PA12 for MJF and PA12 for in selective laser sintering (SLS). The powders showed slight differences. The two inks have the same composition, except for the presence of graphitic carbon. Tensile tests showed that the printed parts are isotropic. However, the deformation at break is affected by building direction of the sample. Occasionally, poor inter-layer adhesion is observed and the tensile strength and the deformation at break collapse. Printed tensile specimens are found to be representative of the material behaviour of a printed component, apart from the deformation at break which is systematically overestimated.

Thermomechanical investigations of SiC and Al2O3-reinforced HDPE	JOURNAL OF THERMOPLASTIC COMPOSITE MATERIALS			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; recycled polymer; high-density polyethylene; fused deposition modeling; rapid tooling; thermomechanical	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; WASTE; LDPE	This research work highlights the thermomechanical investigations of silicon carbide (SiC) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3)-reinforced high-density polyethylene (HDPE)-based feed stock filament of commercial fused deposition modeling (FDM) setup. The recycled HDPE waste was collected (from domestic waste) and washed with water jet for removal of contamination in the first stage. After contamination removal, rheological and thermal behavior (melt flow index, melting temperature, decomposition and enthalpy, etc.) of the unreinforced and reinforced polymer matrix was observed. The SiC and Al2O3 reinforcements in the HDPE matrix have been controlled by twin-screw extrusion process, followed by its processing on single-screw extrusion for preparation of FDM feed stock filament. The feed stock filament prepared by single-screw extruder was subjected to tensile test for mechanical properties (such as peak strength, peak load, and Young's modulus). After ascertaining mechanical properties, multifactor optimization has been performed. Finally, scanning electron micrographs were obtained to understand the distribution of ceramic particles. This study highlights the detailed procedure for managing the polymer waste with improved mechanical properties by considering multifactor optimization. This will enhance the sustainability and also helps to develop low-cost, in-house FDM filament for possible applications as rapid tooling.	[Singh, Narinder; Ahuja, I. P.

To assist the technical evolution of these systems, this study provided the details of an invention for a low-cost, easily replicable open-source grinding machine for compression screw manufacturing. The system itself can be largely fabricated using FPF/FGF following the self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) methodology. This grinding machine can be made from a cordless cut-off grinder and < $155 in parts. The new invention is demonstrated to be able to cut custom screws with variable (i) channel depths, (ii) screw diameters, (iii) screw lengths, (iv) pitches, (v) abrasive disk thicknesses, (vi) handedness of the screws, (vii) and materials (three types of steel tested: 1045 steel, 1144 steel, and 416 stainless steel). The results show that the device is more than capable of replicating commercial screws as well as providing makers with a much greater flexibility to make custom screws. This invention enables the DRAM toolchain to become even more self-sufficient, which assists the goals of the circular economy.

Recycled and virgin LDPE as rheology modifiers of lithium lubricating greases: A comparative study	POLYMER ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE			English	Article							LOW-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE; FILM THICKNESS; BEHAVIOR; FLOW; MICROSTRUCTURE; FORMULATIONS; STABILITY; PLASTICS	In this work, a new application for recycled low-density polyethylene (LDPE), as rheology modifier of standard lithium lubricating grease formulations, was studied. The effectiveness of this additive was compared with that achieved with a virgin LDPE. With this aim, both types of polymers were added to the formulation during the manufacturing process of greases, following the same standard protocol, to reinforce the role of the thickening agent, the lithium 12-hidroxystearate. The effect that both lithium soap and LDPE concentrations exert on the rheology of lubricating grease formulations and its relationship with grease microstructure were discussed. Lubricating greases were rheologically characterized through small-amplitude oscillatory shear and viscous flow measurements. In addition to these, scanning electron microscopy observations and mechanical stability tests were also carried out. In all cases, an increase in soap concentration yields higher values of apparent viscosity and linear viscoelasticity functions. On the other hand, the values of the rheological functions obtained for recycled LDPE-based lubricating greases are, in general, higher than those obtained for virgin LDPE-based grease formulations. However, the structural skeleton developed in greases containing recycled LOPE demonstrates less resistance to severe working conditions, showing lower mechanical stability than virgin LDPE-based grease formulations.

In order to unlock the potentials of 3D printing beyond prototyping purposes, continuous fiber-embedded fused filament fabrication (FFF) as a process for composite production has gained importance. This study focuses on the potential use of recycled, glycol-modified poly(ethylene terephthalate) (rPETG) as a matrix material in continuous fiber additive manufacturing of composites. First, the characteristics of rPETG were compared with those of non-recycled PETG in terms of molecular weight as well as rheological, thermal, and mechanical properties. Then, rPETG and PETG composites containing 25% continuous carbon filament (CCF) fibers (CCFs) were printed using a co-extrusion-type FFF printer. Their tensile and flexural properties were characterized. It was found that the tensile properties of rPETG-based composites were lower than those of PET-based composites, but their flexural properties were nearly the same. The thermodynamic work of adhesion approach was applied to understand the interfacial interactions between the matrix and CFF. It was found that the thermodynamic adhesion between rPETG/CFF was higher than that of PETG/CFF. Additionally, SEM-SE images obtained from the fracture surfaces of the samples supported the findings by showing that the adhesion between rPETG and CF was superior to that between PETG and CF. Thus, this study demonstrated that recycled PETG can be used as a possible matrix material for 3D-printed CCF composites, thus highlighting the ability of recycled plastics to be converted into circular products with high added value.

Polymeric composite materials have the base matrix of polymers containing the reinforcement fillers and additives. They have a wide array of applications ranging from packaging, spacecrafts, smart or specialized polymers to nano based textile material and biological implants. Different polymers used as matrix material to prepare composites with improved mechanical, thermal and electrical properties includes plastics of different constitution like polyester, polyamide etc. Growing public concern about environmental pollution has led to development and design of biodegradable composite materials. Knowledge and implementation of relevant regulatory guidelines are vital from safety and environmental viewpoint. New methods are being devised for polymerization using super critical CO2 along with additives. They have potential market applications along with the elimination of toxic moieties generated in conventional manufacturing techniques. Green chemistry concepts may be utilized for eco-friendly materials and to minimize the toxic implications of organic chemicals such as toluene, methylene chloride which pose potential risks to human health. The holistic and concerted efforts are needed for the development of new composites for minimization of environmental impact of polymer composite production. The life cycle assessment is of paramount importance at every stage of a product's life from initial synthesis to final disposal for a sustainable environment. The regulatory assessment and monitoring procedures as per the National/International guidelines are required to be reviewed wherever needed. They must be updated periodically depending upon the composition, intended usage conditions in order to promote clean processing, applications, biodegradation, recycling and reprocessing.	[Sharma, V.

Polyamide 12 is the most commonly and successfully used polymer powders to date in SLS due to the conforming thermal behaviors of this thermoplastic polymer. State of the art technology produces a substantial amount of un-sintered powders after the manufacturing process. Failure to recycle and reuse these aged powders not only leads to economic losses but also is environmentally unfriendly. This is particularly problematic for powders close to the heat-affected zones that go through severe thermal degradations during the laser sintering processes. Limited procedures exist for systematically reusing such extremely aged powders. This work proposes a new process control method to maximize reusability of aged and extremely aged polyamide 12 powders. Building on a previously untapped interlayer heating, preprocessing, and mixing of powder materials, we show how reclaimed polyamide 12 powders can be consistently reprinted into functional samples, with mechanical properties even superior to current industrial norms. In particular, the proposed method can yield printed samples with 18.04 % higher tensile strength and 55.29 % larger elongation at break using as much as 30 % of extremely aged powders compared to the benchmark sample.

Highly Recyclable, Mechanically Isotropic and Healable 3D-Printed Elastomers via Polyurea Vitrimers	ACS MATERIALS LETTERS			English	Article							FRACTURE-RESISTANCE; INTERLAYER ADHESION; STRAIN-RATE; 3D; ADDITIVES; IMPROVE; PARTS; MELT; TG	Delamination of three-dimensional (3D) printed polymer materials by fused deposition modeling (FDM) is a long-standing challenge in additive manufacturing (AM). With numerous efforts devoted to modification of commercially available thermoplastic FDM filaments, developing printing polymeric materials with new chemical design that could intrinsically improve interlayer adhesion, especially combined with other benefits, is in high demand. Herein, we developed a polyurea vitrimer with heat-driven malleability, which is printed to different 3D geometries using FDM. Significantly improved interlayer adhesion was observed by post-annealing the printed samples close to its topology-freezing transition temperature upon which fast associative dynamic covalent bonds exchange reaction occurs. Isotropic mechanical properties were achieved as demonstrated with printed tensile samples with different infill directions. The printed materials could be fully recycled for five generations with retained mechanical properties. Furthermore, the mechanical performance of the printed sample could also be repaired after damage.

The additive confined on the fabric surface allowed it to be reactive in the heating stage of the composite production right at the interface between fibres and matrix. The resulting composites were tensile tested comparing the data with the neat matrices and the composites with untreated fabric. A discussion to explain the mechanical results taking in consideration the density, porosity and crystallinity as well as exploiting some micro-mechanical models is presented. The ability of the additive to increase the adhesion between cotton and both matrices is verified and is essential to lighten the structures and to reach application requirements.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from plastics are rising and increasingly consuming the global "carbon budget". It is, hence, paramount to implement an effective strategy to reclaim postconsumer plastic as feedstock for technologically innovative materials. Credible opportunity is offered by advances in materials chemistry and catalysis. Here, we demonstrate that by dynamically crosslinking thermoplastic polyolefins, commodity plastics can be upcycled into technically superior and economically competitive materials. A broadly applicable crosslinking strategy has been applied to polymers containing solely carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds, initially by maleic anhydride functionalization, followed by epoxy-anhydride curing. These dynamic networks show a distinct rubber modulus above the melting transition. We demonstrate that sustainability and performance do not have to be mutually exclusive. The dynamic network can be extruded into a continuous filament to be in three-dimensional (3D) printing of complex objects, which retain the mechanical integrity of vitrimers. Being covalently crosslinked, these networks show a thermally triggered shape-memory response, with 90% recovery of a programmed shape. This study opens up the possibility of reclaiming recycled thermoplastics by imparting performance, sustainability, and technological advances to the reprocessed plastic.

J	Lin, CC				Lin, CC			Recycling technology of poly(ethylene terephthalate) materials	MACROMOLECULAR SYMPOSIA			English	Article								Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has become one of major post consumer plastics wastes, in addition to polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC). The challenge to large-volume plastics companies is to team how to collect, separate, reprocess and market their low-cost products and make a profit, too. The effort of. PET recycling, however, is the most successful story in the plastic recycling technology, including both reclaim and upgrade of PET waste. Beverage bottles made of PET are recycled more than 20 % of the total production. The technology of today can reclaim the postconsumer PET bottles to produce high-quality granulated PET with better than 99 % purity. A practical reclaim process for recycling PET bottles (including bottle, HDPE base cup, aluminum cap, liner, label and adhesive) is available by the Center for Plastics Recycling Research in USA. PET recycling process, like for other plastics, can be divided into three categories: incineration, physical recycling, and chemical recycling. To make the plastic recycling business pay requires more than simple recovery and marketing. Greatest profit potential is in upgraded and value-added reclaim products. Upgrading involves compounding with additives to make material more processable, adding reinforcement, or producing extrusions or finished parts from reclaim resins. For instance, a modified injection-moldable resin made from PET bottle scrap is claimed to provide high impact and processability at less cost than competitive materials. It is foreseen that chemical recycling of waste PET bottle becomes feasible if the price of raw material goes up. Three economical processes are involved in this technology: pyrolysis, hydrocracking, and hydrolysis. The hydrolysis process is presently employed to recover the raw material for unsaturated polyester resin manufacture or polyols for the production of polyurethane resin. It is reported in this presentation that polymer concrete could be a huge potential market for chemical reclaim of PET materials, especially for green or mixed-color PET, which are priced lower than colorless PET reclaim materials.

They made of polymer binders (thermosets) such as epoxy, silicone and polyurethane incorporated with metallic or conductive fillers, such as silver, copper, nickel, gold, etc., offered mechanical strength with improved thermal conductivity. Due to their unique properties, such as high specific strength and stiffness with relatively low weight, high corrosion resistance and controllable conductivity, metal filled thermoset composites have been used in various industries including electrical and electronic, medical, aircraft and automotive industry. Unfortunately, filler-matrix adhesion, filler dispersion and high material and manufacturing costs caused the implementation of these materials more challenging. Additives such as coupling agents were introduced to improve the performances of metal filled thermoset composites. This review paper covers the fundamentals of thermoset polymer properties, processing method of metal powder, the preparation and characterization of metal filled thermoset composites from previous studies and the advantages and disadvantages of these materials in various industries.

During FFF 3-D printing, thermal degradation of the polymer releases small particles and chemicals, many of which are hazardous to human health. In this study, particle and chemical emissions from 10 different filaments made from virgin (never printed) and recycled polymers were used to print the same object at the polymer manufacturer's recommended nozzle temperature ("normal") and at a temperature higher than recommended ("hot") to simulate the real-world scenarios of a person intentionally or unknowingly printing on a machine with a changed setting. Emissions were evaluated in a college teaching laboratory using standard sampling and analytical methods. From mobility sizer measurements, particle number-based emission rates were 81 times higher; the proportion of ultrafine particles (diameter <100 nm) were 4% higher, and median particle sizes were a factor of 2 smaller for hot-temperature prints compared with normal-temperature prints (all p-values <0.05). There was no difference in emission characteristics between recycled and virgin acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and polylactic acid polymer filaments. Reducing contaminant release from FFF 3-D printers in educational settings can be achieved using the hierarchy of controls: (1) elimination/substitution (e.g., training students on principles of prevention-through-design, limiting the use of higher emitting polymer when possible); (2) engineering controls (e.g., using local exhaust ventilation to directly remove contaminants at the printer or isolating the printer from students); (3) administrative controls such as password protecting printer settings and establishing and enforcing adherence to a standard operating procedure based on a proper risk assessment for the setup and use (e.g., limiting the use of temperatures higher than those specified for the filaments used); and (4) maintenance of printers.

Plastic waste originating from EEE (WEEE) is a challenge for recycling due to presence of various hazardous elements (i.e. additives) representing a polluting source for the environment and a risk factor for the human health. Among these, there are those containing brominated flame retardants (BFRs), largely utilized to increase fire resistance, avoiding or delaying the flames, thus allowing to the plastics-based-manufactured-products to respect safety requirements. However, plastics with high BFRs levels cannot be recycled and therefore must be removed from the recycling stream. In a circular economy perspective, it is thus necessary to develop a system able to efficiently separate plastic waste into homogeneous fractions based on the BFRs content. To improve the circularity of plastics, it is thus essential to recover and recycle bromine-free plastics to avoid the loss of available secondary raw materials. The aim of this study was to develop an efficient, reliable and sustainable approach based on hypeispectral imaging (HSI) operating in SWIR range (1000-2500 nm) coupled with chemometrics, specifically addressed to identify plastics containing BFRs. In order to investigate the possibility of reliable sorting, plastic scraps from cathode ray tube with different contents of BFRs were investigated. The concentration of bromine per scrap was preliminary measured by X-ray fluorescence in order to validate the results obtained by HSI. The recyclable low-bromine fraction was successfully identified using the developed strategy based on HSI.

In the last few decades much effort has been devoted worldwide to extend the applications of such materials by conferring on them new properties through mixing and blending with different additives. In this latter context, nanocomposites have recently offered new exciting possibilities. This review discusses the successful use of nanostructured dispersed substrates in designing new stimuli-responsive nanocomposites; in particular, it provides an updated description of the synthetic routes to prepare nanostructured systems having the typical properties of thermoplastic polymers (continuous matrix), but showing enhanced optical, conductive, and thermal features dependent on the dispersion topology. The controlled nanodispersion of functional labeled clays, noble metal nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes is here evidenced to play a key role in producing hybrid thermoplastic materials that have been used in the design of devices, such as NLO devices, chemiresistors, temperature and deformation sensors.

Assessment of 3D printing using fused deposition modeling and selective laser sintering for a circular economy	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION			English	Article						Circular Economy; Additive Manufacturing; 3D Printing; Recycling; SLS; FDM	ABS; DEGRADATION	Plastic today is commonplace. Products and parts made with plastic have short life cycles, ending up in landfills not long after manufacture. Finding new pathways for plastic waste has become a critical focus of sustainability efforts, especially within manufacturing. Thus, research in this field continues to grow in order to determine the feasibility of reclaiming post-consumer plastic for reuse. This paper evaluates the potential for a sustainable, circular pathway for end-of-life plastic material using 3D-printing techniques. To do this, the work investigates two prevalent industrial 3D-printing technologies: selective laser sintering (SLS) and fused deposition modeling (FDM) of polymers. Material-flow and economic models are developed to outline how plastic parts at the end of their life cycle can be processed and reused. Prior works on fundamental material degradation are integrated into mathematical models of cost and operation. This enables mapping of how multiple reuse cycles affect two prevalent industrial polymers: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polyamide 12 (PA 12). The mapping identifies there is significant opportunity for improving both SLS and FDM 3D-printing technologies when it comes to economic viability and sustainability. Comparison between reuse of FDM using ABS and SLS using PA 12 shows the former costs 82% less than the latter, while also producing 87% less waste than it.

The parts produced possess good strength, low weight, excellent mechanical properties and are cost-effective. This saves a considerable amount of both time and carrying cost. Thereof the challenges and opportunities that the space sector holds for AM is worth reviewing to provide a better insight into further developments and prospects for this technology. Design/methodology/approach The potentiality of 3D printing for the manufacturing of various components under space conditions has been explained. Here, the authors have reviewed the details of manufactured parts used for zero gravity missions, subjected to onboard International Space Station conditions and with those manufactured on earth. Followed by the major opportunities in 3D printing in space which include component repair, material characterization, process improvement and process development along with the new designs. The challenges such as space conditions, availability of power in space, the infrastructure requirements and the quality control or testing of the items that are being built in space are explained along with their possible mitigation strategies. Findings These components are well comparable with those prepared on earth which enables a massive cost saving. Other than the onboard manufacturing process, numerous other components and a complete robot/satellite for outer space applications were manufactured by AM. Moreover, these components can be recycled on board to produce feedstock for the next materials. The parts produced in space are bought back and compared with those built on earth. There is a difference in their nature i.e. the flight specimen showed a brittle nature and the ground specimen showed a denser nature. Originality/value The review discusses the advancements of 3D printing in space and provides numerous examples of the applications of 3D printing in space and space applications. The paper is solely dedicated to 3D printing in space. It provides a breakthrough in the literature as a limited amount of literature is available on this topic. The paper aims at highlighting all the challenges that AM faces in the space sector and also the future opportunities that await development.

Several additives have been used to rejuvenate the RAP's aged bitumen. The authors previously studied full recycling of RAP rejuvenated with waste cooking oil (WCO). The asphalt concrete (AC) manufactured revealed good mechanical behaviour except for rutting resistance. Therefore, they decided to also include in the asphalt mixtures low density polyethylene (LDPE) from urban waste as a low-cost polymer to improve that weak point and verify if this technique was feasible and with potential as a pavement material. A laboratory plan was conceived to evaluate the mechanical performance of two rejuvenated ACs with WCO and LDPE. Stiffness, water sensitivity, resistance to rutting and fatigue cracking were evaluated. The results showed that, despite some empirical parameters usually indicated in current specifications not being met, the performance of the studied asphalt mixtures was adequate and, thus, there are good expectations about the future use of these solutions in real pavements, particularly for low and intermediate traffic levels. Based on a global analysis of the performance observed, the main conclusion was that full recycling of AC with WCO and LDPE is feasible, and the score obtained was higher than that of a conventional AC used for comparison.

In this contribution, a facile printing strategy is followed for an in-house synthesized thermoplastic poly(ether urethane). Processing by means of fused filament fabrication, in which the difference between nozzle temperature and material-specific glass transition temperature of the polymer is kept as low as possible, allows to obtain highly shrinkable objects whose shape and thermoresponsiveness can be precisely controlled. The effectiveness of the method also applies to the printing material polylactic acid. One possible application lies in highly shrinkable objects for assembly purposes. As proof-of-concept, lightweight hands-free door openers for healthcare applications are functionally simulated and developed. Once printed, such devices shrink when heated to fit on door handles, allowing an easy assembly. At the end-of-use, a heating-initiated disassembling and mechanical recycling are proposed. In perspective, a reuse of the materials in 4D printing can contribute to the emergence of a circular economy for such highly functional materials.

Many types of reinforcement, i.e., steel rebars, fiber-reinforced polymer, have been introduced to improve the structure's mechanical behavior under dynamic loading. In this paper, the Primitive minimal surface -one type of the triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structure -is employed as reinforcement of cement-based beams. The TPMS-Primitive reinforcement scaffolds and molds are printed with thermoplastic Polylactic Acid (PLA) material, then pouring cementitious mortar to cast the beams. Different thicknesses and a linear functionally graded thickness of the TPMS-Primitive scaffolds are numerically investigated. This design helps address corrosion-associated failures in traditional reinforcement. Three types of beams, one-and two-layer TPMS-Primitive reinforced beams and one non-reinforced beam, are fabricated for impact tests. Experimental and numerical results are quite consistent in terms of the time history of impact forces, energy absorption, and failure patterns. The research outcomes indicate that considerable robustness in load-bearing ability is witnessed in TPMS-Primitive reinforced cementitious beams. Fabrication of this type of reinforcement can be achievable by using advanced additive manufacturing of recycled plastic.

J	Williams, RJ; Fox, L; Majewski, C				Williams, Rhys J.; Fox, Luke; Majewski, Candice			The effect of powder age in high speed sintering of poly(propylene)	RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL			English	Article						Advanced manufacturing technologies; Additive manufacturing; High speed sintering; Poly(propylene); Powder ageing	BEHAVIOR; POLYPROPYLENE	Purpose This study aims to demonstrate for the first time that the cheap, commodity polymer, poly(propylene), can be successfully processed using high speed sintering, and that it can be recycled several times through the process, with little to no detriment to either the polymer itself or the parts obtained. This is significant as a step towards the realisation of high speed sintering as a technology for high-volume manufacturing. Design/methodology/approach A poly(propylene) powder designed for laser sintering was used to build parts on a high speed sintering machine. The unsintered powder was then collected and reused. Repeating this process allowed creation of seven generations of aged powder. A variety of characterisation techniques were then used to measure polymer, powder and part properties for each generation to discern any effects arising from ageing in the machine. Findings It was found that poly(propylene) could be used successfully in high speed sintering, albeit with a low build success rate. Increased powder age was found to correlate to an increase in the build success rate, changes in microscopic and bulk powder properties and improvement to the dimensional accuracy of the parts obtained. By contrast, no discernible correlations were seen between powder age and polymer molecular weight, or between powder age and the tensile properties of parts. Originality/value This is the first report of the use of poly(propylene) in high speed sintering. It is also first study regarding powder recyclability in high speed sintering, both in general and using poly(propylene) specifically.

The waste plastic toys can pose a great risk to both people and the environment; at the same time, we will lose many valuable materials that could be recycled. The aim of the present study was to explore the possibility of producing high quality products from waste plastic toys whilst enabling waste plastics to retain their original colour profile. First, the recyclability of the waste plastic toys was investigated using a single screw extruder. The physical, chemical and mechanical properties of prepared filaments were evaluated. Repeated thermo-mechanical stresses did not alter the properties of polymers significantly until ten reprocessing cycles, which suggests that waste plastic toys can be recycled at the end of their lives. Then, the filaments produced from both waste plastic toys and virgin polymer served to fabricate products using a three-dimensional (3D) printer, to examine the possibility of producing high quality products using new manufacturing techniques. The tensile strength, elastic modulus and impact strength of the printed product were found to be 32 +/- 2 MPa, 2253 +/- 271 MPa and 40 +/- 1 kJ/m(2), respectively. The mechanical properties of the 3D printed specimens from waste plastics were as good as virgin material. The process developed in this study can reduce carbon footprint and production cost. The utilisation of waste plastic toys as feedstock to produce new plastic products is not only an environment-friendly option but also profitable.

Mechanical Properties of Direct Waste Printing of Polylactic Acid with Universal Pellets Extruder: Comparison to Fused Filament Fabrication on Open-Source Desktop Three-Dimensional Printers	3D PRINTING AND ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						fused granular fabrication; recycling; polylactic acid; tensile properties; distributed recycling	LIFE-CYCLE ANALYSIS; LARGE-SCALE; EXTRUSION SYSTEM; 3D; POLYMER; DESIGN; REPRAP; DEPOSITION; VIRGIN	Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is the most common and widespread additive manufacturing (AM) technique, but it requires the formation of filament. Fused granular fabrication (FGF), where plastic granules are directly three-dimensional (3D) printed, has become a promising technique for the AM technology. FGF could be a key driver to promote further greening of distributed recycling thanks to the reduced melt solidification steps and elimination of the filament extruder system. However, only large-scale FGF systems have been tested for technical and economic viability of recycling plastic materials. The objective of this work is to evaluate the performance of the FFF and FGF techniques in terms of technical and economical dimensions at the desktop 3D printing scale. Recycled and virgin polylactic acid material was studied by using five different types of recycling feedstocks: commercial filament, pellets, distributed filament, distributed pellets, and shredded waste. The results showed that the mechanical properties from the FGF technique using same configurations showed no statistical differences to FFF samples. Nevertheless, the granulometry could have an influence on the reproducibility of the samples, which explains that the critical factor in this technology is to assure the material input in the feeding system. In addition, FGF costs per kg of material were reduced to less than 1 euro/kg compared with more than 20 euro/kg for commercial recycled filament. These results are encouraging to foster FGF printer diffusion among heavy users of 3D printers because of reducing the cost associated to the filament fabrication while ensuring the technical quality. This indicates the possibility of a new type of 3D printing recycled plastic waste that is more likely to drive a circular economy and distributed recycling.

Clear financial drivers for this process have not been studied in the past. Thus, in this study the Gigabot X, an open source industrial 3D printer, which has been shown to be amenable to a wide array of recyclables for FPF/FGF 3D printing, is used to evaluate this economic potential. An economic life cycle analysis of the technology is completed comprised of three cases studies using FPF for large sporting equipment products. Sensitivities are run on the electricity costs for operation, materials costs from various feed stocks and the capacity factors of the 3D printers. The results showed that FPF/FGF 3D printing is capable of energy efficient production of a wide range of large high-value sporting goods products. In all cases, a substantial economic savings was observed when comparing the materials and energy related costs to commercial goods (even for customized goods). Using locally-sourced shredded plastic represented not only the best environmental option, but also the most economic. For the case study products analyzed even the lowest capacity factor (starting only one print per week) represented a profit when comparing to high-end value products. For some products the profit potential and return on investment was substantial (e.g. over 1000%) for high capacity use of a Gigabot X. The results clearly show that open source industrial FPF/FGF 3D printers have significant economic potential when used as a distributed recycling/manufacturing system using recyclable feed stocks in the green fab lab context.

Alternatively, this study targets the cascading use of these resources within a circular green manufacturing scheme, examining for the first time the utilization of recycled nonwoven textile Polypropylene (PPt), selected from single-use disposable technical-grade garments in the function of matrix-phase; for the development of non-toxic thermoplastic-lignocellulose hybrid sheet materials engineered for building applications. For this purpose two sources of recycled Polypropylene -textile and food packaging- were selected for the comparative analysis between fibrillated and particulate matrices; and wood fibres sourced from furniture manufacturing residual waste were selected as the lignocellulosic disperse-phase, formulated in the ratio of 40/60 wt%, respectively. The hybrid compounds were mechanically micronized, homogenized, and no coupling agent or additives were incorporated. The overall experimental results indicated PPt presented competitive advantages over the particulate polypropylene due to distinctive morphological, microstructural, crystallinity, and chemical variances; which improved the Filler-Matrix interfacial behaviour, increased the hydrophobicity of the blend, as well as facilitated the thermal-processing of the hybrid prototypes during isothermal hot-compression. Consequently, the end-product exhibited peak performance for flexural strength, moisture resistance, and fire-retardant properties, thus, suggesting that disposable technical-grade PP textiles introduce a viable alternative solution for the advancement of multifunctional sustainable building materials manufactured entirely from heterogeneous complex waste mixtures.

Towards smart monitored AM: Open source in-situ layer-wise 3D printing image anomaly detection using histograms of oriented gradients and a physics-based rendering engine	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Anomaly detection; Blender; HOG; Synthetic images	FUSED FILAMENT FABRICATION; WASTE POLYMER; REPRAP; SYSTEM; MODEL	This study presents an open source method for detecting 3D printing anomalies by comparing images of printed layers from a stationary monocular camera with G-code-based reference images of an ideal process generated with Blender, an open source free physics rendering engine. Recognition of visual deviations was accomplished by analyzing the similarity of histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) of local image areas. The developed technique requires preliminary modeling of the working environment to achieve the best match for orientation, color rendering, lighting, and other parameters of the printed part. The output of the algorithm is a level of mismatch between printed and synthetic reference layers. Twelve similarity and distance measures were implemented and compared for their effectiveness at detecting 3D printing errors on six different representative failure types (local infill defects, presence of a foreign body in the layer, spaghetti problem, separation and shift of the printing part from the working surface, defects in thin walls, and layer shift) and their control error-free print images. The results show that although Kendall's tau, Jaccard, and Sorensen similarities are the most sensitive, Pearson's r, Spearman's rho, cosine, and Dice similarities produce the more distinguishable results. This open source method allows the program to notice critical errors in the early stages of their occurrence and either pause manufacturing processes for further investigation by an operator or in the future intelligent automatic error correction. The implementation of this novel method does not require preliminary data for training, and the greatest efficiency can be achieved with the mass production of parts by either additive or subtractive manufacturing of the same geometric shape. This open-source method has the potential means of enabling smart distributed recycling for additive manufacturing in challenging environments.

Moreover, little efforts are involved in some parts of the world associated to plastic waste collection, recycling and reuse. Considering all these prerequisites, the identification and discussion of risks generated by plastic production and waste in the environment are performed in this paper and some measures for plastic waste reduction were proposed. Although plastic polymers are not considered toxic, some residual monomers contained in the materials can be hazardous. Also, many chemical compounds used in the plastics manufacturing as additives, in particular plasticizers are dangerous to human health and the environment, along with some degradation products that may be released during the plastic life cycle. Bearing in mind the potential impacts and risks generated by these products in the environment and for humans, the paper highlights that the current requirements and tendencies are to reduce the need for plastic, the enhancement of recycling and recovering the waste, simultaneously with the replacement of plastic from fossil fuel with a continuous widening spectrum of biodegradable polymers. Bioplastics began to be recognized as a positive and important invention of chemical and plastics industry, providing many and varied opportunities for environmental impacts and risks abatement.

However, material aging and part performance stability are still challenges to face in LS irrespective of protective atmosphere. Consequently, this work focuses on the essence of these problems and investigations on systematical mechanism of PA-12 aging and its micro-structural evolution during IS. The results show that the mechanism mainly has two opposite aspects concerning the material processability. On one hand, analogous Brill transition of peak merging, which is discovered for the first time in the powder aging process of LS PA-12 material, leads to a higher one set melting temperature of the aged powder and broadens the sintering window more than 1 degrees C after 3 recycling. On the other, the existence of solid-state and melt-state polycondensation, which is proved by XPS and rheological measurements, induces the higher temperature nucleation for the aged powder and the crystallization postponement for aged LS parts detected in DSC. The effect of solid-state polycondensation reduces the crystallinity of the powder by 6% after 3 recycling. This mechanism is of the guiding significance for powder stability improvement and consistent control of component properties next.

In selective laser sintering (SLS), the price can be reduced by the recycling of material, i.e., with different shares of original and recycled material, as well as by the orientation of the product during manufacturing. Numerous tests warn that orientation in the direction of z axis should be as low as possible to reduce the total price of the product. The product also has to satisfy the influence of atmospheric conditions to which it is exposed during its lifetime, i.e., UV radiation and humid environment. UV light, with sun being its most common source, and average humidity in different parts of the world can be approximately from 20% to 90%, depending on time, day and geographic location. In this work, the test specimens have been made of original, mixed and 100% recycled material and then exposed to the influences of UV radiation and water absorption. After having been exposed to atmospheric conditions for a longer time, the mechanical properties of the polyamide products made by selective laser sintering were tested. The results show that exposure to UV radiation reduces tensile elongation at all ratios of recycled material and orientation of 70-90% except in the z direction, while in flexural deformation it is the other way around. The effect of water was observed only between the 7th-14th day of absorption with a decrease in strength until the deformation did not change.

Therefore, the objective of this paper was to use glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) waste in adobe production. Compositions varying from 0 to 10% mass residues were produced and evaluated in physical, mechanical and thermal tests. The addition of 10% GFRP waste showed the best results when compared to adobe without additives, demonstrated as follows: shrinkage reduction of 239%; bulk density reduction of 6%; thermal conductivity reduction of 21%; mass loss reduction when submerged in water; and compressive strength increase of 45%. Therefore, the use of GFRP residue is indicated in the manufacture of adobe to improve its physical, mechanical and thermal conductivity properties. In addition to providing a destination for a considerable quantity of the waste, the commercial value of the final product is higher due to using a residue with low degradability and high energy power due to burning during recycling.

Additive manufacturing of continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites using fused deposition modelling: Effect of process parameters on mechanical properties	COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						3D printing; Fused deposition modelling; Continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites; Mechanical characterization; Process parameters; Failure analysis	CONTINUOUS CARBON-FIBER; POLYMER COMPOSITES; 3D; PLA; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR; IMPACT; FABRICATION; RESISTANCE; GLASS	Continuous Fibre Reinforced Thermoplastic Composites (CFRTPCs) are becoming alternative materials to replace the conventional thermosetting polymers and metals due to excellent mechanical performance, recycling and potential used in lightweight structures. Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is a promising additive manufacturing technology and an alternative of conventional processes for the fabrication of CFRTPCs due to its ability to build functional parts having complex geometries. The mechanical properties of a built part depend on several process parameters. The aim of this study is to characterize the effect of build orientation, layer thickness and fibre volume content on the mechanical performance of 3D printed continuous fibre reinforced composites components manufactured by a desktop 3D printer. Tensile and three-point bending tests are carried out to determine the mechanical response of the printed specimens. SEM images of fractured surfaces are evaluated to determine the effects of process parameters on failure modes. It is observed that the effect of layer thickness of nylon samples on the mechanical performance is marginally significant. In addition, continuous fibre reinforced samples show higher strength and stiffness values than unreinforced ones. The results show that carbon fibre reinforced composites exhibit the best mechanical performance with higher stiffness and flat samples exhibit higher values of strength and stiffness than on-edge samples. Additionally, the results show that strength and stiffness increase as fibre volume content increases in most cases but, conversely, the level of increment in mechanical performance is moderate with continued rise in fibre content, particularly in the case of Kevlar (R) and glass fibres, due to weak bonding between the fibre/nylon layers as well as the presence of increased levels of defects.

J	Geyer, R; Jambeck, JR; Law, KL				Geyer, Roland; Jambeck, Jenna R.; Law, Kara Lavender			Production, use, and fate of all plastics ever made	SCIENCE ADVANCES			English	Article							FLOW-ANALYSIS; LIFE-SPAN; MICROPLASTICS; ENVIRONMENTS; ECOSYSTEMS; FIBERS; STEEL; LAND	Plastics have outgrown most man-made materials and have long been under environmental scrutiny. However, robust global information, particularly about their end-of-life fate, is lacking. By identifying and synthesizing dispersed data on production, use, and end-of-life management of polymer resins, synthetic fibers, and additives, we present the first global analysis of all mass-produced plastics ever manufactured. We estimate that 8300 million metric tons (Mt) as of virgin plastics have been produced to date. As of 2015, approximately 6300 Mt of plastic waste had been generated, around 9% of which had been recycled, 12% was incinerated, and 79% was accumulated in landfills or the natural environment. If current production and waste management trends continue, roughly 12,000 Mt of plastic waste will be in landfills or in the natural environment by 2050.

To find viable solutions and reduce such alarming issues, innovative research work on recycling of unutilized materials such as fly ash and natural cellulosic polymers has been reported in this work to develop advanced sustainable hybrid micro/nano composites. In this study, the use of natural cellulosic sisal fibers with fly ash has enhanced the tensile properties and surface finish of composites. Fly ash particulates acted as fillers, additives, as well as surface-finishing medium and sisal fibers as reinforcing elements in achieving glossy finish sustainable composites. The developed composites have been found to be stronger than wood, plastics and have many opportunities for multifunctional applications. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A simple route toward next-gen green energy storage concept by nanofibres-based self-supporting electrodes and a solid polymeric design	CARBON			English	Article							LI-ION BATTERIES; PAPER; CELLULOSE; ELECTROLYTES; CATALYSTS; BEHAVIOR; CELLS	A novel, unique, truly-solid Li-ion cell structural design, based on LiFePO4/graphite electrodes and profoundly ionic conducting polymer electrolyte, is fabricated by exploiting, for the first time, carbonised cellulose nanofibrils as both the conductive binder and the current collector substrate. Moreover, cellulose nanofibrils are used as reinforcing additive for the preparation of the unconventional composite polymer electrolyte separator. The resulting solid polymeric lab-scale Li-ion cell, assembled in a "pouch cell" envelop, shows remarkably stable characteristics upon prolonged cycling at ambient temperature even at high current regimes. By the way, a simple procedure, easily scalable, is optimized for the spray coating and water-based papermaking. As a result, all components can be fully recovered at the end of the cell operational life by taking advantage of a simple water-based paper recycling technique, opening new horizons for the manufacture of sustainable electrochemical energy storage devices.

The technology of creation of decking on the basis of wood-plastic composite, consisting of surface and inner layer is presented in the article. The surface layer of the product is made from wood flour, polypropylene, impact resistance modifier and special additives. The inner layer consists of recycled thermoplastic polymer, filled with waste wood up to 10 mm. The influence of the concentration of the species of wood filler on the water absorption and hardness of the samples as well as a group of combustibility of the product has been studied. Researches on the biological stability of floorings that show high resistance to the damaging action of microorganisms are presented. It was found that this construction material is practically non swells and absorbs little moisture in comparison with the analogues. The presence of the inner layer significantly increases the strength and reduces the final cost of the product compared with competing in these market segment materials.

Dynamic Semicrystalline Networks of Polypropylene with Thiol-Anhydride Exchangeable Crosslinks	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						thermoplastic; polypropylene; vitrimer; thiol-anhydrate; thiol-thioester; plastic recycling; 3D printing	MALEIC-ANHYDRIDE; POLYETHYLENE; VITRIMERS; COPOLYMERS; OSTEOLYSIS; MORPHOLOGY; MOLTEN; WEAR	Thermoplastic polyolefins (TPOs) crosslinked by dynamic covalent bonds (xTPOs) have the potential to be the most utilized class of polymer in the world, with applications ranging from household and automotive to biomedical devices and additive manufacturing. xTPO combines the benefits of thermoplastics and thermosets in a "single material" and potentially avoids their shortcomings. Here, we describe a new two-stage reaction extrusion strategy of TPOs with a backbone consisting of inert C-C bonds (polypropylene, PP), and thiol-anhydride, to dynamically crosslink PP through thiol-thioester bond exchange. The degree of PP crosslinking determines the rubber plateau modulus above the melting point of the plastic: the modulus at 200 degrees C increases from zero in the melt to 23 kPa at 6% crosslinking, to 60 kPa at 20%, to 105 kPa at 40%. The overall mechanical strength of the solid xTPO plastic is 25% higher compared to the original PP, and the gel fraction of xTPO reaches 55%. Finally, we demonstrate that the crosslinked xTPO material is readily reprocessable (recycled, remolded, rewelded, and 3D printed).

Nevertheless, the AR suffers from serious problems: it is too viscous to handle and needs special continuous agitating unit to avoid phase segregation. However, a good alternative is wet process Terminal Blend (TB) rubberized binder which is different from AR in terms of manufacturing process, modification mechanism and binder performance. Although been considered as a viable competitor against polymer modified asphalt, TB binder has not received extensive application due to some concerns. The present paper aimed to provide a comprehensive overview on TB recycled tyre rubber modified binder in terms of basic terminology, binder processing, performance evaluation, applications and primary limitations. Most importantly, the latest progresses in TB binders and their limitations were introduced based on up-to-date researches. Special emphases were laid on the composite modification to TB asphalts using various modifiers such as polymers, acids, nano material and natural rock asphalt. In addition, the combination of currently prevailing warm mix additives with TB rubberized binder was also summarized and discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Some of the problems described by the athletes when using the mouthguards can be addressed by producing customized devices with thinner walls by additive processing techniques. In the present work, new polymeric materials for this application, such as poly(lactic acid) (rPLA) recycled from food packaging, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), high impact polystyrene (HIPS), and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), are proposed for the preparation of protective mouthguards, in alternative to the ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer, the current gold standard. Specimens were printed with two different thicknesses (2 mm and 4 mm) to study their influence on the final properties of the printed samples. The characterization included chemical, thermal, surface, and mechanical aspects of commercially acquired polymeric filaments and printed components. All the studied materials showed a decrease in the impact strength with increasing specimen thickness, except for TPU due to its highest deformation capacity. Compared with EVA, TPU has a similar energy absorption, while the other polymers presented higher values. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

One way to improve its sustainability is via distributed recycling of plastics in homes, schools, and libraries to create feedstock filament for printing. Risks from exposures incurred during recycling and reuse of plastics has not been incorporated into life cycle assessments. This study characterized contaminant releases from virgin (unextruded) and recycled plastics from filament production through FFF 3-D printing. Waste polylactic acid (PLA) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastics were recycled to create filament; virgin PLA, ABS, high and low density polyethylenes, high impact polystyrene, and polypropylene pellets were also extruded into filament. The release of particles and chemicals into school classrooms was evaluated using standard industrial hygiene methodologies. All tasks released particles that contained hazardous metals (e.g., manganese) and with size capable of depositing in the gas exchange region of the lung, i.e., granulation of waste PLA and ABS (667 to 714 nm) and filament making (608 to 711 nm) and FFF 3-D printing (616 to 731 nm) with waste and virgin plastics. All tasks released vapors, including respiratory irritants and potential carcinogens (benzene and formaldehyde), mucus membrane irritants (acetone, xylenes, ethylbenzene, and methyl methacrylate), and asthmagens (styrene, multiple carbonyl compounds). These data are useful for incorporating risks of exposure to hazardous contaminants in future life cycle evaluations to demonstrate the sustainability and circular economy potential of FFF 3-D printing in distributed spaces.

Preparation and characterization of olive pit powder as a filler to PLA-matrix bio-composites	POWDER TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Olive pit powder; PIA; Grinding; Size distribution; Morphology; Mechanical properties	LIGNOCELLULOSIC WASTE FLOUR; STONE	This study is focused on recycling potential of some waste materials, such as olive pits, i.e. the solid phase derived from an olive oil mill, blended with thermoplastic polymers and used for the production of new materials applied in manufacturing containers and formworks. The olive pit powders are described and characterized. Then the powder is introduced in a bio-based and biodegradable matrix (polylactic acid, PIA) at various percentages. In this study, a comparison of the size distribution and the densities of olive pit powders according to the grinding methods ( planetary mill and centrifugal mill) was made. The analyses showed that olive pits can be further studied as additive for the production of green materials. The development of an agricultural based polymer matrix compatible with olive pits and consequently a fully biodegradable composite system is the future and ultimate goal of the research undertaken. For that purpose, composite samples made out of PLA matrix, reinforced with olive pit powders were manufactured and mechanically characterized. With filler loading, an increase in the tensile modulus but a decrease of the flexural strength may be due to the poor interfacial bonding between olive pit powder and PIA (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Designing antimicrobial polypropylene films with grape pomace extract for food packaging	FOOD PACKAGING AND SHELF LIFE			English	Article						Polypropylene; Grape; Biomass residue; Antimicrobial; Packaging	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; ANTIOXIDANT; DEGRADATION; PRODUCTS; BEHAVIOR	Grape pomace (mixture of skins and seeds) is a residual by-product of the winemaking process, rich in poly -phenolic compounds that have antioxidant and antimicrobial properties and can be recycled to manufacture fruit extracts to be used in new technological products. The use of non-toxic substances is exciting for developing packagings that are in direct contact with food, as components present in the polymer might migrate to the food. Moreover, the gradual release of these non-toxic bioactive components confers long-term antimicrobial activity to these PP films enriched with grape pomace extract. In addition, the use of raw materials from natural and renewable origins to manufacture antimicrobial packaging contributes to a more sustainable and eco-friendly industrial production and to mitigate environmental impacts. In this research, bactericidal isotactic poly-propylene (PP) was developed using grape pomace extract as an antimicrobial additive and presents low water vapor permeability and antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Ba-cillus subtilis) bacteria, showing potential to function as an active and safer polymeric food packaging.

Consequently, plastic waste generated will be increased exponentially. Polylactic acid (PLA) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are extensively used polymer as the filament for 3D printing. Therefore, the reprocessing of the fragments is necessary to reduce the plastic pollution. This study the aims to investigate the conversion of PET to terephthalic acid (TPA) and its conversion breakthrough via caustic soda hydrolysis. Meanwhile, the effect of PLA dissolution and its integration with glycerol to produced bioplastic was investigated. Fragment of PET was undergone hydrolysis process at different time and the conversion rate showed increment as prolong reaction time. TPA yield produced follow the same trend of PET conversion. FTIR analysis proved the formation of TPA after the hydrolysis process due to the formation of O-H and C-H which corresponding to the formation of carboxylic acid and ethylene glycol of TPA. Concurrently, PLA was dissolved in chloroform at different time and mixed with glycerol which acts as plasticizer to form PLA/glycerol plastic. It was found that the longer dissolution time, the higher the percentage of PLA dissolved. From FTIR analysis, the functional group of PLA has changed indicated that the reaction between dissolved PLA and glycerol has been taken placed. The results indicate that PET degradation can occur at low cost and on this basis. Ergo, this formation of valuable products from waste polymers can be an alternative method in promoting reduced waste generation. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lesnau, A; Tyliszczak, M; Kunda, K				Lesnau, Anna; Tyliszczak, Miroslaw; Kunda, Krzysztof			An Alternative Method for Synthetic Polymers Waste Processing Using the Low Temperature Pyrolysis Process	ADVANCES IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article						recycling; priolysis; plastics; eco-energy; pyrolysis oil	POLYESTER-GLASS; COMPOSITES; TECHNOLOGY	Plastics, due to their numerous advantages, are becoming materials more and more widely used in all branches of industry. The number of products, packaging and waste made of synthetic polymers is constantly increasing, which results in a growing threat to the environment due to long time of decomposition of the manufactured products. The future development of plastic recycling methods appears to be a necessary and significant step in materials processing and environmental protection. During the last two decades. a large number of promising research results on the catalytic pyrolysis process of plastics have been reported. This paper presents an alternative method for synthetic polymers waste processing using the low temperature pyrolysis process. The aim of this method is to manage the waste efficiently, but also to reduce the demand for fossil fuels. Commercial fuels and mixtures of these fuels with the pyrolytic oil obtained in low-temperature pyrolytic process were used for the purpose of this study, The following parameters of the obtained fuel mixtures were tested: density, viscosity, flash point, water content, cetane number, cold filter blocking temperature, cloud pint and lubricity, using following equipment: oscillating densitometer, Stabinger viscometer, Penske-Martens Closed cup tester, apparatus for coulometric determination of water content by Karl-Fischer method, calorimeter. All tests were carried out in accordance with European standards for crude oil and petroleum products. The obtained results are promising and by contribution of the pyrolytic oil additives it is possible to significantly reduce the share of petroleum products used in the fuels production process and contribute to the beneficial management of artificial waste.

Distributed Manufacturing of Flexible Products: Technical Feasibility and Economic Viability	TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						distributed manufacturing; additive manufacturing; 3-D printing; consumer; economics; flexible materials; open-source; thermoplastic elastomer; thermoplastic polyurethane	LIFE-CYCLE ANALYSIS; ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN; POLYMER; CONSUMERS; REPRAP; INNOVATION; PRINTERS; WASTE; SCALE	Distributed manufacturing even at the household level is now well established with the combined use of open source designs and self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printers. Previous work has shown substantial economic consumer benefits for producing their own polymer products. Now flexible filaments are available at roughly 3-times the cost of more conventional 3-D printing materials. To provide some insight into the potential for flexible filament to be both technically feasible and economically viable for distributed digital manufacturing at the consumer level this study investigates 20 common flexible household products. The 3-D printed products were quantified by print time, electrical energy use and filament consumption by mass to determine the cost to fabricate with a commercial RepRap 3-D printer. Printed parts were inspected and when necessary tested for their targeted application to ensure technical feasibility. Then, the experimentally measured cost to DIY manufacturers was compared to low and high market prices for comparable commercially available products. In addition, the mark-up and potential for long-term price declines was estimated for flexible filaments by converting thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) pellets into filament and reground TPE from a local recycling center into filament using an open source recyclebot. This study found that commercial flexible filament is economically as well as technically feasible for providing a means of distributed home-scale manufacturing of flexible products. The results found a 75% savings when compared to the least expensive commercially equivalent products and 92% when compared to high market priced products. Roughly, 160 flexible objects must be substituted to recover the capital costs to print flexible materials. However, as previous work has shown the Lulzbot Mini 3-D printer used in this study would provide more than a 100% ROI printing one object a week from hard thermoplastics, the upgrade needed to provide flexible filament capabilities can be accomplished with 37 average substitution flexible prints. This, again easily provides a triple digit return on investment printing one product a week. Although these savings, which are created by printing objects at home are substantial, the results also have shown the savings could be further increased to 93% when the use of a pellet extruder and TPE pellets, and 99% if recycled TPE filament made with a recyclebot is used. The capital costs of a recyclebot can be recovered in the manufacturing of about 9 kg of TPE filament, which can be accomplished in less than a week, enabling improved environmental impact as well as a strong financial return for heavy 3-D printer users.

The effects of solvent, dissolution temperature and time and cooling method and speed on the particle size and morphologies of the prepared nylon elastomer powder are investigated. Design/methodology/approach The prepared nylon elastomer power possesses the particle size of around 50 mm and is spherical in shape, indicating that this study provides the feasible dissolution-precipitation process, a distillation cooling method and a suitable solvent to prepare nylon elastomer powders. Findings Compared to pure nylon 12, the nylon elastomer has a lower part bed temperature and a wider sintering window for the SLS process. The wider sintering window indicates the better SLS processibility. The lower part bed temperature is beneficial to the recycling of material and the decrease in the requirement of SLS equipment. Originality/value The nylon elastomer in this study has a lower part bed temperature and a wider sintering window for the SLS process. The wider sintering window indicates better SLS processibility.

The differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements characterize the material by recording their phase and mass changes as a function of temperature. The DSC results confirmed the decrease of crystallinity with the inclusion of nano fillers but also realized that these filler particles act as a thermodynamic sink and improves its stability. The TGA analysis also demonstrated the increase in thermal stability and flame retardancy level of NC material.

These are: firstly multifunction can be embedded at a material level such as the use of nanomaterials within a polymer. In the second instance, discrete material systems can be added together. Examples are laminate systems in food pouches consisting of thin layers of metal and polymer. In the third process this can be achieved by integrating these materials systems together to form one holistically behaving component with multifunctionality. An example is an embedded antenna in an automotive windscreen.Drivers for multifunctionality include the increased push towards intelligent objects, such as the creation of the internet of things. Here, the embedding of communication and electronic function into daily consumer objects, such as milk cartons and food packaging are demanded. This must be offset by consideration of the related rise of a new wave of short-lifetime waste electronic and electronic equipment, incapable with current plastic recycling infrastructure, for disposal systems to adapt too. Designing integrated and multifunctional plastic components however, is complicated by the sheer number of material choices, multiple processing platforms, cost implications and environmental legislation. Considering just the processes of injection moulding, compression moulding and additive manufacturing, a designer is confronted with considerable complexity and numerous engineering design and stakeholder issues to consider. This paper presents examples of current state of art in multifunctional systems and discusses the barriers and potential solutions to creating fully realized multifunctional systems within a polymeric manufacturing environment. Impacts on material lifecycles and disposal infrastructures must be considered, as is the necessity to retain diversity with new integrated and advanced manufacturing processes suitable for the demands of mass customization, automation and Industry 4.0.

Thermal conductivity enhancement of recycled high density polyethylene as a storage media for latent heat thermal energy storage	SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS			English	Article						Thermal energy storage; Phase change material; Thermal conductivity; Recycled composite	PHASE-CHANGE MATERIAL; CHANGE MATERIAL PCM; COMPOSITE; SOLIDIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; BUILDINGS; ADDITIVES; SYSTEM; TUBE; FINS	In the context of reducing CO2 emissions and balancing energy supply and demand across the electricity grid, energy storage has become an important topic. Therefore, new energy policies are looking for more efficient and environmental friendly technologies. The aim of this research is to assist in the implementation of the renewable energies technologies and to improve the energy efficiency in well-known and established processes by recovering and storing heat. Moreover, the use of a recycled material as a storage media for thermal energy storage applications shows a more sustainable use of resources reducing at the same time the overall cost. In this research a novel composite, a recycled high density polyethylene (HDPE)/graphite(Cg) mixture, for medium temperature thermal energy storage application has been formulated and characterized. One common characteristic of polymers is their low thermal conductivities. This causes a slow thermal response when the PCM is used in high power applications. In this study the thermal conductivity properties of the HDPE/Cg were enhanced by the optimization of its manufacturing process and composition. Graphite content was added in different mass fractions into the PCM, and thermal properties were measured by means of Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Laser Flash Analysis (LFA). The experimental results showed that the thermal conductivities are improved by the higher mass fraction of graphite. When the graphite content was in the ratio of 20 wt%, the thermal conductivity of the PCM increased from 0.51 W m(-1) K-1 up to 1.31 W m(-1) K-1. The secondary electron microscopy confirms a good homogeneity of the manufacturing process. Further chemical stability analysis was performed by means of charging and discharging processes. The cycled samples present good thermal property reliability at temperatures up to 250 degrees C. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Used lubricant oils (ULOs) are highly polluted materials and it is harmful to nature. These pollutants contains toxic materials such as Poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and soot, air dust and heavy metals, makes black oil as a serious hazard. If not properly handled or disposed of, this can lead to significant health and environmental problems. Hence, the controlling of waste oil needs a sustainable solution for effective management and protection of the environment. Treatment of used lubricant oil is one of the simplest routes to discard polluted materials from waste oil. Over the decades, researchers have investigated several reported methods for refining used lubricant oil. Meanwhile, Adsorption is an effective pre-treatment strategy for preliminary purification of used lubricant oil. Conducting polymers (CPs) have attracted a lot of attention due to its unique electronic and optical properties. In this review, various types of conducting polymer based adsorbents are discussed to remove impure toxic materials from any type of aqueous solution. Thus, the main purpose of this review is to explore how conducting polymer and its composites can use for refining used lubricant oil. Waste lubricating oil can be pretreated in advance by filtering it via a column packed with conducting polymer-based clay composites.Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Kaan			The distribution and role of nanoclay in lignocellulose-polymer blends	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							WOOD-PLASTIC COMPOSITES; BIOMASS; MATRIX; HDPE	Lignocellulose-polymer blends (LCPBs), particularly those manufactured from wood biomass and recycled plastics, have gained significance as a green alternative to concrete and wood. In the present work, we investigate the mechanisms as to how nanoclay additives improve water-sorption resistance and durability in LCPBs. The microstructure of our extruded and molded clay-redcedar-polyethylene blends are imaged by micro-computed tomography (m-CT), a promising technique for the characterization of composites. This recent and powerful 3D micro-imaging technique allows noninvasive revelation of the macroscopic to microscopic interactions between different components in a composite. Specifically, our m-CT study reveals the smearing of clay nanoplatelets over the lignocellulose domains with partial impregnation into the lignocellulose void network. The m-CT images also suggest partial disintegration of wood cellular structure in clay-added LCPBs. We attribute this modification to penetration of organocations from clay to lignocellulose, as validated by vibrational spectroscopy. To gain further insight, we also monitor the water-sorption kinetics. The kinetics revalidates the well-established role of clay in impeding water's diffusion. In addition, our analysis of the kinetics reveals a novel role of clay in water-sorption resistance. The clay, smeared over hygroscopic lignocellulose particles serves as a sealant and blocks the entry of water.	[Karumuri, Sriharsha; Kalkan, A.

Characterization of Fibers Obtained from Shredded Tires	JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE			English	Article						fibers; polyamide; thermal properties; pyrolisis	DIFFERENTIAL SCANNING CALORIMETRY; PRODUCTS; DEGRADATION; POLYMERS	The importance of recovering waste materials generated by industrialised societies is mainly due to the environmental impact they have, and one of the principal problem areas is tires. In recent years, an enormous amount of tires have been recycled. Metals contained in them have been recovered and the tire particles have been used in diverse applications. A third material that appears in the recovery process is the fibers, which act as reinforcement. Before addressing the possible reuse of these fibers, it is necessary to characterise and identify them. The diverse techniques of thermal analysis allow these fibers to be identified through melt point analysis, the results of which show the presence of polyamide 6 and 6.6. Moreover, the combination of pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry corroborates the identification made with the techniques previously mentioned and also indicates the presence of certain additives used in the manufacture of tires, such as resorcinol and benzothiazole.

J	Nekhamanurak, B				Nekhamanurak, Bawornkit			Property improvement of processed PLA/PBAT using chain extenders	MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS			English	Article						chain extenders; reprocessing; thermal properties; mechanical properties; viscosity	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; POLY(LACTIC ACID); THERMAL-STABILITY; BLENDS; POLYMER; PBAT; PLA	The polymer blend of poly(lactic acid)/poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PLA/PBAT), commercially named Ecovio, is a biodegradable plastic with a high level of strength and toughness. Despite the development of biodegradable plastics with improved characteristics and greater applicability, their cost remains prohibitively high preventing their widespread use. One approach to reducing production costs is recycling manufactured waste plastics. However, in this process, the properties of plastic are typically changed due to chain scissions during thermal reprocessing. Using an additive such as a chain extender is thought to reconnect cleaved polymer chains. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to investigate the influences of two chain extenders, multifunctional epoxide and multifunctional imide, on the mechanical properties and thermal properties as well as the melt flow rate of Ecovio. Materials were processed and blended using a twin-screw extruder and formed into film samples via the blow film extrusion process. The findings revealed that the addition of chain extenders resulted in a higher viscosity of Ecovio. In the thermal properties test, it was found that the use of chain extenders resulted in shifts in the glass transition, crystallization, melting temperature, and thermal stability of Ecovio. Finally, the result of mechanical properties test illustrated that Young's modulus and tensile strength of thermal processed Ecovio were changed and improved by blending with virgin Ecovio and chain extenders.

No 18455 and FCM substance No 01014. According to the applicant, the two substances are used together as a chain extender for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) to increase the molecular weight of the polymer after recycling. Final articles are intended for contact with all types of foodstuffs for long-term storage at room temperature, with-or without prior pasteurisation at up to 70 degrees C. Specific migration tests for TEOS and HMDS were not performed. Instead, the residual content of the substances in a recycled PET polymer manufactured with the modifier mixture was determined. The substances were not detected at detection levels up to 4 mu g/6 dm(2), supporting that the substances react completely with the PET chains. In a migration study, a recycled PET modified using the mixture was compared with virgin PET. All detected migrating substances corresponded to oligomers identical to those from the virgin PET, at a detection level estimated to be 3 mu g/kg. Based on the toxicological data provided, the CEF Panel concluded that there is no indication of a genotoxic potential for TEOS. HMDS was evaluated in 2007 by the EFSA Scientific Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Materials in Contact with Food (AFC). As HMDS is rapidly converted into hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) in humid air or aqueous media, the genotoxic potential of HMDS is covered by the genotoxicity data for HMDSO. The AFC Panel concluded that HMDSO was non-genotoxic. The CEF Panel concluded therefore that the mixture composed of TEOS and HMDS in a ratio of 97: 3 does not raise a safety concern for the consumer if it is used at up to 0.12% (w/w) for the production of recycled PET.

J	Chaudhary, R; Upadhyaya, S; Sangal, VK				Chaudhary, Ritu; Upadhyaya, Sushant; Sangal, Vikas Kumar			A Parametric Study on the HDPE/PP and Marble Slurry Waste Utilisation Using Single Screw Extruder	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION			English	Article						Extrusion; recycling; HDPE; air pollution; marble slurry; water pollution	PLASTICS; MANAGEMENT	Due to the increased socio-economic development, the manufacturing of different products based on various polymers for different applications such as space crafts, airplanes, automobiles, boats, and sports equipment are increasing continuously. This huge increase in solid polymer commodities is also creating the extravagant quantity of solid waste polymers (SWPs) due to their non-degradable characteristics. These SWPs, for example, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and nylon, etc., are used frequently in various applications and create new challenges to the industries, government, as well as end-users for systematic waste recycling/recovery in an eco-friendly manner. Moreover, in this modernisation era, almost all marble industries are also facing a huge problem as marble slurry (MS) yields a great burden not only due to its limited degradability characteristics but also wider environmental hazard towards water bodies, and rivers. Fine particles in the range size of 45-300 micron in the MS create air pollution which in turn increases breathing problems. Moreover, it also creates an ecological adverse impact on soil fertility and reduces the percolation rate of rain water which in turn reduces the recharging of groundwater. Therefore, keeping in view the above facts, the simultaneous recycling of HDPE, PP and marble slurry is adopted through single screw extrusion in order to reduce the burden on the environment. Moreover, the effect of various process parameters viz barrel temperature, screw speed (rpm), feed composition, and grain size of PP and HDPE on extrudate output was envisaged. It was found that the extrudate output increases steeply on increasing the average barrel temperature from 100 to 120 degrees C and linearly with screw speed range from 65 to 85 rpm. The effect of grain size had shown decreasing trend in throughput whereas on increasing the polymer content in the feed, throughput was found to be enhanced. Additives such as HPMC were found to be effective when used in synergy with HDPE and PP along with MS. The extrudate throughput was found to be a maximum of 33.01 g/minute at 120 degrees C, 85 screw rpm, 1.40-grain size underfeed with equal proportionate of HDPE/PP with 2% HPMC and 8% MS. This clearly opens the ways for proper utilization of HDPE, PP and MS waste by extrusion and provides the environmental protection solution by utilizing these polluted materials in the fabrication of value-added products through extrusion.

J	Abhilash; Inamdar, I				Abhilash; Inamdar, Isiri			Recycling of plastic wastes generated from COVID-19: A comprehensive illustration of type and properties of plastics with remedial options	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						Plastics; Types; Current methods; Microbial route; Life cycle assessment	DENSITY POLYETHYLENE; MANAGEMENT; DEGRADATION; BIODEGRADATION; INCINERATION; MECHANISMS; ADDITIVES; EFFICACY; QUALITY; ENERGY	Plastic has contributed enormously to the healthcare sector and towards public health safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the frequent usage of plastic-based personal protective equipment (PPEs) (including face masks, gloves, protective body suits, aprons, gowns, face shields, surgical masks, and goggles), by frontline health workers, there has been a tremendous increase in their manufacture and distribution. Different types of plastic polymers are used in the manufacture of this equipment, depending upon their usage. However, since a majority of these plastics are still single-use plastics (SUP), they are not at all eco-friendly and end up generating large quantities of plastic waste. The overview presents the various available and practiced methods in vogue for disposal cum treatment of these highly contaminated plastic wastes. Among the current methods of plastic waste disposal, incineration and land filling are the most common ones, but both these methods have their negative impacts on the environment. Alongside, numerous methods that can be used to sterilize them before any treatment have been discussed. There are several new sorting technologies, to help produce purer polymers that can be made to undergo thermal or chemical treatments. Microbial degradation is one such novel method that is under the spotlight currently and being studied extensively, because of its ecological advantages, cost-effectiveness, ease of use, and maintenance. In addition to the deliberations on the methods, strategies have been enumerated for combination of different methods, vis-a-vis studying the life cycle assessment towards a more circular economy in handling this menace to protect mankind.

This study aims to recycle plastic waste by manufacturing wood-plastic composites and to improve its mechanical properties by using additives, coupling agents, and lubricants. These composites are prepared by mixing 40-70% of wood flour with 20-25% of a polymer matrix. Wood was degraded at 220 & DEG;C, and then the composites were processed at 50 & DEG;C. The manufacturing process carried out in the study involved wood waste meshing, drying, shredding, drying, trimming, filling, blending, compounding, and extrusion moulding. The compounding of composites was accomplished in twin-screw extruders. Once the mixture was uniformly mixed, its final shape was given by a two-step extrusion moulding. Previously, researchers aimed at enhancing the mechanical properties of the composites, but our research focus was to improve their durability for different industrial applications. The results suggest that the impact strength is 17 MPa with 50% of wood powder ratio while the maximum value for the tensile strength is 32.5 MPa. About 50% of an increase in wood powder resulted in 8.1% bending strength increase from 26.1 to 32.8 MPa. Reducing the plastic matrix and the wood-particles water swelling ratio resulted in better mechanical properties. The wood species also affected the mechanical properties with their excellent dimensional stability and less variability. A high proportion of wood fibre tends to increase its steady-state torque and viscosity. The mechanical properties against different wood-flour proportions indicate that composite materials exhibit superior water swelling behaviour and extrusion quality.

An associated company has developed plastic concrete made from reused unrecyclable plastic waste. Its intended use is as a construction material. Design/methodology/approach The concrete mix, called PolyBet, composed of polypropylene and glass sand, is printed by the fused deposition modelling process. The process of material and parameter selection is described. The mechanical properties of the filled material were compared to its cast state. Samples were made from castings and two different orientations of 3D-printed parts. Three-point flex tests were carried out, and the area of the break was examined. Computed tomography of the samples was carried out. Findings The influence of the 3D printing process on the material was evaluated. The mechanical performance of the longitudinal samples was close to the cast state. There was a difference in the failure mode between the states, with cast parts exhibiting a tougher behaviour, with fractures propagating in a stair-like manner. The 3D-printed samples exhibited high degrees of porosity. Originality/value The results suggest that the novel material is a good fit for 3D printing, with little to no degradation caused by the process. Layer adhesion was shown to be excellent, with negligible effect on the finished part for the longitudinal orientation. That means, if large-scale testing of buildability is successful, the material is a good fit for additive manufacturing of building components and other large-scale structures.

Plastic packaging is diverse and made of multiple polymers and numerous additives, along with other components, such as adhesives or coatings. Further, packaging can contain residues from substances used during manufacturing, such as solvents, along with non-intentionally added substances (NIAS), such as impurities, oligomers, or degradation products. To characterize risks from chemicals potentially released during manufacturing, use, disposal, and/or recycling of packaging, comprehensive information on all chemicals involved is needed. Here, we present a database of Chemicals associated with Plastic Packaging (CPPdb), which includes chemicals used during manufacturing and/or present in final packaging articles. The CPPdb lists 906 chemicals likely associated with plastic packaging and 3377 substances that are possibly associated. Of the 906 chemicals likely associated with plastic packaging, 63 rank highest for human health hazards and 68 for environmental hazards according to the harmonized hazard classifications assigned by the European Chemicals Agency within the Classification, Labeling and Packaging (CLP) regulation implementing the United Nations' Globally Harmonized System (GHS). Further, 7 of the 906 substances are classified in the European Union as persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT), or very persistent, very bioaccumulative (vPvB), and 15 as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC). Thirty-four of the 906 chemicals are also recognized as EDC or potential EDC in the recent EDC report by the United Nations Environment Programme. The identified hazardous chemicals are used in plastics as monomers, intermediates, solvents, surfactants, plasticizers, stabilizers, biocides, flame retardants, accelerators, and colorants, among other functions. Ourwork was challenged by a lack of transparency and incompleteness of publicly available information on both the use and toxicity of numerous substances. The most hazardous chemicals identified here should be assessed in detail as potential candidates for substitution. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Ceramic and porcelain goods are produced from natural materials containing a high proportion of clay minerals. And waste insulator can be used as an active additive thanks to their pozzolanic properties, or as recycled aggregate in the manufacture of mortars and concrete. This research studied the effect of different particle size of grinding waste insulator proportions on binder in cement mortar Experiments were conducted to determine the optimal replacement content and particle type to ensure that the quality of concrete products is maintained. The results indicate that the use of grinding insulator powder as an admixture for cement mortar was efficient in increasing compressive strength, workability and in reducing alkali silica reaction expansion clue to the increased amount of calcium silicate hydrates created by pozzolanic reaction. And it was apparent that the properties of mortar were different with particle size of grinding insulator powder. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A semi-batch 2 L autoclave was used, with hydrogen continuously bubbled through a slurry of rubber crumbs and a paraffinic dissolution oil under pressures from 300 to 1500 psig and temperatures of about 400 degrees C. The dissolution oil dissolved the rubber and allowed the carbon-black particles to be freed from the polymer matrix. The carbon black then acted as a hydrogenation/cracking catalyst. Under optimal reaction conditions, the yield of carbon black + inorganic additives was approximately 36%, the gas yield 1-2%, naphtha yield 8%, and the balance a product oil, part of which can be recycled as the dissolution reagent. The carbon-black product after filtering and drying had properties which were an average of those of the various grades added during tire manufacture. One-half of the inorganics could be removed by a simple acid wash if desired. The carbon black has a value more than twice that of the other products and could be the factor which would allow this process to be economically viable without subsidies.

They offer easy processing, fulfill technological, functional and durability requirements at the same time ensuring increased bio-compatibility, recycling, and eventually lower cost. On the other hand, optical 3D printing (O3DP) is a rapid prototyping tool (and an additive manufacturing technique) being developed as a choice for efficient and low waste production method, yet currently associated with mainly petroleum-derived resins. Here we employ a single bio-based resin derived from soy beans, suitable for O3DP in the scales from nano- to macro-dimensions, which can be processed even without the addition of photoinitiator. The approach is validated using both state-of-the art laser nanolithography setup as well as a widespread table-top 3D printer - sub-micrometer accuracy 3D objects are fabricated reproducibly. Additionally, chess-like figures are made in an industrial line commercially delivering small batch production services. Such concept is believed to make a breakthrough in rapid prototyping by switching the focus of O3DP to bio-based resins instead of being restricted to conventional petroleum-derived photopolymers.

FUEL; RENEWABLE ENERGY; LAND-USE; ELECTRICITY-GENERATION; LEVELIZED COST; LEARNING-CURVE; PARTIAL SHADE; SOLAR; POLYMER	There is an intense need to optimize agrivoltaic systems. This article describes the invention of a new testing system: the parametric open source cold-frame agrivoltaic system (POSCAS). POSCAS is an adapted gardening cold-frame used in cold climates as it acts as a small greenhouse for agricultural production. POSCAS is designed to test partially transparent solar photovoltaic (PV) modules targeting the agrivoltaic market. It can both function as a traditional cold frame, but it can also be automated to function as a full-service greenhouse. The integrated PV module roof can be used to power the controls or it can be attached to a microinverter to produce power. POSCAS can be placed in an experimental array for testing agricultural and power production. It can be easily adapted for any type of partially transparent PV module. An array of POSCAS systems allows for the testing of agrivoltaic impacts from the percent transparency of the modules by varying the thickness of a thin film PV material or the density of silicon-based cells, and various forms of optical enhancement, anti-reflection coatings and solar light spectral shifting materials in the back sheet. All agrivoltaic variables can be customized to identify ideal PV designs for a given agricultural crop.

Additionally, mechanical performance of the materials was studied. The VOCs were identified by collecting air samples with Tenax (R) TA tubes and analyzing them with a GC-MS system. UFP concentrations were monitored with a portable ultrafine particle counter. Total VOC emissions of all materials were reduced by 28-68% after 5 thermal cycles (TCs). However, slight accumulation of 1,4-dioxane was observed with poly(lactic acid) materials. UFP emissions were reduced by 45-88% for 3D printing grade materials over 5 TCs but increased by 62% in the case of a waste plastic material over 3 TCs. The mechanical performance of the materials was investigated by measuring their tensile strengths (TSs) and elastic moduli (EM) with an axial-torsion testing system. The reprocessed materials expressed fluctuations in their 3D printing qualities and mechanical performances. The mechanical performances were observed to reduce only slightly after 5 TCs, and the trend was observable only after the data was mass-normalized. The TSs of the samples were reduced by 10-24%, while the EM were reduced by 1-9% after 5 TCs. The TS and EM of one material were increased by 14 and 33%, respectively. In conclusion, recycled polymers are plausible 3D printing feedstock alternatives as they possess acceptable mechanical performance and low emittance according to this study. Furthermore, non-3D printing grade polymers may be applied in a 3D printer with caution.

J	Butylina, S; Martikka, O; Karki, T				Butylina, Svetlana; Martikka, Ossi; Karki, Timo			Effects of water immersion-freeze-thaw cycling on the properties of wood-polypropylene composites containing pigments	PIGMENT & RESIN TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Physical properties of materials; Pigments; Wood-polymer composites; Residual flexural strength; Colour change; Polypropylene; Thickness swelling	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; POLYMER COMPOSITES; PROCESSING METHOD; FLOUR; DURABILITY; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR; SURFACE	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the effects of water immersion-freeze-thaw treatment on the physical properties, flexural strength (FS) and morphology of wood-polypropylene composites containing pigments. Design/methodology/approach - Wood-polypropylene composites containing brown, green and grey pigments were compounded in a conical twin-screw extruder. A composite manufactured without any pigment addition was used as a reference. The amount of pelletized wood, polypropylene and coupling agent (MAPP) was kept constant. The moisture content thickness swelling (TS), FS and surface colour of the composites were measured before and after water immersion-freeze-thaw cycling. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the morphology of the composites. Findings - FS and dimensional stability were reduced after exposure to water immersion-freeze-thaw cycling for all composites. The surface properties (colour and roughness) of the composites also changed after exposure to water immersion-freeze-thaw cycling. The degree of change depended on the presence of pigment and the type of polypropylene (neat or recycled), however. Research limitations/implications - This study is a part of an ongoing study on weathering of wood-polymer composites (WPC) containing different additives. The results of this study were obtained from accelerated laboratory experiments. Practical implications - Inorganic pigments are widely used as additives in plastics, because they have an excellent UV absorption, good IR-reflective properties and heat stability. The research revealed that metal-containing pigments had an effect on degradation in quality of wood-polypropylene composites exposed to water immersion-freeze-thaw cyclic treatment. The addition of metal-containing pigments to composite formulation resulted in a higher susceptibility of wood-polypropylene composites to water absorption, and as a consequence to a higher drop of FS compared to composites made without pigment. The polymer matrix plays an important role in the protection of WPC against weathering. Originality/value - This paper will help in understanding possible problems in the durability of wood-polypropylene composites compounded with metal-based pigments when they are exposed to water immersion-freeze-thaw cyclic treatment.

In the sector of alcoholic beverages and, in particular, of wine, plastic bottles are used sporadically. Glass bottles or other economic solutions such as laminated cardboard containers or so-called bag-in-boxes are regularly preferred. However, the high ease of use, lightness, recyclability and low cost of plastic materials are the main reasons that are fueling interest especially in wine producers. Poly (ethylene terephthalate) bottles have recently been introduced to the market, although their success has been limited by poor gas impermeability and above all by their recognized high environmental footprint. Barrier can be improved by oxygen scavenger and plasma coating. Environmental footprint is rather low when recycled but that is not well possible with scavenger. Bioplastic materials offer an interesting alternative to fossil-based plastics, combining most of their technical advantages with a lower environmental impact. However, they are more expensive and complex to process. In addition, mechanical and barrier properties are often less than for conventional polymers. In this work, therefore, the development of bioplastic bottles with low gas permeation by stretch blow molding was studied. Poly (lactic acid)-polybutylene succinate blends have been modified by adding additives that obstruct the passage of gaseous molecules through the wall of the bottle. The studies have in particular concerned the extrusion and characterization of bioplastic compounds, the injection molding of preforms, and the blowing of bottles. The results obtained showed that it is possible to obtain low permeation bioplastic bottles, which are an ecological alternative to conventional solutions for packaging.

It is common practice in industry to process a mix of recycled and virgin PA12 powder; however it is not yet fully understood how the Laser Sintering process parameters influence the microstructural composition for this mixture, namely the degree of crystallinity, the porosity characteristics and the distribution of the pores within the sintered parts. In this work X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) is used to investigate the porosity of tensile bars printed flatwise using a 50/50 mix of used and virgin PA12 processed with different Laser Sintering energy densities (EDs). Analysis of the pores characteristics and image processing of the CT-slices parallel to the building platform provide insights into the link between Laser Sintering process parameters, pores formation and their arrangement into the sintered polymer for different energy density levels. This information combined with the crystallinity values measured by Differential Scanning Calorimetry, gives a complete picture of the microstructure of the sintered material and its link with the resulting tensile properties.

J	Sambucci, M; Valente, M				Sambucci, Matteo; Valente, Marco			Influence of Waste Tire Rubber Particles Size on the Microstructural, Mechanical, and Acoustic Insulation Properties of 3D-Printable Cement Mortars	CIVIL ENGINEERING JOURNAL-TEHRAN			English	Article						3D Printing; Tire Recycling; Rubber Particle Size; Print Quality; Microstructural Investigation; Mechanical Properties; Sound Insertion Loss	CRUMB RUBBER; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; CONCRETE; PERFORMANCE; AGGREGATE; GLASS	3D printing technologies of construction materials are gaining ground in the building industry. As well documented in the literature, these advanced manufacturing methodologies aim to reduce work-related injuries and materials waste, enhancing architectural flexibility which would enable more sophisticated designs for engineering and aesthetic purposes. In this framework, the development of functional and eco-sustainable printable materials represents an extremely attractive challenge for research, promoting digital fabrication to reach its maximum cost-effective and technological potentials. The use of recycled tire rubber particles in 3D printable Portland-based compounds is an exclusive contribution in this field. This line of research aims to integrate the well-known engineering performances of rubber-cement materials with the advanced peculiarities of additive manufacturing methodologies. As an innovative contribution, the authors propose here a detailed study on the possible relationship between rubber particle size and technological properties of the 3D printable mix. Specifically, two groups of continuous size grading polymer aggregates (0-1 mm rubber powder and 1-3 mm rubber granules as fine and coarse fractions, respectively) were analyzed in terms of impact on rheology, print quality, microstructure, mechanical properties, and acoustic insulation performance. Concerning the print quality, rubber aggregates altered the fluidity of the fresh mix, improving the adhesion between the printed layers and therefore enhancing the mechanical isotropy in the post-hardening sample. A remarkable influence of the rubber gradation on the compounds' behaviour was found in hardened properties. By comparing the rubberized compounds, the fine polymer fraction shows greater interfacial cohesion with the cement paste. However, more significant mechanical strength loss was found due to a greater reduction in density and increased porosity degree. On the other hand, mortars doped with larger rubber particles tend to have a higher unit weight, finest pore distribution, minor mechanical strength drop, and higher ductility but worse interface binding with the matrix. Regarding the acoustic insulation properties, a proper balance between rubber powder and granules in the mixes allows to obtain comparable/superior performance compared to plain mortar but the effect of the aggregate size is strongly dependent on the sound frequency range investigated. Future findings revolve around applicability studies of these formulations in civil and architectural fields, benefiting from the design flexibility of 3D printing.

It is based on primary data from environmental emissions, wastewater, chemical components, and manufacturing of PIL based devices. The results indicate that the printing process does not significantly exacerbate the environmental impacts. However, it is shown that excellent opportunities for further mitigation of the life cycle impacts of PILs can be realised are by practising reagent recovery, which reduces the amount of reagents emitted as waste, and by reduction/recycling of solvents used for cleaning the 3D part. The major impact contributor in the 3D-printing of PILs is the synthesis of the IL monomers. The effective reduction of solvent consumption and recovery significantly improves the impact of the synthetic process. This work focuses on the employment of the 3-butyl-l-vinylimidazolium [BVim] cation, with the non-coordinating and hydrophobic bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide [NTf2](-) anion as the counter anion. The polymerisable monomer IL has comparable impact compared to the analogous non-polymerisable 3-butyl-l-methylimidazolium [NTf2]ionic liquid, thus potentially allowing for the more efficient use of the ionic liquid properties by immobilization in solid phases. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that switching the anion from [NTf2]-to dicyanamide [N(CN2)](-) significantly decreases the impacts in all categories evaluated for PIL production. This work represents the first phase toward quantitative LCA data generation for the process of 3D-printing ionic liquids, which will be great support for decision making during design of PIL 3D-printing processes at a laboratory scale.

Life cycle assessment of the application of nanoclays in wire coating	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON STRUCTURAL NANO COMPOSITES (NANOSTRUC 2012)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Structural Nano Composites (NANOSTRUC)	JUL 02-04, 2012	Cranfield Univ, ENGLAND	Nephh, Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), Ecoshell, Agilent Technologies, JM Bioconnect, Eaton, Gerhardt, Fritsch, Nanotechnol Knowledge Transfer Network, Nanotechnol Ind Assoc (NIA), Amer Elements, Cranfield Nano	Cranfield Univ			A life cycle assessment (LCA) is carried out to compare nanoclay-reinforced polymer wire coatings with conventional ones. While the conventional wire coatings contain standard halogen free retardants, in reinforced coatings, montmorillonite (nanoclay) is incorporated into electric cable linings as a rheological agent for an increased resistance to fire. In addition, a reduced load of standard halogen free retardants is obtained. The synergistic effect of the montmorillonite on traditional flame retardant additives (by the formation of a three-dimensional char network) can lead to a revolution in wire production. The application of nanoclays contributes also to anti-dripping effect and flexibility increase [1]. Some producers have already started commercializing wire with nanotechnology-based coating; in the short term the use of nanoclay in wire coating production will probably reach a significant market share replacing traditional formulations. The main aim of this study is to compare the environmental impacts along the life cycle of a traditional wire coating (mineral flame retardants like ATH or MDH in a polymer matrix) with the nanoclay-reinforced wire coating, where the montmorillonite replaces a low percentage of the mineral flame retardant. The system boundaries of the study include the following unit processes: nanoclay production, thermoplastic material and mineral flame retardants production, cable coating manufacturing by extrusion and different end of life scenarios (recycling, incineration and landfill disposal). Whereas nanoreinforced composites have shown and increased fire retardance, the addition of nanomaterials seems to have no significant relevance in the environmental assessment. However, the lack of nano-specific characterization factors for nanomaterials and emission rates associated to the different life cycle stages - mainly in the extrusion and use phase, where accidental combustions can take place-still remains a challenge for realistic life cycle assessment modelling.

Unprecedented high catalytic activities (TOF = 42530 h(-1)) have been achieved by waterdispersible ruthenium nanoparticles (RuNPs) stabilized by a broad spectrum of water-soluble polymers with both oxygen-containing functionalities such as the non-toxic and inexpensive polyethylene glycol (PEG) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and with polymers bearing nitrogen-groups in the hydrogenation of LA to obtain with high selectivities (99.2 mol%) GVL in the aqueous medium. Furthermore, water provides for a desired higher dispersion of RuNPs catalysts capable to achieve high activities and impressive stabilities. The calculated apparent activation energy of the RuNPs/PEG catalyst amounts a low value of 32.3 kJ/mol. TEM investigations revealed the formation of RuNPs/PVA catalysts with a small average particle size diameter of 2.8 +/- 0.1 nm which is consistent with the high catalytic activities. Recycling experiments have shown that the RuNPs/PVA catalyst demonstrated superb stability and selectivity in five consecutive runs at a high molar ratio LA/Ru = 16000 which is of industrial interest.

Impact of Process Variables of Acetone Vapor Jet Drilling on Surface Roughness and Circularity of 3D-Printed ABS Parts: Fabrication and Studies on Thermal, Morphological, and Chemical Characterizations	POLYMERS			English	Article						additive manufacturing; acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; chemical vapor jet drilling; surface roughness and circularity; SEM analysis; DSC analysis; FTIR analysis; L-9 Taguchi orthogonal array	METAL-MATRIX COMPOSITES; PROCESS PARAMETERS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; OPTIMIZATION; MACHINABILITY; POLYMERS; BEHAVIOR	Ever since the introduction of 3D printing, industries have seen an exponential growth in production and efficiency. Three-dimensional printing is the process of additive manufacturing (AM) in which the conventional method of material removal is challenged. Layer-on-layer deposition is the basic principle of the AM. Additive manufacturing technologies are used to create 3D-printed objects. An object is built in an additive technique by laying down successive layers of material until the object is complete. Each of these layers can be viewed as a cross-section of the item that has been lightly cut. When compared to traditional production methods, 3D printing allows the creation of complicated shapes with less material. In conventional methods, the materials go through several damages due to the tool-workpiece contact creating friction between them and the dissipated heat that damages the material. Overcoming the conventional method of machining with the help of 3D printing is a new advancement in the industries. The process involves using non-conventional methods for the machining of the parts. This research was oriented towards the chemical vapor jet drilling of the acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) materials. ABS materials are highly machinable and can be recycled for further usage. This paper focused on the usage of acetone as the chemical for drilling. The surface roughness and circularity of the drilled hole was taken into account for this research paper. We set up a manual experiment to run tests and get results. A vapor jet machine was designed with acetone as the core for the vapor. Various analyses were also formulated and conducted during experimentations. Surface roughness analysis provided the insight of roughness after the machining with the help of acetone vapor jet spray. SEM and micro-image parameters were also considered for more clear and advanced reports. In this research paper, DSC and FTIR analysis were performed to understand changes in the internal structure and the material properties of the ABS. Moreover, the research aimed to investigate the effect of various inputs processing parameters such as pressure, flow rate, and stand-off distance on the surface roughness and circularity of ABS workpiece material. The Taguchi L-9 orthogonal array design was utilized to conduct tests by chemical vapor jet drilling using acetone and to evaluate the performance of the set-up while reducing the influence of interfering factors in order to provide reliable surface finish and circularity results. The results and conclusion of the research paper aimed to determine the most suitable parameters for the non-conventional acetone vapor jet drilling of the ABS material. The theoretical calculations predicted 1.64432 and 0.3289080 values of surface roughness and circularity, respectively. On the other hand, the experimental values were recorded as 1.598 for surface roughness and 0.322 for circularity. Therefore, a negligible error of 0.046 for surface roughness and 0.0031 for circularity, respectively, was noted which validate the statistical equations and the consistency of the combined vapor jet drilling process.

The key factor is the aging mechanism of powder during the layer-wise infrared radiation process of laser powder bed fusion. Therefore, the evolution of physico-chemical structure under different infrared radiation temperatures is thoroughly studied in this paper, and the aging mechanism is proposed for polyetheretherketone powder. On the one hand, the layer-wise infrared radiation can promote the spheroidization of particle edges and corners, and the fusion of slits inside the powder. Meanwhile, more ordered crystalline structure, smaller interplanar spacing, and reduced lattice volume emerge with the deepening of powder aging. The sintering window is widened accompanied by the disappearance of the exothermic peak. On the other hand, although the chain does not break after aging, the macromolecular has been cross-linked to form a biphenyl structure, which can directly reduce the crystallinity of polyetheretherketone powder. This research is of guiding significance for the development of anti-aging polyetheretherketone powder and the consistent powder management of laser powder bed fusion. (c) 2021 The Authors.

A new series of polyamide elastomers was synthesized using a bio-based dimer diamine monomer as a building block to copolymerize with aminocaproic acid and adipic acid through step-growth polymerization, followed by supercritical CO2 foaming for the fabrication of microcellular foams. The introduction of the branched-structured dimer diamine monomer effectively restricted the molecular packing and hydrogen bonding density of the polyamide system, leading to numerous small crystals acting as nucleation sites for heterogeneous cell nucleation. Simultaneously, the branched long chains of the dimer diamine formed chain entanglement networks, which increased the material melt strength against the elongational stresses of cell growth. The synergistic effect provided by dimer diamine led to the successful manufacture of foamed samples with a high expansion ratio and robust dimensional stability, effectively overcoming the foaming difficulties of high crystallinity and insufficient melt strength in traditional polyamide 6 (PA6). In addition, this polyamide elastomer foam system could be recycled and reprocessed due to the advantages of non-crosslinking and additive-free. Therefore, the study's findings constitute a promising direction for the usage of renewable sources in the development of foamable polyamide materials for sustainable applications in the plastics industry.

Impact damage resistance of 3D printed continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites using fused deposition modelling	COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING			English	Article						3D printing; Fused deposition modelling; Continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites; Impact strength; Failure analysis	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; CHARPY IMPACT; STACKING-SEQUENCE; CONTINUOUS CARBON; PROCESS PARAMETERS; BEHAVIOR; PLA; POLYMERS; STRENGTH; PREDICTION	Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is a promising additive manufacturing technology and an alternative of conventional processes for the fabrication of fibre reinforced composites due to its ability to build functional parts having complex geometries. Continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRTPCs) are becoming more significant in industrial applications due to their inherit advantages such as excellent mechanical performance, recycling and potential lightweight structures [1,2]. However, a major concern affecting the efficient use of 3D printed composites is the effect of impact damage on the structural integrity, compared to conventional pre-preg composites. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of build orientation, layer thickness and fibre volume content on the impact performance of 3D printed continuous carbon, glass, and Kevlar fibre reinforced nylon composites, manufactured by FDM technique. Charpy impact tests are carried out to determine impact strength. SEM images of fractured surfaces are examined to assess failure mechanics of the different configurations. It is observed that the effect of layer thickness of nylon samples on the impact performance was different for flat and on-edge samples. Impact strength increases as layer thickness increases in flat samples but, conversely, it decreases in on-edge samples, depicting a more brittle fracture. In addition, the results show that impact strength increases as fibre volume content increases in most cases. Glass fibre reinforced samples exhibits the highest impact strength and carbon fibre reinforced samples the lowest one and similar to nylon performance. Furthermore, on-edge reinforced samples exhibit higher values of impact strength than flat reinforced samples. Finally, the results obtained demonstrate that impact strength exhibited by 3D printed composites are significantly higher than the usual 3D printed thermoplastics and, in some cases, even better than common pre-preg materials.

J	La Guardia, MJ; Hale, RC; Newman, B				La Guardia, Mark J.; Hale, Robert C.; Newman, Brent			Brominated Flame-Retardants in Sub-Saharan Africa: Burdens in Inland and Coastal Sediments in the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality, South Africa	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS; E-WASTE; PBDES; SAMPLES; HBCDS; CHINA; RIVER	Brominated flame-retardant (BFR) additives are present in many polymeric consumer products at percent levels. High environmental concentrations have been observed near cities and polymer, textile, and electronics manufacturing centers. Most studies have focused on European, North American, and Asian locales. Releases are likely rising most dramatically in countries with weak environmental and human health regulation and enforcement, demand for electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) is escalating, and importation of waste EEE occurs. Several African countries meet these criteria, but little data are available on burdens or sources. To better understand the extent of BFR environmental dissemination in a southern African urban community, inland and coastal sediments were collected in the eThekwini metropolitan municipality, South Africa, and analyzed for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), 2-ethylhexyl 2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate (TBB), 2-ethylhexyl 2,3,4,5-tretabromophalate (TBPH), 1,2-bis (2,4,6-tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE), and decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE). BFRs were detected in all samples (n = 45). Concentration data are presented on total organic carbon (TOC) normalized basis. Sigma BFR ranged from 114 to 47 100 ng g(-1). Decabromodiphenyl ether was detected in 93% of samples (mean concentration 3208 ng g(-1)) followed by TBB at 91% (mean conc. 545 ng g(-1)). Durban Bay is strongly influenced by urban runoff and tidal hydrology, and sediments therein exhibited Sigma PBDE concentrations ranging from 1850 to 25 400 ng g(-1) (median conc. 3240 ng g(-1)). These levels rival those in the heavily impacted Pearl River Delta, China. BFRs likely enter the South African environment during manufacture of BFR-containing products, during and following product use (i.e., after disposal and as a result of materials recycling activities), and from nonpoint sources such as atmospheric fallout and urban runoff.

The overall mechanical properties of the composite material are controlled and tailored by varying the ratio of the primary constituents (postindustrial cellulose and bentonite clay). This grade of cellulose is no longer suitable for use in the manufacture of recycled paper products and, as such, it is considered a waste product. The described process repurposes this cellulose waste as a component in a structural element that can be worked using standard woodworking tools. The material's compressive strength ranges from approximately 338 psi (2.33 MPa) at low bentonite ratios (less than 50 % by mass) to approximately 1,015 psi (7.01 MPa) at higher bentonite ratios (greater than 60 % by mass). The higher bentonite ratio, Ratio B, has a compressive strength similar to that of a Class 2 burnt brick but does not require the material to be fired (i.e., a significant cost and energy savings). This material can be easily painted, stained, or surface-treated much like wood. However, unlike wood and other masonry products (e.g., concrete), it exhibits a failure mode more similar to that of a polymer where the material does not catastrophically fail rather it slowly yields and shows visible deformation. This mode of failure provides ample warning before a piece fails and gives time for it to be repaired or replaced before catastrophic failure. The material is also lighter and cheaper to produce than most competing products as one of its main components is a postindustrial waste product.

The objective of this resource assessment was to describe the state-level distribution, quantity and market value of lignocellulosic feedstocks for ethanol production in the United States. Lignocellulosic feedstocks, derived from plant materials, are composed primarily of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Cellulose and hemicellulose are polymers of simple sugars that can be chemically fermented to produce ethanol. Lignin plays a role in binding cellulose and hemicellulose together in plant cell walls. This study focused on lignocellulosic by-products of agriculture, food processing, forest products industry, and consumers. The United States generates 306 million metric tons (dry weight) of lignocellulosic materials annually that could be used to manufacture ethanol. The bulk of this potential feedstock supply is made up of agricultural residues left following crop harvesting, such as corn stover. Corn stover makes up 70 percent of the total biomass resource. If agricultural residues are used for ethanol production, the price paid for agricultural residues will have to meet or exceed their current soil nutrient and animal fodder values. Food processing residues such as corn gluten feed and meal, distillers' dried grains, and spent brewer's grains are used as animal feed additives, which makes them high in cost in relation to other feedstocks. Forest products residues are mostly used for fuel, pulp, animal bedding, or mulch. The unutilized portion of these residues may be available for ethanol production. Recycled paper, sugarcane bagasse, rice straw, paper sludge, and urban tree residue show potential for use as ethanol feedstocks due to their low cost.

J	Tebaldo, V; Faga, MG				Tebaldo, Vincenzo; Faga, Maria Giulia			Influence of the heat treatment on the microstructure and machinability of titanium aluminides produced by electron beam melting	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Titanium aluminide; Electron beam melting; Dry turning; Microstructure; Crystalline phases; Wear	WORKPIECE SURFACE INTEGRITY; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; TIAL ALLOY; GAMMA; TEMPERATURE; INTERMETALLICS; COMPONENTS; LIFE; DRY	Additive manufacturing (AM) has been emerging as a promising fabrication technology for polymers and metal products. This technology is able to fabricate complex shape components with high geometrical freedom and allows to reduce the overall waste material, as the powder can be recycled several times, and time from drawing to production can be consistently reduced. In the case of materials for aerospace applications, like TiAl alloys, conventional machining is needed to obtain the required surface finish. The machinability is strongly dependent on the specific alloys and on the production technology used, leading to different microstructures, that can be tuned undergoing the alloys to several treatments after the AM process. The paper focus on the effect of post processing treatment on hardness, structural properties and machinability of Ti48Al2Nb2Cr obtained by electron beam melting process. Untreated and heat treated alloys were considered. Turning tests were carried out under dry conditions by using cemented carbides cutting tools coated with TiCN-Al2O3-TiN. The structure, microstructure and hardness of the material were studied and related to machinability, that was evaluated in terms of tool life and surface integrity, focusing on both surface and sub-surface alterations. Tool wear, cutting forces, chip morphology and surface roughness were also analyzed. Adhesion prevailed on abrasion as main wear phenomenon, leading to cutting edge breaking. Results indicated a higher machinability of the alloys that underwent post processing treatment because of the different microstructure and crystalline phases induced. Indeed, c42 and f3 phases present in heat treated material enhanced the formation of built up edge, acting as protective layer and then slowing down the degradation phenomena. Also the lower porosity leaded to a lower diffusion phenomenon, positively affecting the tool life. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Volotskoy, A; Yurkin, Y; Avdonin, V				Volotskoy, Alexey; Yurkin, Yuriy; Avdonin, Valeriy			New Thermoplastic Damping Polymeric Materials Based on Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate	MATERIALE PLASTICE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Polymer Processing in Engineering (PPE) Conference	OCT 07-09, 2019	Galati, ROMANIA			Damping; Dynamic mechanical properties; Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA); Ethylenevinyl acetate (EVA); Elastic properties		This article is devoted to the problem of working out of damping polymer materials which are effective in the wide temperature and frequency range. In the modern world, work is being carried out to create damping polymer composite materials (DPM) from which it is possible to manufacture protective elements and parts of engineering structures of reduced vibration excitability. Existing DPM have a narrow temperature range, within which effective vibration absorption is observed, moreover, most of them go through a vulcanization stage, which increases the cost of the final product, has a harmful effect on environment and allows limited recycling of waste. One of the ways to solve this problem is to replace traditional rubber vibration-absorbing materials with thermo-elastoplasts (TEP). The most promising polymer for TEP is ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), which has high damping properties, oil resistance and relative incombustibility. In this regard, experimental studies were conducted to establish the patterns of influence of the type and concentration of structure-forming components (plasticizers, fillers, modifiers) on the dynamic mechanical properties of TEP based on EVA in order to develop a new DPM effective in a wide temperature range. The leading method to investigate this problem is a method of dynamic mechanical analysis which allows to get information about changes of mechanical characteristics under mechanical load and controlled temperature and frequency. With the help of detected patterns it was possible to determine type of plasticizer which significantly decreases glass temperature of EVA. The percentage ratio of EVA/ plasticizer system is stated, and the type of plasticizer at which the maximum of mechanical losses takes over greater values is accordingly detected. It is revealed, that to work out DPM on EVA basis, which are effective in wide temperature range it is more preferable to add not less than 40 % on volume basis inert fillers, such as talc or mica with addition of 5-10 % of carbon as the hardening additive. The kind of resin improving damping properties and raising rigidity of composites on EVA basis is defined. On the basis of the research, a material was developed which has the following properties: the maximum value of tan delta is at least 0.45 at a temperature of plus 5 degrees C (oscillation frequency 10 Hz); width of the temperature interval within which tan d is not less than 0.3 from minus 40 to plus 50 degrees. (oscillation frequency 10 Hz); conditional tensile strength of not less than 10 kg/cm(2), cold resistance up to minus 50 degrees C.

Consequently, the environmental and health issue related to ore extraction has led to an increased awareness of the importance of recovering mining sites. In this study, samples taken from tailings located in the abandoned metallic mine named La Union (Mazarambroz, Spain) have been studied to sinter lightweight aggregates (LWAs). The fraction <63 mu m was selected and mixed with 10 wt% of a sepiolite residue to gain plasticity. Likewise, 2.5 wt% of thermoplastic (P) and 2.5 wt% of carbon fiber (FC) wastes were added in powder form to check the effect of these two additives. The mixtures were blended with water, extruded, shaped into pellets, oven-dried and finally fired at 1175 degrees C for 4 min in a rotary kiln. The main technological properties of the aggregates related to bloating, density, porosity, loss on ignition, water absorption and mechanical strength were determined. Quantitative changes in mineralogy and glass formation were studied using the Rietveld refined XRD technique. Microstructural and textural characteristics were studied by microscopy. Dark color LWAs of high porosity, low density and good mechanical strength were obtained. The addition of Pad FC allowed the development of a well-distributed-porous core surrounded by a very thin shell, in contrast to the thick cortex formed when these components were not used. While the addition of FC did not mean real advantages in the technological properties, P promoted greater bloating and lower density. A high volume of glass was evolved in all the aggregates (>= 60%) and augite was the main neo-formed mineral. Pyrrotite was also neo-formed, but its proportion was negligible to be detected by XRD, so that it could be only observed by SEM-EDX microscopy. These results are encouraging to continue investigating these wastes and the aggregates manufactured from them in order to determine their capacity to immobilize hazardous metals and their potential application in lightweight concrete, agriculture or civil engineering.
