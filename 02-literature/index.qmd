## AIC Reading method

For screening read : **Title, Journal, keywords and Abstract**

For detailed synthesis use **AIC**:

- **Abstract â†’ Summary of the paper **

- **Introduction â†’ Context of problem and research, gap, summary of what is done**

- **Conclusions â†’ Summary of results and importance of results given the context.**

Report on your literature findings and beware of:

- Purposely misrepresenting the work of other authors. 

> **Plagiarism** â€“ the use of anotherâ€™s original words, arguments, or ideas as though they were your own, even if this is done in good faith, out of carelessness, or out of ignorance.

- Importance of the References .bg-yellow[(Act 03 we'll take a look)]
