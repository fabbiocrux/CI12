Engineer and PhD. I am a researcher that is passionate about human-centered design methods, innovation, technology and coffee (yes coffee!).

I have been interested in stakeholder's and user's integration during the entire design cycle as a way to improve a product's acceptability. Uncovering the need for tools to help designers and engineers to evaluate and measure the product's acceptability, I developed a method to estimate it early in the design process. This method, based on Bayesian networks, facilitates their decision-making and helps them in the evaluation of product improvement scenarios.
