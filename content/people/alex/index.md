Engineer and doctor in industrial engineering, my professional and research experiences are mainly focused on the digital tools of the different steps of the innovation and creativity process. I address the issues of preparation of the ideation phase, capitalization of knowledge from ideation to prototyping, visualization and prototyping of concepts.

I am interested in artificial intelligence technologies (ontology, machine learning, neural networks, optimization ...). I did my thesis in collaboration with Polytechnique Montréal on knowledge management during the collaborative process of creativity. 
I was a teacher-researcher at Arts et Métiers ParisTech but also responsible for NLP - ontologies in a private company. 
I am currently a researcher and the holder of an entrepreneurial project that valorizes my thesis work.
