High performance polymer nanocomposites for additive manufacturing applications	REACTIVE & FUNCTIONAL POLYMERS			English	Review						Additive manufacturing; High performance polymer; Nanocomposites; 3D printing; Rapid prototyping	WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; LASER; STEREOLITHOGRAPHY; DESIGN; FIBERS	Additive manufacturing (or 3D printing) involves the process of fabricating a part by layer-by-layer assembly of materials with processes such as extrusion, binding, melting, and photopolymerization. It is transforming how we assemble our prototypes and, in the future, manufacture our products. There have been a number of materials that can be utilized for this technology, however, high performance polymer nanocomposites are a very important class of material that is just recently being used in additive manufacturing. High performance polymer is a group of polymer materials that are known to retain its desirable mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties when subjected to harsh environment such as high temperature, high pressure, and corrosive chemicals. When mixed with nanofillers such as carbon nanotube, nanoclay, and graphene, these polymers can have improved mechanical properties and sometimes acquire properties that were not present initially like thermal and electrical conductivity. This review article aims to summarize available additive manufacturing techniques, high performance polymers and nanofillers available, and research efforts on its use for additive manufacturing.

Investigating the mechanics of additive manufactured polymers not only creates fundamental knowledge of their mechanical behaviors but also guides the design and additive manufacturing of engineering or biomedical components. Unfortunately, the mechanical responses of these polymers are strongly dependent on the manufacturing process, material composition, printing orientation, temperature, etc., which bring about great challenges for the modeling. To overcome such challenges, this chapter introduces two high-fidelity nonlinear constitutive models devised specifically for additive manufactured photopolymers to facilitate the computational design process. The first model is developed to take into account the intrinsic anisotropy of photopolymers caused by the layer-wise manufacturing feature, while the second model is targeting the thermomechanical property of photopolymers across the glass transition temperature, which can be used to simulate the shape memory effect. Note that both models are applicable to the finite deformation scenario and inelastic deformation. At the end of this chapter, we also provide our humble opinions on the research demands and trends regarding the mechanics and modeling of additive manufactured polymers.

Additive manufacturing of high-performance engineering polymers: present and future	POLYMER INTERNATIONAL			English	Review						high-performance polymers; polyimide; polysulfone; poly(ether ether ketone); additive manufacturing	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; PEEK; TECHNOLOGY	High-performance engineering polymers continually challenge existing boundaries of rapidly emerging research areas including electronics, transportation, energy, defense and aerospace. Significant research attention over the past decade highlights the exceptional performance of these polymers due to their superior thermomechanical properties and stability under extreme conditions. Unfortunately, inherent structure-property relationships of high-performance engineering polymers, which predict this unique complement of physical properties, also describe high-viscosity melts and high melting temperatures. These processing challenges have steered researchers towards advanced processing methods, such as additive manufacturing, that allow for unprecedented control over part geometry. In addition, additive manufacturing serves to advance application-cost relationships, as part optimization and 3D printing of previous monolithic components allow for less material consumption. Currently, the additive manufacturing materials toolbox only contains a fraction of commercially available high-performance polymers due to unique processing constraints. This review discusses recent efforts towards the successful additive manufacturing of three high-performance polymer families, i.e. polysulfones, poly(ether ether ketone)s and polyimides.

In the process the polymer is molten in a continuous phase and droplet breakup is realized in a rotor-stator-device. The stabilization of the newly formed surfaces is quite challenging. Therefore, a new method to identify an appropriate emulsifier by measuring the interfacial tension between the polymer and continuous phase using a high pressure / high temperature cell is presented. The obtained powders are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and by a Zimmermann tensile strength tester to determine the powder flowability. The processability of the polymer powders for additive manufacturing is investigated and demonstrated by building single layers by laser beam melting.

Because of these advantages, FDM has attracted considerable attention over the past decades in a variety of fields including electronics, biomechanical engineering, and sustainable materials. As the demand for functional materials increases, polymer composites with diverse reinforcements such as carbon nanomaterials, metals, biomaterials, and ceramics have been tailored as feedstocks for FDM. Fabrication and printing with polymeric composite filaments require understandings of the physical and chemical properties as well as thermal-rheology behavior of polymer systems, which are crucial to advancing AM development. Herein, we first provide the working mechanism of FDM, the criteria for selecting polymers, and methods for manufacturing polymer and polymer composite filaments. After that, the physical and mechanical properties and printing conditions of the pure polymer filaments, multi-material/structure filaments, and various applications using polymer composite filaments are discussed and summarized. Finally, we share some of our perspectives for the future advance of polymer-based filament for FDM.

It is one of the flexible manufacturing technique that can apply to polymers, metals, ceramics, concrete, and composites. Owing to the ability to select from a wide range of processible polymers and the enhancement in some of the properties offered by polymers, the AM industry, still predominantly targets the production of polymeric components. This review demonstrates the current state of AM industry regarding polymeric materials. A brief explanation of the additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, polymers, and polymer composites (fibre reinforces, particle reinforced and nanocomposites) utilised in the AM processes is provided. Polymer AM is being applied in different applications such as biomedical, electronics, aerospace, automobile, and sporting industries respectively. The review also emphasizes the rising importance of antimicrobial polymers in the COVID-19 pandemic. The exponential use of polymeric materials in the industrial sector has caused an increase in wastage generation and disposal issues which draws attention to the importance of green composites as well as life cycle assessment (LCA) of products and processes. Finally, the significance of Distributed Recycling via AM due to the disposal issues and low polymer recycling rates is illustrated. ? 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With any new technology comes new rules and guidelines for the optimal use of said technology. Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAAM), developed by Cincinnati Incorporated and Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Manufacturing Demonstration Facility, requires a host of new design parameters compared to small-scale 3D printing to create large-scale parts. However, BAAM also creates new possibilities in material testing and various applications in the manufacturing industry. Most of the design constraints of small-scale polymer 3D printers still apply to BAAM. Beyond those constraints, new rules and limitations exist because BAAM's large-scale system significantly changes the thermal properties associated with small-scale AM. This work details both physical and software-related design considerations for additive manufacturing. After reading this guide, one will have a better understanding of slicing software's capabilities and limitations, different physical characteristics of design and how to apply them appropriately for AM, and how to take the inherent nature of AM into consideration during the design process.

J	Yang, JK; Xiong, SF; Chen, ZW				Yuan Jingkun; Xiong Shufeng; Chen Zhangwei			Research Trends and Challenges of Additive Manufacturing of Polymer-derived Ceramics	JOURNAL OF INORGANIC MATERIALS			Chinese	Article						polymer precursor; polymer-derived ceramics; additive manufacturing; 3D printing; high-performance ceramics; review	SIOC CERAMICS; SILICON-CARBIDE; 3D; FABRICATION; MATRIX; ISSUES	As an emerging manufacturing technology, additive manufacturing technology, also known as 3D printing technology, has received extensive attention in recent years. Additive manufacturing technology has great potential in the industry of high-performance ceramics. It is expected to break the technical bottle neck of the traditional manufacturing technologies used for ceramic fabrication and greatly improve the flexibility of design and manufacturing of high-performance ceramics. This will provide a transformative impetus for the development of the manufacturing technology of the high-performance ceramic materials. Polymer-derived ceramics (PDCs) are a class of polymers obtained by chemical methods and can be transformed into ceramics by heat treatments, i.e., pyrolysis. Due to the good machinability and formability of the PDC materials themselves, the pre-forming of the designed target structures can be easily realized. These structures might not be possible with traditional ceramic manufacturing. Therefore, the combination of PDCs and additive manufacturing technology has attracted great attention from researchers. This review introduces characteristics of the additive manufacturing technology used for preceramics. Based on that, the present research status, trends and applications are also systematically described and discussed. The challenges and future directions of the additive manufacturing of polymer-derived ceramics are given for the guidance of future development.

Finite element computation and an analytical model have been used. The hypotheses of the analytical model are qualitatively justified by the results of the numerical computation. The analytical calculation is a powerful tool to rapidly evaluate the relationships between processing parameters (extrusion rate, printing head velocity, gap between the printing head and the substrate) and some characteristics of the deposition (dimensions of the deposited filament, pressure at the printing head nozzle, separating force between substrate and printing head). An isothermal hypothesis is discussed. The viscous non-Newtonian behavior is accounted for through an approximate shear thinning power law model. A printing processing window is defined following several requirements: a continuous deposit, without spreading in front of the printing head, maximum and minimum spreading pressures, an upper-limit for the separating force between head and substrate.

Mechanical anisotropy in polymer composites produced by material extrusion additive manufacturing	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Extrusion; Direct ink writing; Anisotropy; Polymer composites	FIBER ORIENTATION; CARBON-FIBER; MATRIX COMPOSITES; BEHAVIOR; FABRICATION; DEPOSITION; ALIGNMENT; FLOW; MOTION	Extrusion-based additive manufacturing technologies, such as direct ink writing of filled polymer resins, have shown a great potential for the development of printed components with superior structural and functional properties. However, the associated extrusion process induces preferred orientation on high-aspect-ratio filler materials as they extrude through the deposition nozzle, causing strong mechanical anisotropy in printed components. Printing-induced anisotropy is a critical issue that complicates the straightforward design of additively manufactured components. The goal of this work is to gain a better understanding of the anisotropy in printed polymer composites by investigating the effects of filler morphology and print parameters on the mechanical properties of printed composites. Inks are formulated using fumed silica particles or nanoclay platelets as the primary viscosifying agent, and silicon carbide (SiC) whiskers as the primary mechanical reinforcement. Mechanical anisotropy is characterized via 3pt-flexural tests for epoxy ink formulations utilizing fumed silica or nanoclay, with or without SiC whiskers, and printed at three different print speeds, using three different nozzle sizes. Orientation of nanoclay is also characterized using small- and wide-angle x-ray scattering. Results show that smaller nozzle diameters and higher deposition rates lead to greater anisotropy when nanoclay or SiC fillers are utilized, while the use of fumed silica alone results in mechanical behavior that is independent of print parameters and print path. Superior flexure strength values up to 215 MPa are obtained with SiC whisker-reinforced composites when tested parallel to the print direction.

Presently, composites containing graphene have been manufactured by many conventional processes. Since 3D printing (additive manufacturing) offers a wide range of advantages for manufacturing, researchers from the composite industry are now adopting novel techniques to manufacture graphene based composites via additive manufacturing. When selecting materials for composites, polymers stand out as the top choice for manufacturers because polymers require a low temperature to mold their shape and they are easy to handle when compared to ceramics and metals. Hence, substantial focus of the composite industry is now shifting towards manufacturing graphene based polymer matrix composites. In this regard, this paper provides a brief review of the 3D printing (additive manufacturing) processes which to date have been adopted to manufacture 'graphene based polymer matrix composites'. The promising physical properties of graphene based polymer matrix composites and the future prospects of functionalizing graphene in polymer based composites is also highlighted.

However, the mechanical properties are limited by the interfacial bonding strength between met-als and polymers achieved through adhesives, welding, and surface treatment processes. In this paper, a novel manufacturing process combining additive manufacturing and compression molding to obtain hybrid metal poly-mer composites with enhanced mechanical properties is presented. Additive manufacturing enabled deposition of polymeric material with fibers in a predetermined pattern to form tailored charge or preform for compression molding. A grade 300 maraging steel triangular lattice is first fabricated using AddUp FormUp350 laser powder bed system and compression overmolded with additively manufactured long carbon fiber-reinforced polyamide-6,6 (40% wt. CF/PA66) preform. The fabricated hybrid metal polymer composites showed high stiffness and tensile strength. The stiffness and failure characteristics determined from the uniaxial tensile tests were corre-lated to a finite element model within 20% deviation. Fractographic analyses was performed using microscopy to investigate failure mechanisms of the hybrid structures.

This technology can rapidly design and directly fabricate three-dimensional (3D) parts with multiple materials without complicating manufacturing processes. This research aims to obtain a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the current state of research and reveal challenges and opportunities for future research in the area. To achieve the goal, this study conducts a scientometric analysis and a systematic review of the global research published from 2000 to 2021 on multi-material additive manufacturing of polymers. In the scientometric analysis, a total of 2512 journal papers from the Scopus database were analyzed by evaluating the number of publications, literature coupling, keyword co-occurrence, authorship, and countries/regions activities. By doing so, the main research frame, articles, and topics of this research field were quantitatively determined. Subsequently, an in-depth systematic review is proposed to provide insight into recent advances in multi-material additive manufacturing of polymers in the aspect of technologies and applications, respectively. From the scientometric analysis, a heavy bias was found towards studying materials in this field but also a lack of focus on developing technologies. The future trend is proposed by the systematic review and is discussed in the directions of interfacial bonding strength, printing efficiency, and microscale/nanoscale multi-material 3D printing. This study contributes by providing knowledge for practitioners and researchers to understand the state of the art of multi-material additive manufacturing of polymers and expose its research needs, which can serve both academia and industry.

Almost all commercially available AM methods could benefit from various fiber reinforcement techniques. Recent developments in 3D printing methods of fiber reinforced polymers, namely, fused deposition modeling (FDM), laminated object manufacturing (LOM), stereolithography (SL), extrusion, and selective laser sintering (SLS) are reviewed in this study to understand the trends and future directions in the respective areas. In addition to extra strength, fibers have also been used in 4D printing to control and manipulate the change of shape or swelling after 3D printing, right out of the printing bed. Although AM of fiber/polymer composites are increasingly developing and under intense attention, there are some issues needed to be addressed including void formation, poor adhesion of fibers and matrix, blockage due to filler inclusion, increased curing time, modelling, simulation, etc. Nonetheless, numerous innovative techniques were spotted amongst recent work trying to overcome these challenges with new material or manufacturing techniques.

Comparing geometric tolerance capabilities of additive manufacturing systems for polymers	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Polymers; Dimensional accuracy; Tolerances; ISO IT grades	ACCURACY; BENCHMARKING; DESIGN	In all manufacturing processes, there are several factors for which the final product exhibits dimensional and shape deviations from its ideal nominal geometry. In additive manufacturing (AM) and 3D printing, a part is built layerwise in a single manufacturing step and is often net-shaped. In most cases, no finishing operation is applied to change the dimensions of the product, apart from a reduction of the superficial roughness through sandblasting or polishing. Therefore, knowing the dimensional tolerance of AM processes in advance is of fundamental importance, but little information is currently available in the literature. A benchmarking analysis of three different AM systems for polymers is presented in this paper. The compared machines are based on different AM techniques which are fused filament fabrication (FFF), selective laser sintering (SLS) and Arburg plastic freeforming (APF). The dimensional accuracy of the machines has been defined using the ISO IT grades of a reference artifact. In the analysis of the benchmarking results, a specific focus is made on the importance of the thermal household in SLS and a parameter named SLS modulus is proposed to identify critical heat concentrations in the powder bed that may influence the dimensional accuracy of the manufactured part.

Polymers and their composites are some of the most widely used materials in modern industries and are of great interest in the field of AM due to their vast potential for various applications, especially in the medical, aerospace, and automotive industries. Many studies have been conducted to develop new polymer materials for AM techniques, which include vat photopolymerization, material jetting, powder bed fusion, material extrusion, binder jetting, and sheet lamination. Although several reviews on the development of polymer materials for AM have been published, most of them only focus on a specific application, process, or type of material. Therefore, this article serves to provide a comprehensive review on the progress in polymer material development for AM techniques. It begins with an introduction to different AM techniques, followed by highlighting the progress of their development. Material requirements, notable advances in newly developed materials and their potential applications are discussed in detail and summarized. This review concludes by identifying the major challenges currently encountered in using AM for polymer materials and providing insights into the valuable opportunities it presents, in hopes of spurring further development in this field.

However, the carbon fibre composites produced using current state-of-the-art AM approaches generally possess high porosity (18-25 %) compared to those produced by conventional manufacturing (1 %). An approach known as composite fibre additive manufacturing (CFAM) is presented, involving selectively printing a binder and polymer powder onto discontinuous carbon fibre sheets, which are then compressed, heated and post -processed to form net shape components. The results demonstrate a correlation between compaction pressure applied and porosity/fibre volume fraction within components. Composite components were produced con-taining porosity of 1.5 % and fibre volume content of 15 % with 97 MPa tensile strength and 8.9 GPa elastic modulus, presenting a new approach for production of discontinuous carbon fibre reinforced polymer parts with mechanical properties exceeding those of state-of-the-art AM.

The use of 3D printing is ideal for rapid prototyping and has conventionally been utilised in concept development and for exploring different design parameters that are ultimately used to meet an intended application or routine. During the initial stage of a robot development, exploiting 3D printing can provide design freedom, customisation and sustainability and ultimately lead to direct cost benefits. Traditionally, robot specifications are selected on the basis of being able to deliver a specific task. However, a robot that can be specified by design parameters linked to a distinctive task can be developed quickly, inexpensively, and with little overall risk utilising a 3D printing process. Numerous factors are inevitably important for the design of industrial robots using polymer-based additive manufacturing. However, with an extensive range of new polymer-based additive manufacturing techniques and materials, these could provide significant benefits for future robotics design and development.

Binder jetting additive manufacturing (BJ AM) creates 3D objects upon depositing liquid adhesive onto a powder bed, while a roller spreads powder over a build stage to form subsequent layers. Many factors affect jettability and printability including printhead design, binder material, binder solvent and powder characteristics. Material design for higher strength BJ AM parts using metals, ceramics or polymers exploits binders or particles that transform into thermosets or permanently shaped matrices through thermal or UV curing and sintering. While many BJ AM examples utilize biodegradable, water-soluble and recyclable polymers for biomedical and industrial applications, a wider array of opportunities exist to degrade, dissolve and reuse printed materials. Systematically shifting to these polymers will facilitate reuse and recycling of both binders and powders, but more studies to improve part strength are required. This review describes an overview of polymer jettability and a perspective into opportunities currently underutilized in transitioning BJ AM into a more sustainable AM platform.

However, limitations in mold size remain present due to printer volume constraints and costs associated with large format machines. This paper describes a method for producing additively manufactured polymer molds in segments with an O-ring joint design, which can be machined and subsequently assembled for autoclave applications. The developed joining mechanism allows for maintaining the vacuum integrity during the cure cycle while accounting for the anisotropic nature of the additively manufactured polymer molds. Over a range of tested temperatures, 20-200 degrees C, the multi-part mold joining design was able to achieve full vacuum of-73.7 cmHg (29 inchHg) and maintain a vacuum integrity with vacuum losses less than 1.5 cmHg/5min (0.6 inchHg).(c) 2022 Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME).

Ceramic structural components, especially those with highly complex structures and shapes, are difficult to fabricate with conventional methods, such as sintering and hot isostatic pressing (HIP). The use of preceramic polymers has many advantages, such as excellent processibility, easy shape change, and tailorable composition for fabricating high-performance ceramic components. Additive manufacturing (AM) is an evolving manufacturing technique that can be used to construct complex and intricate structural components. Integrating polymer-derived ceramics and AM techniques has drawn significant attention, as it overcomes the limitations and challenges of conventional fabrication approaches.

Polymer additive manufacturing of ABS structure: Influence of printing direction on mechanical properties	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES			English	Article						Polymer additive manufacturing (PAM); Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS); Mechanical characterization; Printing orientation	PROCESS PARAMETERS; OPTIMIZATION; COMPONENTS; PLA	The present study relates to Polymers Additive Manufacturing (PAM) traditionally used for rapid prototyping operations. The use of PAM components as functional parts is still marginal compared to injection molded components. This is due to the uncertainty on their mechanical properties and to the present knowledge on PAM products. A new additive manufacturing technology has been integrated in the free former-Arburg machine. It was inspired by injection molding technology and creates plastic parts using layers built up from tiny droplets of polymer. In this work, the mechanical characterization of thermoplastic polymer parts obtained by Arburg Plastic Free forming (APF) is studied. Additionally the mechanical properties of polymer specimens obtained by injection molding as a conventional process are studied in order to evaluate the influence of the manufacturing process on the parts mechanical behavior. The tensile mechanical properties are evaluated by varying some manufacturing parameters, such as the printing path. Microstructural analyses have been performed to better understand the relationship between the manufacturing process and the final mechanical properties.	[Dana, H.

Despite its potential, challenges persist in terms of limited material selection, anisotropic properties, and achieving functional microstructures in polymer and metal composites. Field-assisted additive manufacturing (FAAM) employs external fields like acoustic, magnetic, and electric fields. It has shown promise in addressing these limitations by controlling filler orientation and concentration in polymeric composites and improving surface finish and microstructure in metals. This review paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art FAAM processes for polymer and metal composites, focusing on material compatibility, the mechanics of each field, and their integration with AM technologies as well as current applications, limitations, and potential future directions in the development of FAAM processes. Enhancing FAAM process understanding can create tailored anisotropic composites, enabling innovative applications in aerospace, automotive, biomedical fields, and beyond.

J	Jockusch, J; Ozcan, M				Jockusch, Julia; Ozcan, Mutlu			Additive manufacturing of dental polymers: An overview on processes, materials and applications	DENTAL MATERIALS JOURNAL			English	Review						Additive manufacturing; Polymer; 3D printing	TECHNOLOGY; FABRICATION; SCAFFOLDS; PEEK; PROSTHESES; DENTISTRY; PATTERNS; OPTIONS; DESIGN; CASTS	Additive manufacturing (AM) processes are increasingly used in dentistry. The underlying process is the joining of material layer by layer based on 3D data models. Four additive processes (laser stereolithography, polymer jetting, digital light processing, fused deposition modeling) are mainly used for processing dental polymers. The number of polymer materials that can be used for AM in dentistry is small compared to other areas. Applications in dentistry using AM are limited (e.g. study models, maxillo-facial prostheses, orthodontic appliances etc.). New and further developments of materials are currently taking place due to the increasing demand for safer and other applications. Biocompatibility and the possibility of using materials not only as temporarily but as definitive reconstructions under oral conditions, mechanically more stable materials where less or no post-processing is needed are current targets in AM technologies. Printing parameters are also open for further development where optical aspects are also important.

This review paper attempts to provide a comprehensive review of both commercially available materials as well as research activities related to recent progress on high-performance polymer nanocomposites that are being used in various AM techniques. Four AM techniques including Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF), Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), Multi Jet Fusion (MJF), and Stereolithography (SLA) are discussed. The development of printable polymer composites especially polymer nanocomposites is rapidly expanding the AM materials portfolio, which makes the production of multifunctional parts with complex structures possible.

In the context of polymer extrusion based additive manufacturing, post-process approaches, such as thermal annealing have been reported for improving mechanical properties based on reptation of polymer chains and enhanced filament-to-filament adhesion. However, there is a lack of similar work for improving thermal properties such as thermal conductivity. This paper reports significant enhancement in build-direction thermal conductivity of polymer extrusion based parts as a result of thermal annealing. Over 150% improvement is observed when annealed at 135 degrees C for 96 h. The effect of annealing temperature and time on thermal conductivity enhancement is investigated through experiments. A theoretical model based on Arrhenius kinetics for neck growth and a heat transfer model for the consequent impact on inter-layer thermal contact resistance is developed. Predicted thermal conductivity enhancement is found to be in good agreement with experimental data for a wide range of annealing temperature and time. The theoretical model may play a key role in developing practical thermal annealing strategies that account for the multiple constraints involved in annealing of polymer parts. This work may facilitate the use of polymer extrusion additive manufacturing for producing enhanced thermal conductivity parts capable of withstanding thermal loads.

Besides metals and ceramics, polymers have become a widely researched class of materials for applications in AM. The synthetic versatility and adaptability, as well as the wide range of properties that can be achieved using polymer materials, have rendered polymers the most widely employed class of materials for AM methodologies, In this review, the basic principles, considering the printing mechanism as well as the advantages and disadvantages, of the most relevant polymer AM technologies are described. The particular features, properties and limitations of currently employed polymer systems in the various AM technology areas are presented and analyzed. Subsequently, 4D printing, that is the fabrication of 3D printed structures that are cabable to change with time, is discussed. A brief description of the polymeric materials and technologies under development for 4D printed structures as well as the different shape changes explored are presented. Finally, based on the characteristics of the polymers employed for each technology illustrative examples of the principal applications are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Reliability-Based Evaluation of the Suitability of Polymers for Additive Manufacturing Intended for Extreme Operating Conditions	POLYMERS			English	Article						polymer selection; design-for-reliability; durability; additive manufacturing; extreme operation	LASER SINTERING PROCESS; SELECTION	A reliability engineering program must be implemented from the conceptual phase of the physical asset to define the performance requirements of the components and equipment. Thus, in this work, the aim is to find the most optimal solution to manufacture polymer-based parts for the nuclear power industry using additive manufacturing routes. This case study application has been selected because polymers processed by additive manufacturing (AM) can be well suited for nuclear applications. The methodology includes-firstly-an analysis of the suitability of materials based on high-temperature resistance, thermal aging and irradiation tolerance, considering operation conditions. Secondly, an analysis of materials' processability considering their associated AM routes is performed based on thermal analysis and evaluation of physical properties of materials. A final assessment integrating the in-service suitability and AM processability is performed using a reliability approach, solving different emerging objective conflicts through defined constraints and selection criteria. According to the integrated in-service performance evaluation: Polypropylene-ethylene polyallomer (PPP), Epoxy (EP), Phenolics (Ph), Polyurethane (PU) and Acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) are the best options for mild operation conditions and EP, Ph and PU, considering high temperature along with radiation exposure. Considering AM techniques: EP and Ph can be manufactured using VAT photopolymerization-stereolithography (VP-SLA) with a good expected processability being these materials valid for high temperature environments. Consequently, this research work analyzes the viability, processability and in-service behavior of parts.

Development of a Glycerol Based Polymer for Additive Manufacturing	WASTE AND BIOMASS VALORIZATION			English	Article						Biodiesel; Glycerol; Thermoplastic polymer; Additive manufacturing; Material extrusion technology	POLYESTERS; BIODIESEL; TRENDS	This paper presents a proposal to synthetize a thermoplastic polymer from glycerol designed to be used as feedstock for additive manufacturing (AM) based on the material extrusion (ME) principle. A first round of synthesis was carried out considering different variables to search a thermoplastic solid without stickiness. After the evaluation of some AM-ME basic requirements, two other synthesis groups (the second and third rounds) were prepared to verify a proper catalyst amount and reaction time. These trial samples were characterized by infrared spectrometry and thermogravimetric analysis. The material obtained which was considered the most suitable showed an amorphous structure and a glass transition slightly below room temperature. In the end, this polymer was used as feedstock to print basic geometric specimens and evaluate both filament and layer adhesion. The result suggests the feasibility to synthetize a thermoplastic polymer from glycerol for AM-ME technology. The polymer obtained from the renewable resource has the potential to become an option for this technology. However, further studies considering additives are required to improve the polymer properties, starting by increasing its glass transition temperature. In summary, the polymer obtained from the renewable resource has the potential to become an option for AM-ME technology.	[Olanyk, L.

Mechanical strength of welding zones produced by polymer extrusion additive manufacturing	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Polymer extrusion; Fused deposition modeling; ABS; Bond strength; Mechanical strength; Additive manufacturing; 3D printing; FDM; FFF	DEPOSITION; ABS	As more manufacturing processes and research institutions adopt customized manufacturing as a key element in their design strategies and finished products, the resulting mechanical properties of parts produced through additive manufacturing (AM) must be characterized and understood. In polymer extrusion (PE), the most recently extruded polymer filament must bond to the previously extruded filament via polymer diffusion to form a "weld". The strength of the weld limits the performance of the manufactured part and is controlled through processing conditions. Understanding the role of processing conditions, specifically extruder velocity and extruder temperature, on the overall strength of the weld will allow optimization of PE-AM parts. Here, the fracture toughness of a single weld is determined through a facile "trouser tear" Mode III fracture experiment. The actual weld thickness is observed directly by optical microscopy (OM) characterization of cross sections of PE-AM samples. Representative data of weld strength as a function of printing parameters on a commercial 3D printer demonstrates the robustness of the method. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Local Viscosity Control Printing for High-Throughput Additive Manufacturing of Polymers	3D PRINTING AND ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						additive manufacturing; rapid prototyping; fused deposition modeling; high-throughput manufacturing processes		Fused deposition modeling's (FDM) throughput is limited by process physics as well as practical considerations favoring single-head polymer extrusion. To expedite the thermoplastic additive manufacturing process, we propose a parallelized material deposition process called local viscosity control (LVC) additive manufacturing. LVC prints an entire layer in one step by selectively modulating the viscosity of polymer feedstock in contact with a heated wire mesh. Layers of molten polymer are contact printed, with the relative motion between the wire mechanism and a build plate allowing wetting and surface tension to transfer selectively heated, lower viscosity regions of polymer to a fixed substrate. Experiments demonstrate the viability of this process using a single cell depositing layered polycarbonate pixels. Theoretical analysis shows this process may offer similar capabilities in resolution to conventional FDM with a significantly higher production rate for commonly available input power.

Further, this work bridges the gap between the additive process conditions (time-temperature history) and the effective layer-to-layer fracture properties developed within a printed component. This is the first step to predict delamination that can occur during printing, during cooling to room temperature after printing, and during service performance of an additively manufactured geometry. A phenomenological model is developed for fusion bonding of semicrystalline polymer matrix composites by coupling the interdiffusion of polymer chains with the evolution of polymer crystallinity. While the interdiffusion is captured by reptation theory of polymer dynamics, the evolution of crystallinity is modeled by phenomenological crystallization kinetics and crystal melting dynamics. Further, a methodology is developed to determine the critical strain energy release rate, GICof the interlayer interface and experiments are conducted utilizing the double cantilever beam fracture test geometry. Predictions of GIC as a function of thermal history are compared with experiments.	[Barocio, Eduardo; Favaloro, Anthony; Pipes, R.

Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing technologies are promising for the fabrication of ceramic components. However, printing of ceramics directly from their raw powders is a daunting task and requires multistep processing. Preceramic polymers (PCPs) offer an attractive pathway towards AM of preceramic structures featuring heterogeneous architectures and their direct conversion to polymer-derived ceramics (PDCs) - the corresponding ceramics. This review reports a detailed summary of recent research progress on the additive manufacturing of PCPs and the corresponding PDCs manufactured for different applications. The approaches towards the synthesis of various PCPs are discussed along with easily tunable chemical formulations that can be employed in AM processes. Further, the review discusses conventional PDC technology as well as AM technologies that can be employed with PCPs and the associated superiorities and drawbacks in comparison to powder-based ceramic 3D printing. Complex-shaped PDC structures and their properties and potential applications are also discussed. Overall, this review illustrates the AM capabilities of PCPs for cost-effective fabrication of advanced ceramics with high resolution, superior performance, lower environmental impact and new functionalities.

However, existing studies mostly focus on the manufacturing process without paying sufficient attention to exploring new design opportunities enabled by CFRP-AM. This paper outlines the design concept for additive manufacturing of continuous fiber reinforced polymer composites, aiming to improve existing products' performance and foster product innovations for future needs. More specifically, existing CFRPAM techniques are reviewed from the perspective of functional requirements. Design opportunities within the material, process, and structure domains are identified. Also, novel applications enabled by design for CFRP-AM on shape morphing, sensing, and energy storage are presented. The review concludes with a brief discussion and an outlook on future work.

However, the linkages among ME polymers' mesostructure, effective properties, and printing conditions are still not clear enough. In this context, the present work aims to establish a model capable of estimating the structure and elastic properties of unidirectionally extruded thermoplastic polymers just by setting printing conditions and intrinsic material properties as primary variables. To this end, according to the principle of mass conservation and a thermal-sintering model, the geometry of ME polymers, characterized by strands' shape, size, and the bonding condition, are predicted firstly. Next, based on the representative volume element (RVE), numerical homogenization is conducted via the finite element method to gain the products' orthotropic properties. Tests on ME Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) products are also made. Our experimental results, together with the existing experimental data, verified the present model. Furthermore, parametric analyses are carried out. Effects of layer thickness, printing speed, flaw rate and extrusion temperature et al. on ME polymers' porosity and mechanical behaviors are revealed, which may have important implications in the future ME additive manufacturing of thermoplastic polymers.

Thereby, the work mainly focuses on the realization of mechanical components, but the additive manufacturing technology offers a high potential in the field of optics as well. Owing to new design possibilities, completely new solutions are possible. This article briefly reviews and compares the most important additive manufacturing methods for polymer optics. Additionally, it points out the characteristics of additive manufactured polymer optics. Thereby, surface quality is of crucial importance. In order to improve it, appropriate post-processing steps are necessary (e.g. robot polishing or coating), which will be discussed. An essential part of this paper deals with various additive manufactured optical components and their use, especially in optical systems for shape metrology (e.g. borehole sensor, tilt sensor, freeform surface sensor, fisheye lens). The examples should demonstrate the potentials and limitations of optical components produced by additive manufacturing.

The SLS process employs micron-sized polymer particles, which are selectively fused by a laser. While there seem to be hardly any boundaries regarding design, there are quite some restrictions concerning the variety of commercially available SLS materials. With a market share of roughly 90%, polyamide 12 (PA12) is currently the most widely used polymer material for SLS. In order to increase the understanding of the precipitation based manufacturing process for polyamide powders, production of polyamide 11 powders via precipitation in ethanol was investigated. The polymer particles need to be optimized regarding size, shape, flowability and packing characteristics. In this contribution particle manufacturing via liquid-liquid phase separation is discussed. Bulk polymer material of polyamide 11 is directly converted to spherical micron sized particles in a single unit operation. The produced particles are characterized regarding their size and morphology. Furthermore, also structural characteristics, crystallinity and flowability are analyzed and the product properties are correlated with process parameters. We discuss the potential of this process for the production of novel, easy-to-handle polymer particle systems for SLS.

In particular, the investigation was focused on a water pump impeller as a practical case study. A comparison between mechanical properties was proposed for this scope. ABSplus, ABS and PLA polymers were considered. Materials were tested in tensile and bending conditions. Results showed that ABSplus and ABS polymers satisfy all the mechanical requirements, while PLA fails. Then, the impellers were built-in and tested. All functional requirements, together with the necessary stability were verified. In this way, it was proved that, by selecting a suitable polymer, additive manufacturing can be successfully used to produce complex final elements, thus leading to extremely fast production, high accuracy and precision and even lower costs compared to other conventional technologies.

Additive manufacturing with polypropylene microfibers	MATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING C-MATERIALS FOR BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; 3D printing; Polymer processing	PHENOMENOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS; HERNIA REPAIR; MELT; POLYMER; SCAFFOLDS; FIBERS; MESH	The additive manufacturing of small diameter polypropylene microfibers is described, achieved using a technique termed melt electrospinning writing. Sequential fiber layering, which is important for accurate three-dimensional fabrication, was achieved with the smallest fiber diameter of 16.4 +/- 0.2 mu m obtained. The collector speed, temperature and melt flow rate to the nozzle were optimized for quality and minimal fiber pulsing. Of particular importance to the success of this method is appropriate heating of the collector plate, so that the electrostatically drawn filament adheres during the direct-writing process. By demonstrating the direct-writing of polypropylene, new applications exploiting the favorable mechanical, stability and biocompatible properties of this polymer are envisaged.

Initial research has been performed targeting the integration of fibers into additive manufactured plastic composites. Major advantages, among others, are for example increased tensile strength and Young's modulus. Key challenges in the field, as of now, are proper fiber placement, fiber seizing, an increased knowledge in the used materials and how they are applied into engineering solutions through proper control of the additive manufacturing process. The aim of this research is the improved understanding of fiber-reinforcement in additive manufacturing in terms of production and application. Vat polymerization and material extrusion techniques for composite additive manufacturing were investigated with respect of increasing adhesion between the matrix material and the fibers. Process optimization was performed in order to avoid matrix cracks and delamination. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Several studies have been conducted to increase the ceramic content in the feedstock, but the binder and additives in it have remained in the polymeric content. A novel strategy for highly dense additive manufacturing using a sol-gel-based ceramic slurry without polymeric additives is presented. Alumina, which is the most widely used fine ceramic, was chosen as a representative ceramic material. The proposed sol-gel solution enabled a high solid loading of approx-imately 50 vol% without any polymeric dispersant while satisfying the requirements for material extru-sion process, such as extrudable viscosity (<100 Pa.s) and self-sustainable yield stress. This novel sol-gel binder system evolves into aluminum oxide nanoparticles during the sintering process, eventually fusing to the alumina particles. The as-printed green body possessed high alumina content and 66% of theoret-ical density, which was higher than that obtained via the conventional molding methods. A reduced lin-ear shrinkage of less than 16% and a high density of 99.5% of the theoretical value were also achieved. This research would present a practical strategy for ceramic additive manufacturing as an emerging fabrica-tion process. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This methodology materializes the hybrid material implants manufacturing through the integration of two or more advanced Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies. Furthermore, high strength biomechanical implants with optimized geometry and mass can be manufactured by biomimetic concepts application. The combination of polymers and ceramics or polymers and metal materials (or metal alloys) allows a significant leap in the development and production of a great diversity of components and applications. The combination of advanced additive manufacturing processes, e.g. the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) or Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) and the StereoLithography (SL), make possible the production of parts with almost unlimited geometric freedom and custom multimaterial. The manufacturing flexibility and the processing capacity of the different combinations of materials - metal/polymer - obtained from hybrid additive manufacturing systems - SLM/SL - are demonstrated here by the manufacture of a dental bridge implant.

J	Garces, IT; Ayranci, C				Garces, Irina Tatiana; Ayranci, Cagri			Advances in additive manufacturing of shape memory polymer composites	RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL			English	Review						4D printing; 3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Shape memory effect; Shape memory polymer composites	DIRECT-WRITE FABRICATION; RECOVERY FORCE; BEHAVIOR; POLYURETHANE; PROPERTY; NANOCOMPOSITES; ELASTOMER; ACTUATION; PROGRESS	Purpose - A review on additive manufacturing (AM) of shape memory polymer composites (SMPCs) is put forward to highlight the progress made up to date, conduct a critical review and show the limitations and possible improvements in the different research areas within the different AM techniques. The purpose of this study is to identify academic and industrial opportunities. Design/methodology/approach - This paper introduces the reader to three-dimensional (3 D) and four-dimensional printing of shape memory polymers (SMPs). Specifically, this review centres on manufacturing technologies based on material extrusion, photopolymerization, powder-based and lamination manufacturing processes. AM of SMPC was classified according to the nature of the filler material: particle dispersed, i.e. carbon, metallic and ceramic and long fibre reinforced materials, i.e. carbon fibres. This paper makes a distinction for multi-material printing with SMPs, as multi-functionality and exciting applications can be proposed through this method. Manufacturing strategies and technologies for SMPC are addressed in this review and opportunities in the research are highlighted. Findings - This paper denotes the existing limitations in the current AM technologies and proposes several directions that will contribute to better use and improvements in the production of additive manufactured SMPC. With advances in AM technologies, gradient changes in material properties can open diverse applications of SMPC. Because of multi-material printing, co-manufacturing sensors to 3D printed smart structures can bring this technology a step closer to obtain full control of the shape memory effect and its characteristics. This paper discusses the novel developments in device and functional part design using SMPC, which should be aided with simple first stage design models followed by complex simulations for iterative and optimized design. A change in paradigm for designing complex structures is still to be made from engineers to exploit the full potential of additive manufactured SMPC structures. Originality/value - Advances in AM have opened the gateway to the potential design and fabrication of functional parts with SMPs and their composites. There have been many publications and reviews conducted in this area; yet, many mainly focus on SMPs and reserve a small section to SMPC. This paper presents a comprehensive review directed solely on the AM of SMPC while highlighting the research opportunities.

Overcoming limitations of polymer additive manufacturing for snap-fit joint design and part assembly	PROGRESS IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article; Early Access						Design methodology; Additive manufacturing; Snap-fit joints; Assembly design; Part coupling		Polymer additive manufacturing has been widely used across a variety of industries due to its design flexibility advantage and rapid prototyping capabilities. However, there are still limitations that prevent the full potential of this technology from being exploited. One of these limitations has to do with the necessity of assembly and disassembly of manufactured parts to ease the installation of inner components. Notably, snap-fit joints have proven to be a very useful coupling mechanism when trying to assemble two or more parts. However, they can be challenging to design, particularly when using additive manufacturing processes. Consequently, this paper discusses the use of polymer additive manufacturing, specifically in the context of snap-fit joint design and part assembly. An extended design methodology is proposed, ranging from global considerations on material properties and technology used for in-detail considerations concerning part geometry and coupling mechanisms. The methodology is based on a systematic approach of design for additive manufacturing and evaluation of the snap-fit joints. Additionally, a process for estimating the quantity of required joint elements is included in the methodology, which is a novel contribution to the literature in this field. Ultimately, the proposed design process is demonstrated in a case study including snap-fit joints for part assembly. The results suggest that, by applying the proposed methodology, designers can overcome the limitations of polymer additive manufacturing and achieve successful designs of complex parts with snap-fit joints as coupling elements.

Additive manufacturing represents a promising field for future research in bone replacement/regeneration. However, standard guidelines for mimicking clinical environment with the different bone characteristics are strongly required. The rapid prototyping techniques, particularly, bioprinting allows the construct of 3D living functional tissues able to replace, in the near future, large defects caused by tumor excision, trauma, clefts or infections, limiting the autogenous bone graft requirement.

Most of the current devices are rigid two-dimensional systems and possess uncontrollable geometries and architectures that lead to poor mechanical properties presenting ion/electronic diffusion limitations. The goal of the article is to provide an overview about the additive manufacturing (AM) of conducting polymers, which is of paramount importance for the design of future wearable three-dimensional (3D) (bio)electronic devices. Among different 3D printing AM techniques, inkjet, extrusion, electrohydrodynamic, and light-based printing have been mainly used. This review article collects examples of 3D printing of conducting polymers such as poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene), polypyrrole, and polyaniline. It also shows examples of AM of these polymers combined with other polymers and/or conducting fillers such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and silver nanowires. Afterward, the foremost applications of CPs processed by 3D printing techniques in the biomedical and energy fields, that is, wearable electronics, sensors, soft robotics for human motion, or health monitoring devices, among others, will be discussed.

Conventional methods to fabricate conjugated polymer transducers produce devices with planar morphologies that limit fabricated devices to simplistic linear or bending modes of operation. To overcome this limitation, this work develops a photosensitive polypyrrole formulation and light-based additive manufacturing method capable of realizing three-dimensional conjugated polymer structures with micro-scale features. The electroactivity and strain sensing properties of the photosensitive polymer formulation are reported to show the early development of this method towards new sensing and actuation technologies.

Additive Manufacturing: Future Challenges	POLYMER-BASED ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING: BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Book Chapter						Additive manufacturing; Patient specific; Future challenges	ON-A-CHIP; FABRICATION	Since additive manufacturing processes, as we know them today, were invented in the mid-1980s, there has being an upsurge in its use as a bona fide manufacturing technique. Additive manufacturing has entered the space of biomedical applications where teeth retainers and hearing aids are commonly produced by this technique with the latter almost exclusively made so. This appears to be only the tip of the iceberg but there are a number of challenges, in terms of the process and materials, which must be overcome before the additive technique becomes dominant in mainstream manufacturing. As these are overcome, other challenges will arise such as standardisation, inspection, business models and, of course, unexpected consequences. Nevertheless, the advantages of additive manufacturing will ensure that it has a key role to play in biomedical applications.

The material properties of the 3D printed carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP) were firstly systematically investigated by extensive tensile tests aided by the digital image correlation (DIC) system, through which the microscale material anisotropy was clarified. Moreover, the accurate orthotropic material models were introduced into the as-fabricated mesoscale unit lattices with geometric errors to obtain the effective mechanical properties. Finally, mechanical performance of the macroscale structures was optimized by the integration of the ideal and as-fabricated unit lattices with the homogenization-based topology optimization method. The AM process-induced material anisotropy and geometric errors result in significant deviations of the mechanical property of the topologically optimized macrostructures and more accurate topology optimization results can be achieved considering the microscale material anisotropy and the geometric error in the mesoscale unit lattice. The results obtained in this investigation indicate that it is essential to comprehensively consider the AM processinduced microscale material anisotropy and mesoscale geometric errors in the topology optimization of fibre reinforced polymer lattice structures to improve the accuracy and reliability of the optimal design.

Therefore, polymer moulds are used to inject standard specimens to compare material properties to specimens produced using a conventional aluminium tool. Design/methodology/approach PolyJet technology is used to three-dimensional (3D)-print a mould insert in Digital ABS and selective laser sintering (SLS) technology is used to 3D-print a mould insert in polyamide (PA) 3200 GF. A conventionally aluminium milled tool serves as reference. Standard specimens are produced to compare resulting mechanical properties, shrinkage behaviour and morphology. Findings The determined material characteristics of the manufactured prototypes from the additive manufactured tools show differences in terms of mechanical behaviour to those from the aluminium reference tool. The most significant differences are an up to 25 per cent lower tensile elongation and an up to 63 per cent lower elongation at break resulting in an embrittlement of the specimens produced. These differences seem to be mainly due to the different morphological structure caused by the lower thermal conductivity and greater surface roughness of the polymer tools. Research limitations/implications The determined differences in mechanical behaviour can partly be assigned to differences in surface roughness and morphological structure of the resulting parts. The exact extend of either cause, however, cannot be clearly determined. Originality/value This study provides a comparison between the part material properties from conventionally milled aluminium tools and polymer inserts manufactured via additive tooling.

While the principal cynosure so far is the formulation of ameliorated therapeutics contingent on "omics" data, the notion outstretches all embodiments of customized treatment. Howbeit, the dearth of in vitro tissue and organ models competent of mimicking human physiology gravely impede the development and clinical translation of drugs and therapies with higher in vivo efficiency. Bioprinting (a form of additive manufacturing) enables us to effectively address the perpetual limitations for the manufacturing of hierarchically organized living constructs with complex structural and functional organization through the precise spatial positioning of multiple materials and cells. Additive manufacturing translates computer-aided design virtual 3D models into physical objects. By digital splicing of tomographic data, 3D scan, or computer-aided design, layer-by-layer fabrication of target objects can be achieved bereft the requirement for molds or machining. As polymeric materials are by far the most exploited class of materials, the anecdote discusses the processing of polymers and the development of polymers and advanced polymeric systems, especially for bioprinting. Facets of polymer design, additives, and processing parameters as they harmonize to exalting build speed and improved veracity, stability, functionality, mechanical attributes, porosity, and surface finish are explored. As the field matures, additive manufacturing is poised to proffer patient-specific tissue and organ substitutes, reproducible microtissues for drug screening and disease modeling, personalized drug delivery systems, as well as customized medical devices; therefore, we also highlight the most pressing challenges facing the research domain to revolutionize modern medicine and healthcare.

J	Dogan, O				Dogan, Oguz			Short-term Creep Behaviour of Different Polymers Used in Additive Manufacturing under Different Thermal and Loading Conditions	STROJNISKI VESTNIK-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; creep experiments; polymer materials; thermal effect	TENSILE	Polymer materials produced by additive manufacturing undergo significant changes in their dimensions under continuous loading conditions. This situation affects the operation of polymer structures produced by additive manufacturing within safe limits. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the creep behaviour of polymers produced by the additive manufacturing method. This study investigates the creep behaviour of six different materials, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), chlorinated polyethylene (CPE), polylactic acid (PLA), tough polylactic acid (TPLA), polycarbonates (PC), and nylon most commonly used in additive manufacturing. The creep test specimens are firstly produced with a three-dimensional (3D) printer, and then their final dimensions are given using computer numerical control (CNC) milling. The creep experiments are carried out at three different ambient temperatures (25 degrees C, 40 degrees C, and 60 degrees C) and two different stress levels (10 MPa, 20 MPa). According to the test results, it was determined that the material type, temperature, and loading levels significantly influenced the creep behaviour of the 3D printed polymer materials.

Additive manufacturing of polymer-based structures by extrusion technologies	OXFORD OPEN MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Review						additive manufacturing; polymer; composite materials; fused filament fabrication; direct ink writing		Extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) enables the fabrication of three-dimensional structures with intricate cellular architectures where the material is selectively dispensed through a nozzle or orifice in a layer-by-layer fashion at the macro-, meso-, and micro-scale. Polymers and their composites are one of the most widely used materials and are of great interest in the field of AM due to their vast potential for various applications, especially for the medical, military, aerospace, and automotive industries. Because architected polymer-based structures impart remarkably improved material properties such as low density and high mechanical performance compared to their bulk counterparts, this review focuses particularly on the development of such objects by extrusion-based AM intended for structural applications. This review introduces the extrusion-based AM techniques followed by a discussion on the wide variety of materials used for extrusion printing, various architected structures, and their mechanical properties. Notable advances in newly developed polymer and composite materials and their potential applications are summarized. Finally, perspectives and insights into future research of extrusion-based AM on developing high-performance ultra-light materials using polymers and their composite materials are discussed.

Some applications are related to the production of personalized devices, implants (orthopedic and dental), drug dosage forms (antibacterial, immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, etc.), or 3D implants that contain active pharmaceutical treatments, which favor cellular proliferation and tissue regeneration. This review is focused on the generation of 3D printed polymer-based objects that present antibacterial properties. Two main different alternatives of obtaining these 3D printed objects are fully described, which employ different polymer sources. The first one uses natural polymers that, in some cases, already exhibit intrinsic antibacterial capacities. The second alternative involves the use of synthetic polymers, and thus takes advantage of polymers with antimicrobial functional groups, as well as alternative strategies based on the modification of the surface of polymers or the elaboration of composite materials through adding certain antibacterial agents or incorporating different drugs into the polymeric matrix.

Short layer build times do not provide enough time for the material to cool sufficiently. As a result, an object cannot support its own weight nor deal with overhanging features. Additionally, the generation of support structures may be impractical either due to geometry or, in the case of large-scale polymer additive manufacturing, due to being difficult to remove. To address these issues, researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Manufacturing Demonstration Facility investigated the use of a thermal camera mounted to a gantry to collect data on an object under construction. This data provided feedback for an in-situ control system to adjust layer build times. Adjustments were made in the form of additional waiting to allow the material to cool to specific thermal thresholds. This additional cooling time allowed the construction of objects with low layer build times or overhanging features that would have otherwise failed. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, the measurement of complex micro products and the evaluation of the related uncertainty are still particularly challenging and necessary in the micro AM field. In the DTU, a proprietary Vat Photopolymerization machine able to produce micro features has been designed, built and validated. This study evaluates the capability of the machine in terms of printed dimensions and the corresponding uncertainty assessment. For this purpose, two test parts with micro features of different geometries and dimensions have been designed and five samples of each test part have been printed. The dimensions of the micro features have been evaluated for quality control capability assessment and to stablish procedures for verification of AM machines. (C) 2018 The Authors.

However, our understanding of their properties, and thus our ability to predict them and to design parts based on them, remains limited. With this in mind, nanolaminates have been formed via an additive process developed in our group and referred to as automated spray deposition; these materials have been characterized with the express purpose of better understanding the composition-structure-properties relations critical to our ability to create high performance polymeric materials by design via additive techniques. Here we present a preliminary comparison of the dynamic mechanical properties of two families of nanolaminates, essentially identical except for the polarity of the polymer phase and the strength of polymer / nanofiller interactions, with the aim of better understanding the mechanical response of such materials.

J	Huang, HH; Liu, WH; Liu, ZF				Huang, Haihong; Liu, Weihao; Liu, Zhifeng			An additive manufacturing-based approach for carbon fiber reinforced polymer recycling	CIRP ANNALS-MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Recycling; Composite; Additive manufacturing		The vast Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) waste accumulated is pressing for its recycling. A novel recycling approach, which integrated carbon fiber reclamation and composite additive manufacturing, is proposed to process the CFRP waste into three Dimensional (3D) parts. In the experiments, the CFRP waste was recycled by supercritical n-butanol to yield reclaimed Carbon Fibers (rCFs). The rCFs were ground by a ball mill, mixed with Poly-Ether-Ether-Ketone (PEEK) powder and then extruded to the composite filament. The filament was fed to the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printer to fabricate 3D parts. Mechanical and electrical properties of the parts were investigated and compared with that of pure PEEK. The results illustrate that the additive manufacturing-based approach offers a potential strategy to reuse the CFRP waste and rapidly fabricate the rCF reinforced plastics with complex geometry and function.

The conventional composite manufacturing processes such as wet lay-up, resin transfer molding, automatic lay ups etc. suffer from a lot of practical and material issues which have limited their use. The mechanical properties of the parts produced by such processes also suffer from variation that causes problems downstream. Composites based additive manufacturing processes such as Fused Deposition Modeling and Composite Filament Fabrication are trying to remove some of the barriers to the use of composites. Additive manufacturing processes offer more design and material freedom than conventional composite manufacturing processes. This paper compares conventional composite processes for the manufacturing of Epoxy-Fiberglass fiber reinforced polymers with composite filament fabrication based Nylon-Fiberglass fiber reinforced polymers. Mechanical properties such as tensile strength, elastic modulus, and fatigue life are compared for the different processes. The effect of process parameters on these mechanical properties for the composite filament fabrication based process is also examined in this work. It is found that the composite filament fabrication based process is very versatile and the parts manufactured by this process can be used in various applications.

The majority of companies that design and test 3D printing machines work with thermoplastic acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA) filaments. It is, however, crucial to utilize different types of filaments for a broader range of applications with different mechanical property requirements. Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are smart materials that react to an applied stimulus in order to recover large strains. MEAM techniques may be used for the production of SMP-based parts, allowing for smart structures to be created in a wide variety of geometries. In this work, a commercial 3D-printer was used to produce 3D printed polyurethane-based SMP specimens. An annealing heat treatment was applied to some of the specimens. Mechanical and thermomechanical testing was conducted to study the effects of testing temperatures and annealing heat treatments on the tensile and shape memory properties of the samples. 3D printing was shown to be a suitable technique for producing SMP parts capable of retaining good shape memory characteristics. Different annealing heat treatments and test temperatures were found to have considerable effects on the SMP specimen properties. In particular, annealing the specimens at 85 degrees C for 2 h helped to improve the rate of shape recovery and the consistency of mechanical test results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cruz; Boudaoud, Hakim; Hoppe, Sandrine; Camargo, Mauricio			Polymer recycling in an open-source additive manufacturing context: Mechanical issues	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						3D printing; Plastic recycling; Mechanical properties; PLA; Open source additive manufacturing; RepRap		Nowadays, the low recycling rate of polymers is still a challenge to humankind due to energy, economic and logistical issues. In the context of additive manufacturing, there is an exponential use of thermoplastic materials in the industrial and public open-source additive manufacturing sector, leading to an increase in global polymer consumption and waste generation. However, the coupling of the open-source 3D printers with polymer processing could potentially offer the basis for a new paradigm of distributed recycling process. It could be a complementary alternative to the traditional paradigm of centralized recycling of polymers, which is often uneconomical and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. In order to achieve this goal, a first step is to prove the technical feasibility to recycle thermoplastic material intended for open-source 3D printing feedstock. The contribution of the present study is twofold: first, a general methodology to evaluate the recyclability of thermoplastics used as feedstock in open-source 3D printing machines is proposed. Then, the proposed methodology is applied to the recycling study of polylactic acid (PLA) material addressed to the fused filament fabrication (FFF) technique, which is currently the most widely used. The main results of this application contribute to the understanding of the influence of the material's physico-chemical degradation on its mechanical properties as well as its potential distributed recyclability.

J	Akasheh, F; Aglan, H				Akasheh, Firas; Aglan, Heshmat			Fracture toughness enhancement of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites utilizing additive manufacturing fabrication	JOURNAL OF ELASTOMERS AND PLASTICS			English	Article						3-D printed composites; fracture resistance; unidirectional reinforcement; additive manufacturing; surface morphology		The present work reports a novel approach to enhance the fracture resistance and notch sensitivity of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites utilizing additive manufacturing (3-D printing) fabrication. The 3-D printed composites utilize carbon fiber bundles to reinforce nylon/chopped fiber resin in a multilayered structure configuration. Single-edge (60 degrees) notched samples were printed using Mark Two printer. Three reinforcement schemes were designed and used to manufacture the specimens. The focus was placed on selective reinforcement at the crack tip to arrest crack initiation. The mechanical properties, fracture toughness, and fracture behavior of the printed composites were evaluated. It was found that wrapping fiber around the notch effectively blunted the notch and redirected crack propagation away from the notch tip, thereby lengthening the crack path and leading to improved fracture resistance. It was also found that such improvement reaches a saturation level. Excessive notch reinforcement beyond optimal limit can reverse the gains in fracture resistance due to notch-targeted reinforcement. Examination of the fracture surface morphology of the printed composites reveals lack of fusion of the sizing of the individual continuous carbon fiber bundles and the lack of adhesion between the matrix layers (nylon/chopped fiber resin) and the adjacent carbon fiber bundle reinforcement. Damage to the fibers within the carbon bundle was also observed. Thus, a synergetic effect of the carbon fiber bundles reinforcement and the matrix requires more optimization to manufacture carbon-reinforced polymer composites using 3-D printing.

They are amongst the most commonly used plastics, and many polyolefin grades are regarded as engineering polymers. The two main additive manufacturing techniques that can be used to fabricate 3D-printed parts are fused filament fabrication and selective laser sintering. Polyolefins, like polypropylene and polyethylene, can, in principle, be processed with both these techniques. However, the semi-crystalline nature of polyolefins adds complexity to the use of additive manufacturing methods compared to amorphous polymers. First, the crystallization process results in severe shrinkage upon cooling, while the processing temperature and cooling rate affect the mechanical properties and mesoscopic structure of the fabricated parts. In addition, for ultra-high-molecular weight polyolefins, limited chain diffusion is a major obstacle to achieving proper adhesion between adjunct layers. Finally, polyolefins are typically apolar polymers, which reduces the adhesion of the 3D-printed part to the substrate. Notwithstanding these difficulties, it is clear that the successful processing of polyolefins via additive manufacturing techniques would enable the fabrication of high-end engineering products with enormous design flexibility. In addition, additive manufacturing could be utilized for the increased recycling of plastics. This manuscript reviews the work that has been conducted in developing experimental protocols for the additive manufacturing of polyolefins, presenting a comparison between the different approaches with a focus on the use of polyethylene and polypropylene grades. This review is concluded with an outlook for future research to overcome the current challenges that impede the addition of polyolefins to the standard palette of materials processed through additive manufacturing.

The dielectric properties, relative permittivity (epsilon r), quality factor (Qxf) and dielectric loss (tan.5) were measured as a function of ceramic solid loading (%) at 5 GHz for 3D printed samples. A relative permittivity epsilon(r) = 6.05, Qxf = 10,433 GHz and dielectric loss tan.5 = 0.007 were obtained for a BST/ABS ceramic polymer composite, with 50 wt% (15 vol%) solid loading. The composite materials exhibit reduced dielectric losses compared to standard laminates currently used in the radiofrequency (RF) and telecommunications industry. Based on polymer/ ceramic composite filament, a prototype microstrip patch 5 G antenna and a hemispherical dielectric lens were designed and manufactured. Through testing, it shows good antenna performance with a centre frequency of f(0) = 3.78 GHz and a (-10 dB) bandwidth of 90.6 MHz. The dielectric lens increased the antenna gain by 3.86 dBi.

Adding small amounts of short carbon fibers to PAEKs enhances their stiffness and service temperature but modifies their processing, structure, and properties. This study examines the effects of the AM method (L-PBF and ME) and carbon fiber addition on the structure, mechanical properties, and crystallinity of three different PAEK polymers. We characterize and correlate tensile properties, fracture modes, degree of crystallinity, fiber length and orientations, and porosity of the samples. Our findings aim to refine AM processes and feedstock materials for semi-crystalline polymers and their composites, offering insights for designing robust, economical AM parts.

In contrast to established fabricated materials, low-meltingpoint alloys (LMPAs) are increasingly attractive because they have favorable electrical/thermal conductivities and mechanical strengths. However, LMPA additive manufacturing is still in its infancy. We report a novel strategy for fabricating the complex and/or multifunctional components of LMPAs by extrusion additive manufacturing with two nozzles (for extruding the polymer and for extruding the LMPA). The proposed strategy was used to successfully fabricate complex LMPA components for the first time. We fabricated LMPA/polymer composite parts with improved mechanical properties, and implemented the integrated manufacturing of circuits and 3D products. The strategy will enable the use of LMPAs in applications such as smart structures, electromagnetic shielding, biomedicine, thermal management, energy harvesting, and advanced electronics.

The goal of this paper is to investigate the processing route in the context of low volume industrial applications and to assess the mechanical performance of hybrid AM-CFRP structures in ultimate strength and fatigue. The approach was applied to lower-limb prostheses using dissolvable in-autoclave tooling made of ST-130 by fused deposition modeling, two load introduction elements made of titanium by selective laser melting, and pre-impregnated carbon fiber reinforcements. The parts were cured in an autoclave at a pressure of 3 bar and a temperature of 110 A degrees C. The inner toolings were dissolved in a basic solution after curing. The prostheses were subjected to ultimate strength and fatigue tests to assess the mechanical performance of the structures. Results show that the target load of 5474 N was exceeded by 40% and that no fatigue failure occurred for the given loading. Weight savings of 28% compared to a state-of-the-art aluminum reference part were achieved. Results demonstrate that the combination of technologies could be appropriate for high-performance lightweight components with complex geometries.

The use of PAM components as a functional part is still insignificant when compared to injection molding components. This is due to marginal mechanical properties of Polymer Additive Manufactured components. The present work is an attempt to determine the mechanical properties of a specimen printed by a polymer material using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technique. The effect of infill percentage and build direction on tensile strength and flexural strength of manufactured ASA parts is compared with similar injection molded parts in literature. Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate (ASA) material is chosen for the present work to do experiments. The part is designed in Creo parametric 4.0 and converted to .stl file format. The specimen is printed using a STRATASYS F-370 FDM machine. It can be concluded that the increase in infill percentage of the ASA material resulted in increased tensile strength along the print direction. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Kumar, S.

Therefore, the use of natural materials and fabrication of composites therefrom, particularly, development of natural fiber reinforced polymer composites is gaining significant attention. Although natural fiber reinforced composites (NFRCs) show strong application prospects, various materials and processing related challenges needs to be addressed to achieve long-term stability and performance. In this review, we attempted to provide an overview of different types of natural fibers, their characteristics and properties enabling them to be used as reinforcing agents in different polymers. Then the unique requirement of fiber surface modification to achieve enhanced fiber-matrix bonding is discussed. The article also discusses conventional processing routes and critical issues associated with NFRCs processing. The use of different additive manufacturing (AM) technologies in processing polymer composites is also discussed. At the end, we have critically analyzed the challenges and opportunities associated with AM of NFRCs.

Many researchers have studied the effect of die design on solid fillers like glass and carbon fibers but there is no research on incorporating immiscible liquid additives which can lead to additive manufacturing of solid parts with a controllable immiscible liquid morphology internal to the part. To accomplish this, experiments must be done to determine the effect of die design on the deformation induced on an immiscible droplet in the flow field. In this research, the feasibility of using shear flows and extensional flows to deform a droplet is first studied. A channel with walls based on a hyperbolic equation can impose a constant stretch rate at the center and makes it easier to model the flow. Applying this principle, a converging channel is built, filled with Silicone oil (Matrix liquid) and subject to hyperbolic flows. The deformation seen by a droplet of immiscible Castor oil is studied for various positions of injection using high speed imagery. It was observed that droplets injected at the center of the channel did not see any significant stretch but the ones injected closer to the walls stretched and reached the affine state. Simulations studies were performed using ANSYS Fluent to find the velocity gradients along each streamline where the droplet was injected. This data, combined with the droplet widths measured from the images, was used to track the Capillary number changes for a given droplet. It was observed that droplets with a higher initial Capillary number saw a steeper reduction than droplets with lower initial Capillary numbers. Further, close examination of the droplet dimensions from each image showed that the droplet width reduced and reached an asymptote in the channel. These results aid in understanding liquid filler behavior in a polymer flow and helps in incorporating liquids in polymer based additive manufacturing.

In this study, we investigated the printing of hybrid metal (Cu10Sn) and polymer (PA11) objects through a proprietary multiple-material laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) system. Powder materials were delivered to the build platform through an ultrasonic vibration-assisted dispensing system. Several 2D Cu10Sn/PA11 structures were printed and demonstrated. The scientific mechanism underlying how the interaction between Cu10Sn and PA11 during laser scanning affected printing quality is discussed. In addition, the roughness of the printed Cu10Sn top surface was improved tenfold with the addition of small amount of PA11 powder. Finally, several 3D components consisting of hybrid stainless steel (SS 316 L), copper (Cu10Sn), and polymer (PA11) including entangling structures were printed and discussed. Potential applications of this technology are discussed.

Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) is a high-grade polymer with exceptional mechanical qualities and heat resistance that is commonly used in aircraft and vehicle manufacture. These polymers are mixed with other materials to create alloys, which are primarily used in the production and fabrication of high-performance engineering thermoplastics. Additive layer manufacturing technologies based on polymer composites have been widely employed in 3D printing for decades. The effect of numerous processing parameters involved in ALM procedures such as FDM of polymer-fibre composites for improved physical and mechanical properties was highlighted in the assessment of polymer materials. This paper also briefly discusses the physical features of FDM-based ALM processes and fibre composites. As a result, the research article provides a systematic study enabling researchers in the relevant engineering sector to evaluate the physical properties of fibre-reinforced polymeric composites created using ALM.

One challenge in the hybrid additive manufacturing lies in the different conditions of individual additive manu-facturing processes. For example, in the combined application of the laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB) of metals with the fused filament fabrication (FFF) of polymers, damage can occur in the plastic due to the higher process-ing temperatures of PBF-LB. Therefore, in this work a process strategy for the buildup of metallic structures in the PBF-LB process on polymer base structures was developed. By reducing the laser energy density in combination with increasing the height of the first layer, a processing window could be identified. The built hybrid compo-nents were investigated with micro-computed tomography and the effects of different processing parameters on the interface between the polymer and metal part are discussed. Finally, a strategy to increase the strength of the interface is presented.

Currently, most polymer AM processes are limited by a narrow field of available and compatible materials. Typical thermoplastics common to the injection molding industry are created from petroleum, a limited and nonrenewable resource and have been widely adopted for use in AM. Recently plastics that are more sustainable, such as polylactic acid (PLA), have started to gain traction as a competitor to these traditional plastics. For this study, cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), cellulose acetate propionate (CAP), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), nylon 11, and polycaprolactone (PCL) were formulated and tested for AM. In addition, ABS and PLA were tested as control materials. Results showed the technical feasibility of some bioplastics for AM.

J	Sanderson, B; Diba, F; Kishawy, H; Hosseini, A				Sanderson, Benjamin; Diba, Fereydoon; Kishawy, Hossam; Hosseini, Ali			Finite element analysis of additive manufacturing of polymers using selective laser sintering	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Selective laser sintering; Finite element analysis; Polymers; Mechanical characteristics; ANSYS additive suite		Additive manufacturing (AM) is experiencing widespread adoption in many sectors including aerospace and biomedical. Several research works have already studied AM to ensure high quality final parts can be consistently achieved. To aid in virtually simulating the additive manufacturing processes, companies like ANSYS have developed simulation packages for their finite element software. These packages have been proven to be effective in predicting and minimizing distortion and warping, but their capability in predicting resultant mechanical characteristics requires further investigation. This paper focuses on using ANSYS Additive Suite (AAS) to predict the mechanical performance of polymer parts produced by a selective laser sintering process. Utilizing AAS, the process of additively manufacturing a tensile test specimen was simulated, followed by simulated tensile loading in ANSYS Mechanical. The output of this simulation was then experimentally verified with physical components. The results show that AAS can increase the accuracy of displacement prediction of a part under load within the elastic region with minimal experimentation required. However, it was also observed that the accuracy starts to decrease when approaching the yield point and consequently entering the plastic region due to the complexity of plastic behavior. When designing, the yield point is a critical design parameter and often considered the limit of a material. The process outlined in this paper allows for validation of AM design to be done faster, cheaper, and with more flexibility than possible using experimental or mathematical methods. Should this process be further refined, generative design possibilities will be significantly more powerful.

Friction and wear of additive manufactured polymers in dry contact	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES			English	Article						Additive Manufacturing; Polyjet technology; Friction; Wear; Surface topography	TRIBOLOGICAL BEHAVIOR; SURFACE-ROUGHNESS; SLIDING WEAR; MECHANISM; RUBBER	The use of additive manufacturing (AM) is widely advancing the scope of rapid prototyping and manufacturing in tribological applications and material science research. However, there is still limited research focused on investigating the frictional and wear performance of AM polymers, especially of Polyjet manufactured parts. This work focuses on the effect of varying the contact load on the friction and wear mechanisms of additively manufactured acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (3D ABS) and Verogray polymers fabricated using Polyjet technology. Loads of 1, 5 and 10 N were applied under dry sliding contact with a 52100 steel counterface at room temperature. Dependence of friction and wear on the surface orientation to the sliding direction is noted. The results demonstrate that at 1 N load, the friction coefficient is primarily dependent on the orientation of the surface to the sliding direction. However, at higher loads of 5 N and 10 N, this dependency is shown to be a function of the bulk material properties rather than the surface roughness. Further correlation between the surface morphology and wear rate is shown to be dependent on the bulk material properties and the applied load. The results from this study provide alternate application uses for Polyjet materials in metal-polymer tribo-contacts for improved friction and wear performance.

The ability to fabricate arbitrarily complex objects has made AM technologies indispensable in personalized healthcare, soft electronics, and renewable energy. At the intersection of AM technologies and materials chemistry are stimuli-responsive polymers, which change their chemical and physical properties in response to specific environmental cues. The responsiveness of these "smart" polymers makes them suitable for AM and provides functionality to the additively manufactured objects. Furthermore, the type and degree of stimulus response of smart polymers can be regulated through precise synthetic design or via incorporation of additives. Herein, we review recently reported stimuli-responsive polymers used in AM, with a focus on the design and chemistry of the polymers. The materials are broadly classified by type of printing, and more specifically classified by type of stimulus response. Finally, we briefly consider existing challenges that stimuli-responsive materials in AM can address in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Shafranek, Ryan T.; Millik, S.

Supramolecular Salts for Additive Manufacturing of Polyimides	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						polyimides; additive manufacturing; photopolymerization; polyetherimides; engineering polymers	AROMATIC POLYIMIDES; NYLON-SALT; POLYMERS; FOAMS	Recent advances in vat photopolymerization (VP) additive manufacturing of fully aromatic polyimides employed photoreactive high-molecular-weight precursors dissolved at modest loadings (<20 wt %) in organic solvent. These earlier efforts revealed high isotropic shrinkage, approaching 52% on a linear basis while converting to the desired polyimide. To increase the polyimide precursor concentration and decrease shrinkage during VP processing of high-performance polyimides, photoreactive fully aromatic polyimide and thermoplastic polyetherimide (PEI) supramolecular salt precursors now serve as versatile alternatives. Both pyromellitic dianhydride-4,4'-oxydianiline (PMDA-ODA) and 4,4'-(4,4'-isopropylidene-diphenoxy)diphthalic anhydride-meta phenylene diamine (BPADA-mPD) supramolecular dicarboxylate-diammonium salts, termed polysalts, provided prerequisite rheological performance and photoreactivity for VP. Solutions (50 wt %) of both photoactive polysalts exhibited viscosities more than two orders of magnitude lower than previously reported polyimide precursor solutions for VP. In addition, VP of 50 wt % polysalt solutions yielded high resolution, self-supporting organogel structures. During thermal postprocessing to the desired fully aromatic polyimide and PEI, photocrosslinked polysalt organogels exhibited retention of part shape in concert with linear isotropic shrinkage of only 26%, the lowest reported value using organogel strategies for VP of fully aromatic polyimides. Furthermore, the imidized structures exhibited comparable thermal and mechanical properties to analogous polyimides synthesized using classical methodologies for 2D films. The combination of facile synthesis and increased precursor concentrations designates polysalt polyimide precursors as a versatile platform for additive manufacturing of well-defined 3D polyimide structures.

When combined with the innovation and technological advances of additive manufacturing, the use of bioresorbable polymers could prove tremendous to the development of custom bioresorbable implants. However, a key question for the use of thermoplastic-based resorbable polymers lies in the potential changes in properties experienced during manufacturing, and thus the effect of process parameters on the performance of the final device is of critical importance. Specific resorbable materials are selected for mechanical and resorption rate properties based on bulk measurements. The implanted mechanical properties of a device are significantly affected by processing parameters and are the leading concern of clinicians during development and patient use of a new device. In this work, additive manufacturing of medical grade polymers and copolymers of L-lactide, E-caprolactone were extruded into filaments of 1.75 mm in diameter and printed at different infill percentages. The molecular, thermal, and mechanical properties of homopolymers of L-lactide and E-caprolactone, along with a unique copolymer of L-lactide, E-caprolactone, and trimethylene carbonate, Lactoflex 7415 were evaluated. Through variance of material composition and the infill parameter of AM, an order of magnitude range in tensile strength and modulus properties were observed as feasible and optimizable.

Herein, we present an extendable multi-material projection microstereolithography process capable of producing carbonfiber-reinforced cellular materials that achieve simultaneously high specific stiffness and damping coefficient. Inspired by the upper bounds of stiffness-loss coefficient in a two-phase composite, we designed and additively manufactured CFRP microlattices with soft phases architected into selected stiff-phase struts. Our results, confirmed by experimental and analytical calculations, revealed that the damping performance can be significantly enhanced by the addition of only a small fraction of the soft phase. The presented design and additive manufacturing strategy allow for optimizing mutually exclusive properties. As a result, these CFRP microlattices achieved high specific stiffness comparable to commercial CFRP, technical ceramics, and composites, while being dissipative like elastomers.

Treatments were carried out in a helium discharge with either oxygen or nitrogen addition. The plasma activated polymer particles were then used to prepare filaments, which in-turn were then used to fabricated parts by additive manufacturing. The resultant dog bone polymer parts exhibited up to a 22% increase in tensile strength, compared to parts fabricated using unactivated polymer particles. The explanation for the increased mechanical strength is the enhanced activation of the treated polymer particles, as well as the removal of contaminations from the polymer surface. [GRAPHICS] .

In this context, this research article presents new processing strategies in the field of polymer- and metal-based multi-material AM. The investigation highlights the current progress in powder-based multi-material AM based on three successfully utilized technological approaches: additive and formative manufacturing of hybrid metal parts with locally adapted and tailored properties, material-efficient AM of multi-material polymer parts through electrophotography, and the implementation of UV-curable thermosets within the laser-based powder bed fusion of plastics. Owing to the complex requirements for the mechanical testing of multi-material parts with an emphasis on the transition area, this research targets an experimental shear testing set-up as a universal method for both metal- and polymer-based processes. The method was selected based on the common need of all technologies for the sufficient characterization of the bonding behavior between the individual materials.

J	Cunico, MM; de Carvalho, J				Cunico, Marlon Wesley Machado; de Carvalho, Jonas			Development of additive manufacturing technology based on selective metal-polymer composite formation	RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Selective composite formation; Metal-polymer composite	MICRO-STEREOLITHOGRAPHY	Purpose - During the past years, numerous market segments have increasingly adopted additive manufacturing technologies for product development and complex parts design. Consequently, recent developments have expanded the technologies, materials and applications in support of emerging needs, in addition to improving current processes. The present work aims to propose and characterise a new technology that is based on selective formation of metal-polymer composites with low power source. Design/methodology/approach - To develop this project, the authors have divided this work in three parts: material development, process feasibility and process optimisation. For the polymeric material development, investigation of metallic and composite materials assessed each material's suitability for selective composite formation besides residual material removal. The primary focus was the evaluation of proposed process feasibility. The authors applied multivariable methods, where the main responses were line width, penetration depth, residual material removal feasibility, layer adherence strength, mechanical strength and dimensional deviation of resultant object. The laser trace speed, distance between formation lines and laser diameter were the main variables. Removal agent and polymeric material formulation were constants. In the last part of this work, the authors applied a multi-objective optimisation. The optimisation objectives minimized processing time and dimensional deviation while maximizing mechanical strength in xy direction and mechanical strength in z direction. Findings - With respect to material development, the polymeric material tensile strength was found between 30 and 45 MPa at break. It was also seen that this material has low viscosity before polymerized ( between 2 and 20 cP) essential for composite formation and complete material removal. In that way, the authors also identified that the residual material removal process was possible by redox reaction. In contrast with that the final object was marked by the polymer which covers the metallic matrix, protecting the object protects against chemical reactions. For the feasibility study, the authors identified the process windows for adherence between composite layers, demonstrating the process feasibility. The composite mechanical strength was shown to be between 120 and 135 MPa in xy direction and between 35 and 45 MPa in z direction. In addition, the authors have also evidenced that the geometrical dimensional distortion might vary until 5 mm, depending on process configuration. Despite that, the authors identified an optimised configuration that exposes the potential application of this new technology. As this work is still in a preliminary development stage, further studies are needed to be done to better understand the process and market segments wherein it might be applied. Originality/value - This paper proposed a new and innovative additive manufacturing technology which is based on metal-polymer composites using low power source. Additionally, this work also described studies related to the investigation of concept feasibility and proposed process characterisation. The authors have focused on material development and studied the functional feasibility, which at the same time might be useful to the development of other additive manufacturing processes.

In this study, producibility of polymer matrix continuous fiber reinforced composite parts was investigated for the composite additive manufacturing method. For this purpose, a system that can produce composite fiber using UV light curing epoxy resin as matrix material and continuous glass/carbon fiber bundles as reinforcement material has been developed. Photocurable epoxy resin in liquid form and fiber bundle are fed through a nozzle, the photopolymer is cured in the exit of nozzle with a coaxial UV light source that mounted on the head. As a result of the experiments, it has been observed that the matrix material completely encompasses the reinforcement material bundle, the curing process of the matrix material with the UV light source is provided and thus, composite fiber production can be carried out in the direction of the nozzle axis. Because of the opacity, carbon fibers block UV light, so the photopolymer resin at the inner section of the fiber bundle cannot be cured, so carbon fiber reinforced composite fiber production has failed. However, this shading problem was not observed with glass fiber reinforced samples. Thus, it has been demonstrated that glass fiber reinforcement material is more suitable than carbon fiber material in terms of producing polymer matrix continuous fiber reinforced composite parts by additive manufacturing method.

The use of materials with high strength to weight ratio, and more specifically continuous fibre-reinforced composites, has demonstrated potential when fabricated through fused filament fabrication (FFF). The development and evaluation of such technologies has attracted a lot of attention in recent years, from both academic researchers and from industry, and a plethora of different techniques for its achievement has been proposed. This review presents different methods of FFF for the fabrication of continuous fibre-reinforced composite components as described in both patent and scholarly research literature. Different print head designs and techniques for combining and depositing polymers reinforced with continuous fibre have been developed including pre-impregnation, the use of multiple nozzles for the separate deposition of the fibre and the matrix material, and in situ impregnation of the reinforcing fibre with the matrix material. This review identifies the challenges associated with each of these approaches such as achieving a successful fibre/matrix impregnation, cutting of the continuous fibres during processing, and the introduction of high-performance thermoplastic polymers as the matrix material.

Our approach is based on a fast and inexpensive thiol-ene free radical addition that can be applied for different classes of preceramic polymers with carbon-carbon double bonds. Due to the rapidity and efficiency of the thiol-ene click reactions, this additive manufacturing process can be effectively carried out using conventional light sources on benchtop printers. Through light initiated cross-linking, the liquid preceramic polymers transform into stable infusible thermosets that preserve their shape during the polymer-to-ceramic transformation. Through pyrolysis the thermosets transform into glassy ceramics with uniform shrinkage and high density. The obtained ceramic structures are nearly fully dense, have smooth surfaces, and are free from macroscopic voids and defects. A fabricated SiOC honeycomb was shown to exhibit a significantly higher compressive strength to weight ratio in comparison to other porous ceramics.

Due to its high electrical conductivity graphene can decrease the electrical resistance of otherwise insulating polymers by several orders of magnitude once the filler content is above the electrical percolation threshold. Nevertheless, the processing parameters and geometrical conditions have significant influence on the electrical conductivity. Due to the anisotropic character of additive manufactured parts the slicing, filling strategies and building direction as well as the processing parameters like extruder temperature, printing speed, layer width and thickness strongly determine the final conductivity of the printed path. To measure the resistance of the composite a DC power supply and a digital multimeter was used. The structure of the specimens was examined by computer tomography. An electric torch as demonstrator was realized successfully.

Every layer represents a narrow cross section of the component generated from the CAD data file. Each layer in ALM must have a defined part thickness, and the final part will be an estimate of the actual data. The last element will be the thinner surface of each layer that is formed. Modern and sophisticated ALM machines operate on a layer-based philosophy and methodology, which differs from traditional processes in terms of the materials utilised in component manufacture, the final layers formed, and how the layers are bonded to one another. These margins will look at things like the end part's correctness, as well as its material and mechanical qualities. We will determine several criteria in this study, such as how quickly the part can be manufactured utilising various ALM procedures. We also explore the beginnings of addi-tive layer manufacturing and introduce the basic notion of additive layer manufacturing in this work. It will also go over the design process for additive layer manufacturing as well as the whole production of polymer composite based components tools. For functional engineering environments, polymer material is commonly employed to create hard and robust plastic parts. This material is extremely long-lasting, and it can be made or even welded if necessary. A minor change in the characteristics of the same mate-rial can make a big difference. ALM can be helpful at this point since it allows the designer to create a tangible model of the product to show its use and functions.Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Additive manufacturing of heat-sensitive polymer melt using a pellet-fed material extrusion	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Three-dimensional printing; Polyvinyl alcohol; Thermal decomposition; Material extrusion	POLYVINYL-ALCOHOL; THERMAL-DECOMPOSITION; POLY(VINYL ALCOHOL); FUSED DEPOSITION; FABRICATION; SCAFFOLDS; TINOPAL	The most common method for Additive Manufacturing (AM) of polymers is melt extrusion, which normally requires several pre-processing steps to compound and extrude filament feedstock, resulting in an overall long melt residency time. Consequently a typical melt extrusion-based AM process is time/cost consuming, and limited in the availability of materials that can be processed. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) is one of the heat sensitive polymers demonstrating a thermal decomposition temperature overlapping its processing window. This study proposed to use a pellet-fed material extrusion technique to directly process PVOH granules without the necessity of using any pre-processing steps. The approach essentially combined compounding, extrusion and AM, allowing multi-material printing with minimum exposure to heat during the process. The processing parameters were determined via thermal and rheological characterisation of PVOH. Effects of processing temperature and time on the thermal decomposition of PVOH were demonstrated, which further affected the tensile properties and solubility. An increase in Young's modulus, stress at 2% strain, and Ultimate Tensile Stress were 98 +/- 4%, 40 +/- 5%, and 20 +/- 2%, respectively, was observed when PVOH residency time was reduced from 25 min to 14 min. The pellet-fed material extrusion technology demonstrated good 3D printability, multi-material printing capability, and great versatility in processing polymer melts.

J	Prajapati, H; Ravoori, D; Jain, A				Prajapati, Hardikkumar; Ravoori, Darshan; Jain, Ankur			Measurement and modeling of filament temperature distribution in the standoff gap between nozzle and bed in polymer-based additive manufacturing	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Polymer extrusion; Infrared thermography; Heat transfer analysis	THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; HEAT-TRANSFER; EXTRUSION	Dispensing of a polymer filament above its glass transition temperature is a critical step in several polymer-based additive manufacturing techniques. While the nozzle assembly heats up the filament prior to dispense, it is important to minimize cooling down of the filament in the standoff distance between the nozzle tip and bed. While heat transfer processes within the nozzle assembly, such as filament melting, and on the bed, such as thermally-driven filament-to-filament adhesion, have been well studied, there is a lack of work on heat transfer in the filament in the standoff region. This paper presents infrared thermography based measurement of temperature distribution in the filament in the standoff region, and an analytical model for heat transfer in this region. The analytical model, based on a balance between thermal advection and convective/radiative heat loss predicts an exponentially decaying temperature distribution, the nature of which is governed by the characteristic length, a parameter that combines multiple process parameters such as mass flowrate, filament diameter, heat capacity and cooling conditions. Experimental data in a wide range of process parameters are found to be in very good agreement with the analytical model. The thermal design space for ensuring minimal temperature drop in the standoff region is explored based on the analytical model. Experimental data and theoretical modeling presented here improve our fundamental understanding of heat transfer in polymer additive manufacturing, and may contribute towards design tools for thermal optimization of these processes.

A new methodology for the system and process capabilities analysis in additive manufacturing, using statistical quality tools for production management, is proposed. A large sample of small specimens of circular shape was manufactured of photopolymer resins using polymer jetting (PolyJet) technology. Two critical geometrical features of the specimen were investigated. The variability of the measurement system was determined by Gage repeatability and reproducibility (Gage R&R) methodology. Machine and process capabilities were performed in relation to the defined tolerance limits and the results were analyzed based on the requirements from the statistical process control. The results showed that the EDEN 350 system capability and PolyJet process capability enables obtaining capability indices over 1.67 within the capable tolerance interval of 0.22 mm. Furthermore, PolyJet technology depositing thin layers of resins droplets of 0.016 mm allows for manufacturing in a short time of a high volume of parts for mass production with a tolerance matching the ISO 286 IT9 grade for radial dimension and IT10 grade for linear dimensions on the Z-axis, respectively. Using microscopy analysis some results were explained and validated from the capability study.

This phenomenon can be used to detect, evaluate, and predict mechanical failures in composites. In this report, we utilized manganese-doped zinc-sulphide (ZnS: Mn) and Polystyrene (PS) composite to fabricate a TL functional part via additive manufacturing. The morphology of the particles inside the polymer matrix were studied using scanning electron microscopy and micro CT scan. Thermoanalytical techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were carried out to evaluate the thermal transitions and degradation of the composites. The mechanoluminescence performance of the printed samples is evaluated by three-point flexural test and observed to depend on processing conditions that can be utilized to achieve a strong light signal at different mechanical loads. The polymer composite fabrication and processing reduced particle size, enhanced particle dispersion, and altered the mechanical properties of the polymer to help increase the mechanoluminescence response up to 10 times in the 3D printed parts. The unique mechanoluminescence properties of 3D printed luminescent composite have great potential for structural monitoring applications.

Interlaminar strengthening of multidirectional laminates using polymer additive manufacturing	MATERIALS & DESIGN			English	Article						Polymer additive manufacturing; Multi-directional Laminates; Interlaminar Shear Strength; Delamination; Finite element analysis	CARBON-FIBER COMPOSITES; MODE-I; FREE-EDGE; FRACTURE-TOUGHNESS; ENHANCEMENT; EXTENSION	A novel approach for improving the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) properties of multi-directional prepreg laminates using polymer additive manufacturing (PAM) technology is proposed in this paper. Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is the PAM technology used for imparting patterns onto carbon prepregs. These modified prepregs are further used for fabricating multi-directional laminates. Prior to manufacturing the laminates, interlaminar regions that are most susceptible to delamination type failure are identified using numerical simulations for selectively reinforcing these critical regions. Next, the influence of printed reinforcements on the ILSS of modified laminates is compared against pristine laminates by conducting short beam shear (SBS) tests. Significant improvement in the ILSS values of up to 28% is observed, which can be attributed to the resistance offered by the printed reinforcements that steered the delamination surfaces along undulated paths as opposed to smooth or straight paths in pristine laminates. Such behavior corroborates the resistance to delamination offered by these printed reinforcements. In summary, this is a pioneering study for exploring the feasibility of using PAM technology for imparting reinforcements at the interlaminar regions in multi-directional laminates with the intention of minimizing delamination.

CF AM is being considered for tooling applications. In AM, CFPCs are usually aligned along the deposition direction; however, it results in anisotropic thermal properties which affect the heat transfer and warpage of the final part. In this study, three male molds with different infill patterns were produced via the material extrusion additive manufacturing (EDF-AM) process. These include (a) 0 degrees: infill pattern along the printing direction; (b) 90 degrees: infill pattern perpendicular to the printing direction; and (c) 0 degrees/90 degrees: alternate layers along and perpendicular directions. The effect of the infill pattern on thermal conductivity was analyzed and observed that 0 degrees infill (surface temperature: 79.2 degrees C) had the highest conductivity; and 90 degrees infill (surface temperature: 66.4 degrees C) had the least. Highlights (for Review): In Additive manufacturing, carbon fibers are usually aligned along the deposition direction; however, it results in anisotropic thermal properties which affect the heat transfer and warpage of the final part.

Ultrasonic additive manufacturing using feedstock with build-in circuitry for 3D metal embedded electronics	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Ultrasonic additive manufacturing; Ultrasonic consolidation; Embedded electronics; 3D electronics; Sheet lamination; Ultrasonic welding; Metal embedded electronics; UAM	MATRIX; STRENGTH	Embedded electronics and sensors are becoming increasingly important for the development of Industry 4.0. For small components, space constraints lead to full 3D integration requirements that are only achievable through Additive Manufacturing. Manufacturing metal components usually require high temperatures incompatible with electronics but Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM) can produce components with mechanical properties close to bulk, but with the integration of internal embedded electronics, sensors or optics. This paper describes a novel manufacturing route for embedding electronics with 3D via connectors in an aluminium matrix. Metal foils with printed conductors and insulators were prepared separately from the UAM process thereby separating the electronics preparation from the part consolidation. A dual material polymer layer exhibited the best electrically insulating properties, while providing mechanical protection of printed conducive tracks stable up to 100 degrees C. General design and UAM process recommendations are given for 3D embedded electronics in a metal matrix.

A healing ability can be integrated in soft robots by manufacturing their soft membranes out of synthetic self-healing polymers, more specifically elastomeric Diels-Alder (DA) networks. As such they can recover completely from macroscopic damage, including scratches, cuts, and ruptures. Before this research, these robots were manufactured using a technique named "shaping-through-folding-and-self-healing." This technique requires extensive manual labor, is relatively slow, and does not allow for complex shapes. In this article, an additive manufacturing methodology, fused filament fabrication, is developed for the thermoreversible DA polymers, and the approach is validated on a soft robotic gripper. The reversibility of their network permits manufacturing these flexible self-healing polymers through reactive printing into the complex shapes required in soft robotics. The degree of freedom in the design of soft robotics that this new manufacturing technique offers is illustrated through the construction of adaptive DHAS gripper fingers, based on the design by FESTO.

J	Pignatelli, F; Percoco, G				Pignatelli, Francesco; Percoco, Gianluca			An application- and market-oriented review on large format additive manufacturing, focusing on polymer pellet-based 3D printing	PROGRESS IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Review						3D printing; Large format additive manufacturing; LFAM; Pellet-based additive manufacturing; Pellet extrusion; Polymers	CARBON-FIBER; COMPOSITES	Since this advent, additive manufacturing (AM) has grown steadily and found applications across all types of sectors. While the great development of such technologies has improved the quality of prints and expanded the availability of materials, AM still has some limitations regarding its physical scaling. This paper will briefly present the state-of-the-art of large-scale additive manufacturing and subsequently greater attention will be given to extrusion-based 3D printing. Specifically, we will discuss about large format additive manufacturing (LFAM) or big area additive manufacturing (BAAM), a technology based on material extrusion born a few years ago. These systems are characterized by higher deposition rate and lower costs of the material compared to fused filament fabrication (FFF) printers; moreover, they allow to obtain parts with better properties (e.g., adding carbon or glass fibers). The world of research has shown great interest in large-scale material extrusion technologies, which appear to be quite competitive with conventional manufacturing processes and which will find increasing application in the industrial field. With the aim of developing a tool for orienting researchers and technicians in this complex field, the present paper presents a systematic review of the actual market of machines, the research in extrudable materials and related applications concerning large-scale 3D printing, and in particular the LFAM.

Directed Assembly of Particles for Additive Manufacturing of Particle-Polymer Composites	MICROMACHINES			English	Review						directed assembly; additive manufacturing; external fields; 3D printing; particle-polymer composites	IRON-OXIDE NANOPARTICLES; CARBON NANOTUBES; ELECTROPHORETIC DEPOSITION; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; COMPUTER-SIMULATION; COLLOIDAL PARTICLES; INDUCED ALIGNMENT; ACOUSTIC CONTROL	Particle-polymer dispersions are ubiquitous in additive manufacturing (AM), where they are used as inks to create composite materials with applications to wearable sensors, energy storage materials, and actuation elements. It has been observed that directional alignment of the particle phase in the polymer dispersion can imbue the resulting composite material with enhanced mechanical, electrical, thermal or optical properties. Thus, external field-driven particle alignment during the AM process is one approach to tailoring the properties of composites for end-use applications. This review article provides an overview of externally directed field mechanisms (e.g., electric, magnetic, and acoustic) that are used for particle alignment. Illustrative examples from the AM literature show how these mechanisms are used to create structured composites with unique properties that can only be achieved through alignment. This article closes with a discussion of how particle distribution (i.e., microstructure) affects mechanical properties. A fundamental description of particle phase transport in polymers could lead to the development of AM process control for particle-polymer composite fabrication. This would ultimately create opportunities to explore the fundamental impact that alignment has on particle-polymer composite properties, which opens up the possibility of tailoring these materials for specific applications.

For those purposes a post-treatment of the compo-nents, e.g. surface coating with metals, is crucial. Electroplating on polymers, like ABS (terpolymer of acrylo-nitrile, butadiene and styrene), is an established industrial process applied on components manufactured by standard technologies, like injection molding. It consists of various steps - from cleaning over creating electric conductivity on the non-conducting polymer surface towards galvanic coating with metals. In this publication, the challenges in transferring this process to additive manufactured ABS components are analyzed by focusing on the surface quality. Surface quality is evaluated by macroscopic imaging and different microscopic technologies (transmission light microscopy, laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy). The success of electroplating processes on plastics strongly depends on the nature of the plastic surfaces and therefore on the additive manufacturing parameters applied. The used additive technology of fused deposition modelling is characterized by the deposition of single plastic strands. Adjustments of selected manufacturing parameters, such as the layer thickness and the overlap of the stored plastic strands, create the conditions of homogenous and well adhering metal coatings. According to the surface topology from this additive manufacturing process, pre-treatment with levelling and sealing the surface is identified as important challenge towards success and reproducibility of electroplating process.

The ability to manufacture complex designs that can maximize strength while reducing weight in an automated fashion has made 3D-printed composites a popular research target in the field of engineering. However, a significant amount of understanding and basic research is still necessary to decode the fundamental process mechanisms of combining enhanced functionality and additively manufactured composites. In this review, external field-assisted additive manufacturing techniques for polymer composites are discussed with respect to (1) self-assembly into complex microstructures, (2) control of fiber orientation for improved interlayer mechanical properties, and (3) incorporation of multi-functionalities such as electrical conductivity, self-healing, sensing, and other functional capabilities. A comparison between reinforcement shapes and the type of external field used to achieve mechanical property improvements in printed composites is addressed. Research has shown the use of such materials in the production of parts exhibiting high strength-to-weight ratio for use in aerospace and automotive fields, sensors for monitoring stress and conducting electricity, and the production of flexible batteries.

In recent years, additive manufacturing (AM) aka 3D printing technology of these SRPs, also known as 4D printing, has gained phenomenal attention in different engineering fields, thanks to its unique ability to develop complex, personalized, and innovative structures, which undergo twisting, elongating, swelling, rolling, shrinking, bending, spiraling, and other complex morphological transformations. Herein, an effort has been made to provide insightful information about the AM techniques, type of SRPs, and their applications including, but not limited to tissue engineering, soft robots, bionics, actuators, sensors, construction, and smart textiles. This article also incorporates the current challenges and prospects, hoping to provide an insightful basis for the utilization of this technology in different engineering fields. It is expected that the amalgamation of 3D printing with SRPs would provide unparalleled advantages in different engineering arenas.

Using ME-AM for core-shell manufacturing offers improved mechanical properties and dimensional accuracy over conventional 3D-printed polymer. Operating parameters play an important role in forming the overall quality of the 3D-printed manufactured products. Here we use numerical simulations within the framework of computation fluid dynamics (CFD) to identify the best combination of operating parameters for the 3D printing of a core-shell polymer strand. The objectives of these CFD simulations are to find strands with an ultimate volume fraction of core polymer. At the same time, complete encapsulations are obtained for the core polymer inside the shell one. In this model, the deposition flow is controlled by three dimensionless parameters: (i) the diameter ratio of core material to the nozzle, d/D; (ii) the normalised gap between the extruder and the build plate, t/D; (iii) the velocity ratio of the moving build plate to the average velocity inside the nozzle, V/U. Numerical results of the deposited strands' cross-sections demonstrate the effects of controlling parameters on the encapsulation of the core material inside the shell and the shape and size of the strand. Overall we find that the best operating parameters are a diameter ratio of d/D=0.7, a normalised gap of t/D=1, and a velocity ratio of V/U=1.

The binomial consisting of materials performance for the intended application and the most suitable AM process and its production strategy is solved by the application of a multicriteria approach along with a stringency level methodology. The case study has been the analysis of physical and radiation tolerance features of thermoplastic nature candidates for the additive manufacture of mechanical, electromechanical, and electrical components for harsh environments in a nuclear power plant. The obtained results allow select an AM route along with a production strategy based on large batches or small batches. Using a selective laser sintering additive manufacturing route, PP + EPDM can be a good option to manufacture mechanical heavily stressed components, whereas PA can be a versatile material to manufacture friction components or films and sheets for electrical applications. In addition, PE would be a good option for high voltage insulation. Finally, PS would be used in radio frequency and microwave applications. On the other hand, fused deposition modeling techniques are more suitable for several materials, such as PC for mechanical applications, PE for electromechanical applications, and IR for electrical/electronic applications.

J	Akhoundi, B; Modanloo, V; Mashayekhi, A				Akhoundi, Behnam; Modanloo, Vahid; Mashayekhi, Ahmad			Design and manufacture of an additive manufacturing printer based on 3D melt electrospinning writing of polymer	INTERNATIONAL POLYMER PROCESSING			English	Article						3D melt electrospinning writing of polymer; additive manufacturing; electrospinning; fiber diameter; nano-fiber		Objectives: Electrospinning is one of the most well-known approaches to producing polymer nanofibers from a polymer solution by applying a potential difference (voltage) between the spinner and the collector, which is used in various industries such as medicine and military. This method has some significant restrictions, like low process efficiency due to the evaporation of the solvent, remaining solvent on the fibers, which are sometimes toxic, and inability to control the geometry of the produced fibers. On the other hand, preparing some solvents used in the electrospinning of polymer solutions is costly. Polymer melt electrospinning writing is a replacement for this type of electrospinning, which can be mentioned in terms of economy, efficiency, and production of solvent-free fibers. Therefore, in this research, a melt polymer electrospinning device was designed and manufactured according to existing extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) devices (3D printer). Methods: Changes in an extrusion-based 3D printer to convert it into a writing electrospinning device experimentally. Results: PLA and PCL fibers with diameters ranging from 8 to 84 mu m were produced. The effect of process variables on the produced fibers' diameter was investigated: Applied potential difference between the nozzle and the substrate: As its increases, the fiber diameter decreases. Increasing temperature: As its increases, the fiber diameter decreases. Distance between the nozzle and the substrate: As its increases, the fiber diameter increases. Flow rate: As its increases, the fiber diameter increases. Conclusions: By presenting a 3D printer-electrospinning device, it is possible to control the fiber's diameter and the 3D geometry in the 3D printing-electrospinning process.

Experimental analysis of an extrusion system for additive manufacturing based on polymer pellets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Polymer extrusion; Granule feeding; Pellets; Degradation; Polypropylene	SCAFFOLDS	One of the most popular additive manufacturing (AM) processes is based on polymer extrusion using a continuous filament as feedstock. However, the use of this type of feedstock increases costs and narrows the variety of materials that can be used. The development of technologies that allow polymer pellets to be processed as feedstock would increase the popularity of polymer extrusion by addressing these two issues. This work describes the development of a piston-driven extrusion head that can extrude polypropylene granules into a filament. The head was designed to minimize the volume of material fused during the extrusion process and reduce the effect of material degradation. Experiments were conducted to characterize the dimensions of the filaments generated. Material degradation inside the extrusion head was assessed by infrared spectroscopy, and its effect on filament strength was analyzed by tensile tests. The results showed that the system was able to produce a continuous filament. Spectroscopy revealed that degradation occurs inside the heated cylinder but does not greatly influence the strength of the extrudate. However, a flow variation along the length of the filament was observed. For the proposed system to be considered feasible for AM, this variation needs to be better understood and controlled.

J	Lee, C; Tarbutton, JA				Lee, ChaBum; Tarbutton, Joshua A.			Electric poling-assisted additive manufacturing process for PVDF polymer-based piezoelectric device applications	SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES			English	Article						additive manufacturing; electric poling; polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF); 3D printing; polymer processing	VINYLIDENE FLUORIDE; NANOGENERATOR; SENSORS; ENERGY	This paper presents a new additive manufacturing (AM) process to directly and continuously print piezoelectric devices from polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymeric filament rods under a strong electric field. This process, called 'electric poling-assisted additive manufacturing or EPAM, combines AM and electric poling processes and is able to fabricate free-form shape piezoelectric devices continuously. In this process, the PVDF polymer dipoles remain well-aligned and uniform over a large area in a single design, production and fabrication step. During EPAM process, molten PVDF polymer is simultaneously mechanically stresses in-situ by the leading nozzle and electrically poled by applying high electric field under high temperature. The EPAM system was constructed to directly print piezoelectric structures from PVDF polymeric filament while applying high electric field between nozzle tip and printing bed in AM machine. Piezoelectric devices were successfully fabricated using the EPAM process. The crystalline phase transitions that occurred from the process were identified by using the Fourier transform infrared spectroscope. The results indicate that devices printed under a strong electric field become piezoelectric during the EPAM process and that stronger electric fields result in greater piezoelectricity as marked by the electrical response and the formation of sharper peaks at the polar beta crystalline wavenumber of the PVDF polymer. Performing this process in the absence of an electric field does not result in dipole alignment of PVDF polymer. The EPAM process is expected to lead to the widespread use of AM to fabricate a variety of piezoelectric PVDF polymer-based devices for sensing, actuation and energy harvesting applications with simple, low cost, single processing and fabrication step.

Different academic studies prove that additive manufacturing methods can be applied on glass materials using powder or fiber based material sources. In terms of quartz glass, with melting temperatures around 2200 degrees C, laser sources are used to achieve the necessary intensities. In the present study, additive manufacturing of quartz glass is achieved by melting a quartz glass fiber with a CO2 laser source. A combined laser head focusses the laser radiation onto the glass fiber in order to melt the fiber. A three axis system is used to move the printing stage and glass substrate. The experimental investigations show that CO2-laser glass deposition printing allows for the creation of arbitrary 3D quartz glass structures. This method is envisioned to replace conventional manual glass manufacturing processes for production of complex hollow glass structures which are present in the medical sector. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Hang Tuah; Mustapha, Faizal; Ismail, Mohd Idris Shah			A Study on Properties of Polymer-Based Additive Manufacturing	JURNAL KEJURUTERAAN			English	Article						Additive Manufacturing; 3D Printing; Rapid Prototyping; Polymer		In recent years, increasing interest in 3D Printing (3DP) has meant that printer usage is not limited to industrial purposes only, but is also for domestic usage by hobbyists for their individual needs. Polymer-based part production can now even be conducted outside the traditional factory environment. However, low grade printers pose some drawbacks, such as lower heat for material fusion, uncontrolled open ambience and limited nozzle size. These reduce the mechanical and aesthetical qualities as compared to parts fabricated using industrial grade printers. The study aims to perform some quality comparisons between 3D printed polymeric parts fabricated by both industrial and low cost printers, and subsequently to prove the hypothesis that the industrial grade printed part has a more reliable surface quality and mechanical properties. Specimens were fabricated using each printer type (Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) represents the low cost printer and the Multi Jet Printer (MJP) is used for the industrial grade) and later tested for hardness and surface roughness. Comparisons were then made between different fabricating methods and also based on a literature study according to the type of materials. The experiments showed that both the surface roughness and hardness for the plastic parts fabricated by the industrial grade printer were better than those made by the domestic printer, and showed a good agreement with the results in the literature study. Therefore, for highly durable parts, it is suggested that industrial grade printers are used. One point to conclude the study, Rapid Prototyping is possible by any machine, but for Rapid Manufacturing that requires higher durability, it is better to use an industrial grade printer.

Low-pressure additive manufacturing of continuous fiber-reinforced polymer composites	POLYMER COMPOSITES			English	Article						3D printing; additive manufacturing; fiber-reinforced polymeric composite; low pressure; vacuum	CARBON-FIBER; PERFORMANCE; FABRICATION; GLASS	Continuous fiber-reinforced polymer composites have found a wide range of applications in the automotive and aerospace industry due to their lightweight properties. Recently the use of additive manufacturing (AM) has been developed for the fabrication of these composites. This study investigates the use of both atmospheric and, for the first time, low-pressure (1 Pa) processing conditions for the AM of continuous carbon, glass, and Kevlar fiber-reinforced nylon composites. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to compare the thermal properties of the three types of fiber-reinforced filament prior to printing. It was found that the melting peak was dependent on filament type, which can be related to the polymer processing conditions used during their fabrication. Based on computed tomography measurements, it was found that the use of low-pressure printing conditions yielded a reduction in porosity for the carbon, glass, and Kevlar printed composites of 5.7%, 1.0%, and 1.7%, respectively. The mechanical properties of the composites were compared, using a short beam shear test, which assisted in the measurement of interlaminar properties. An increase in interlaminar shear strength of 33%, 22%, and 12% was obtained for the carbon, glass, and Kevlar fiber-reinforced polymer composites, respectively, when printed under low pressure, compared with that obtained at atmospheric pressure.

Polymers come with a wide range of material properties and can be processed via several different AM processes. Adding anisotropy to polymeric composites opens new applications for polymer AM by earning additional functionality and creating composites with tailored properties. One of the new approaches in creating tailored anisotropic composites is pairing external fields that can exert force on fillers and manipulate them inside polymeric matrices. Four main types of external fields - shear, acoustic, magnetic, and electrical - are devised to control filler orientation and concentration in polymeric composites. This review highlights the recent research advances in field-assisted additive manufacturing technologies with the goal of creating polymeric composites with controlled anisotropy orientation and concentration.

A popular application for CF-ABS is printed molds using large scale additive manufacturing (AM) processes produced for a variety of composites end-users. Other applications have not been fully realized as CF-ABS currently has a higher cost than other polymer composite feedstocks. The cost of CF-ABS could be greatly reduced if recycled CF-ABS material was accepted and utilized industrially, which would further expand its application space. The impacts of mechanical recycling on the properties and performance of CF-ABS after AM or other processes are not yet fully understood. As such, most AM CF-ABS is discarded as waste after use. In this work, AM CF-ABS molds used for concrete castings were recycled using an industrial shredder/granulator sys-tem. The granulate was then used as feedstock for large area AM to print test specimens. The elastic moduli in the printing direction and transverse to printing direction after mechanical recycling were found to decrease by 25% and 10%, respectively, most likely caused by reductions in the fiber content and polymer molecular weight. It was found that a significant portion of carbon fiber is lost during mechanical recycling through dust generation, while the thermomechanical extrusion during printing caused the polymer degradation. Although the me-chanical performance of CF-ABS was reduced after recycling, the recycled feedstock retained properties for reuse as printed molds using large area AM or another suitable application.

Measurement and modeling of how temperature distribution on the platform bed changes with time during the dispensing of a polymer filament is of particular interest, as it determines the effectiveness of merging with neighboring filaments, and therefore, the properties of the built part. This paper reports infrared thermography based measurement of temperature field on the platform bed as a function of time during filament dispense and comparison with an analytical model based on moving heat source theory. Measurements identify two key heat transfer processes that influence temperature distribution on the bed. Data show that diffusion of thermal energy deposited on the bed with the filament and heat transfer from the hot nozzle tip both influence the temperature distribution on the bed. The relative contributions of these two sources of temperature rise on the bed are measured for different values of key process parameters. Measurement of temperature rise due to diffusion of thermal energy deposited on the bed is found to be in excellent agreement with an analytical model based on moving heat source theory. Evolution of the temperature field after completion of rastering of a line is measured. These data play a critical role in determining how effectively a filament merges with neighboring filaments. By identifying the key heat transfer processes that determine the temperature field on the platform bed, this work contributes towards thermal optimization of polymer-based additive manufacturing.

It has been estimated that one out of every ten new synthetic compounds is a liquid crystal, mainly due to the fact that liquid crystals have been used in Liquid Crystalline Displays (LCDs) for over 50 years. Liquid crystals, often referred to as mesogens, exhibit an unique range of ordered mesophases with anisotropic physical properties, such as optical, magnetic and dielectric anisotropy, for example. These highly anisotropic properties and the ability of liquid crystals to self-organize on surfaces, has led to them being, are used in a wide range of non-LCD applications. These applications include photochromics, pressure sensitive paints, optical retarders and optical compensation films, etc. Highly crosslinked, anisotropic polymer networks, derived from photopolymerisable liquid crystals, so-called reactive mesogens (RMs), have enabled solution-fabricated organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) for plastic electronics. This review will be focus on the relatively recent application of liquid crystals, i.e., the 3D/4D printing of reactive mesogens and subsequent polymerization to form anisotropic polymer networks in advanced additive manufacturing applications. It will highlight the challenges of the synthesis and use of new liquid crystalline materials in 3D/4D printing for additive manufacturing applications. It will show how the study of the successful development of design strategies for the synthesis of novel liquid crystals for flat panel displays is inspiring the development of novel photopolymerisable liquid crystals for additive manufacturing. It is intended that this review will serve to inspire chemists, with little or no knowledge of liquid crystals, or liquid crystal chemists, to design and synthesize new liquid crystals for 3D/4D printing.

However, the processability of self-healing materials has yet to be studied, limiting the application of rich self-healing mechanisms. Additive manufacturing effectively improves the shortcomings of conventional processing while increasing production speed, accuracy, and complexity, offering great promise for self-healing polymer applications. This article summarizes the current self-healing mechanisms of self-healing polymers and their corresponding additive manufacturing methods, and provides an outlook on future developments in the field.

By mixing particle-filled and neat resins on demand, it is possible to functionally grade both the material structure and the resulting properties of the parts. This research investigates a two-part shape memory polymer in which an epoxy resin is combined with a curing agent to yield a thermoset polymer part with structural integrity and shape memory properties. Magneto-active iron oxide particles are added to the epoxy resin to create a filled resin that is mixed on demand with neat epoxy resin and curing agent; control over the mixing and deposition results in a customized distribution of iron oxide content spatially within a part. After characterizing the shape memory properties of the matrix epoxy, the magneto-active composites are shape programmed and actuated via the application of thermal and magnetic fields, respectively, and the effect of the functional grading on the magneto-active properties of the shape memory polymer is demonstrated. Analytical models are derived to predict the magnetic field-responsive behavior of the thermoset composites.

Polymers and bioactive glasses (BGs) are popular materials for scaffold production because of their tunable properties and ability to interact with the body for effective tissue regeneration. Due to their composition and amorphous structure, BGs possess a significant affinity with the recipient's tissue. Additive manufacturing (AM), a method that allows the creation of complex shapes and internal structures, is a promising approach for scaffold production. However, despite the promising results obtained so far, several challenges remain in the field of TE. One critical area for improvement is tailoring the mechanical properties of scaffolds to meet specific tissue requirements. In addition, achieving improved cell viability and controlled degradation of scaffolds is necessary to ensure successful tissue regeneration. This review provides a critical summary of the potential and limitations of polymer/BG scaffold production via AM covering extrusion-, lithography-, and laser-based 3D-printing techniques. The review highlights the importance of addressing the current challenges in TE to develop effective and reliable strategies for tissue regeneration.

Vibrational Microfeeding of Polymer and Metal Powders for Locally Graded Properties in Powder-Based Additive Manufacturing	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE			English	Article						additive manufacturing; in situ alloying; polymers and plastics; powder metallurgy; powder bed fusion; titanium	FLOWABILITY	Subject of this work is the contact mechanical properties and flowability of polymer and metal powders when they are dispensed on the surface of a powder bed for use in laser-based powder bed fusion in additive manufacturing. Generating local part properties in metal as well as polymer-based powder bed fusion processes is of high interest, so an approach is made to locally add additives by a vibrational microfeeding system for metal and polymer powders. To realize a controlled powder discharge, the behavior of additives, which are dropped on a surface and on a powder bed is analyzed. Influencing factors for mass flow of the powders will be excitation frequency, excitation amplitude and capillary diameter on the side of experimental setup as well as particle size distribution and physical properties on the material side.

To achieve this goal, a transversely isotropic hyperelastic-viscoplastic model is proposed, which considers the effects of strain rate, pressure, temperature; and printing direction. In addition, a modified Tsai-Wu failure criterion is proposed to predict the macroscopic failure of glassy polymers with strain softening. The proposed model is applied to simulate the deformation and failure of additive manufactured lattice structures. Experimental and simulation results indicate that the mechanical behavior of additive manufactured lattice structures depends on not only the lattice orientation but also the printing direction.

However, optimization of surface texture quality has not been fully achieved yet. AM surfaces present variable textures that differs according to the AM methods and process parameters. Because of their unusual texture, it is important to evaluate surface properties of metal and polymer parts produced by different AM processes. In this study, it is aimed to define 2D and 3D surface texture of poly-lactic acid (PLA) polymer and AlSi10Mg metal parts manufactured by Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) and Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) respectively. ISO 4287 Ra, Rq and Rz profile roughness parameters were defined by tactile method while ISO 25178 Sa, Sq and Sz areal parameters were measured by optical method. Measurements were taken from up-skin and down-skin of the samples which were in 30 mm diameter and 4 mm thickness. Results were evaluated within themselves and literature studies. Differences between profile and areal surface characterization and need of new specifications were also discussed.

Although the additive manufacturing was mainly used for the rapid-prototyping purposes, with the development of the high-performance thermoplastic materials, the produced components can be applied not only in the laboratory conditions, but also in the real operation. Therefore, it is necessary to consider also the environmental influences that can significantly shorten the component lifetime. This article presents the 3D printing process for the selected thermoplastic polymers and the experimental verification of the strength analysis of the universal sensor holder together with the quantitative and qualitative comparison of their mechanical properties.

Recent progress and perspective in additive manufacturing of EMI shielding functional polymer nanocomposites	NANO RESEARCH			English	Review						additive manufacturing; electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding; functional polymer nanocomposites; stretchable electronics	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; MICROWAVE-ABSORPTION; FE3O4 NANOPARTICLES; MAGNETIC GRAPHENE; COMPOSITES; PERFORMANCE; FABRICATION; REFLECTION; FILAMENT	Because of rapid progress in the electronics industry, the market has faced a huge demand for novel materials in the field of electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding. Conductive functional polymer composites have demonstrated great potential to fulfill this requirement. To synthesize the polymeric composites, functional conductive nanoadditives such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, and MXene are commonly added to polymeric matrices, and the conductive polymer nanocomposites exhibit promising electrical conductivity as well as EMI shielding performance. Additive manufacturing (AM), also referred to as three-dimensional (3D) printing, has been increasingly employed to fabricate complicated geometry components in the medical, aerospace, and automotive industries. AM has also been used to fabricate advanced EMI shielding materials for sensors, supercapacitors, energy storage devices, and flexible electronics. This review aims at introducing the different 3D printing methods applied for the fabrication of EMI shielding polymer nanocomposites. The impact of the AM process on the functionality of the samples is also reviewed. Additionally, the influence of the nanofiller type and amount on the microstructure and performance of the fabricated nanocomposites is discussed. Finally, the prospects and recommended works for future study are outlined.

The SLS process is mainly defined by the beam-matter interaction between powder material, laser radiation and different material characteristics by itself. However the determination of these different material characteristics is problematic because powder material imposes certain requirements that cannot sufficiently be provided by conventional measurement methods. Hence new fundamental investigation methods to determine the optical and thermal material characteristics like the thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity, or the influence of different heating rates on the melting behavior are presented in this paper. The different analysis methods altogether improve the process of understanding to allow recommendations for the future process controlling. (C) 2014 Laser Institute of America.

Here, the effects of fabrication parameters on the vibratory properties of 3D-printed polymer composite beams were studied. A total of 420 vibratory system identification experiments were conducted on 70 additive manufactured cantilever beams. In addition, Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and the finite element method were used to estimate the first natural frequency of the beams. It was found that build parameters change not only the stiffness of the beam, but these build parameters also affect the damping ratio. Furthermore, the frequency response of the beams is amplitude-dependent; this nonlinear effect is important in predicting the behavior of 3D printed structures. The complex relationship between the build parameters and the nonlinear vibratory response points to the possibility of creating tailored vibratory responses of 3D-printed structures. Since vibrations can cause accelerated wear, this work could also be important in determining accurate life cycle predictions of additive manufactured parts.

These great characteristics are accompanied by some recycling difficulties of the final products, particularly originated from the tire waste rubber industry. In this study, recycled tire rubber was incorporated in polymer matrices using selective laser sintering as 3D printing technology. Two polymers were used-polyamide and thermoplastic polyurethane, for their rigid and elastomeric properties, respectively. Polymer composites containing various tire powder amounts, up to 40 wt.%, were prepared by physical blending. The final materials' morphological characteristics, mechanical properties, and thermal stability were evaluated. The proposed ambitious additive manufacturing approach looked over also some of the major aspects to be considered during the 3D printing procedure. In addition, examples of printed prototypes with potential applications were also proposed revealing the potential of the recycled tire rubber-loaded composites.

Earlier classifications of hybrid manufacturing with roots on the utilization of primarily processed raw materials in the form of ingots, sheets, rods, tubes, profiles, powders and pellets are revisited in the light of the emergence of a new type of hybridization resulting from the combination of additive manufacturing with traditional manufacturing processes. Special emphasis is given to the combination of additive manufacturing with forming processes with the twofold objective of (i) increasing the applicability domain of metal additive manufacturing and overcoming its limitations related to low productivity, metallurgical defects, rough surface quality and lack of dimensional precision, and (ii) adding flexibility and fostering new applications of traditional forming processes.

The 3D printing technology presented in this paper combines the conventional inkjet-based printing of ultraviolet (UV) curable polymers with the deposition of either aligned or random nano-scale fiber mats, in between each printed layer. The fibers are first generated using an electrospinning process that produces the roll of fibers. These fibers are then transferred to the part being manufactured using a stamping operation. The process has been proven to manufacture multi-material laminated nanocomposites having different 3D geometries. The dimensional accuracy of the parts is seen to be a function of the interaction between the different UV-curable polymer inks. In general, the addition of the nanofibers in the form of laminates is seen to improve the mechanical properties of the material, with the Young's modulus and the ultimate breaking stress showing the most improvement. The pinning and deflection of micro-cracks by the nano-scale fiber mats has been identified to be the underlying mechanism responsible for these improved mechanical properties. The thermogravimetric analysis reveals that these improvements in the mechanical properties are obtained without drastically altering the thermal degradation pattern of the base polymer.

Emissions from two LFAM machines were monitored during extrusion of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polycarbonate (PC) polymers as well as high-melt-temperature Ultem (poly(ether imide)), polysulfone (PSU), poly(ether sulfone) (PESU), and polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) polymers. Filter samples of particles were collected for quantification of elements and bisphenol A and S (BPA, BPS) and visualization of morphology. Individual gases were quantified on substance-specific media. Aerosol sampling demonstrated that concentrations of elements were generally low for all polymers, with a maximum of 1.6 mg/m(3) for iron during extrusion of Ultem. BPA, an endocrine disruptor, was released into air during extrusion of PC (range: 0.4 +/- 0.1 to 21.3 +/- 5.3 mu g/m(3)). BPA and BPS (also an endocrine disruptor) were released into air during extrusion of PESU (BPA, 2.0-8.7 mu g/m(3); BPS, 0.03-0.07 mu g/m(3)). Work surfaces and printed parts were contaminated with BPA (<8-587 ng/100 cm(2)) and BPS (<0.22-2.5 ng/100 cm(2)). Gas-phase sampling quantified low levels of respiratory irritants (phenol, SO2, toluene, xylenes), possible or known asthmagens (caprolactam, methyl methacrylate, 4-oxopentanal, styrene), and possible occupational carcinogens (benzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde) in air. Characteristics of particles and gases released by high-melt-temperature polymers during LFAM varied, which indicated the need for polymer-specific exposure and risk assessments. The presence of BPA and BPS on surfaces revealed a previously unrecognized source of dermal exposure for additive manufacturing workers using PC and PESU polymers.

A wide range of polymers, from Nylon-12 to thermoplastic polyurethane polymers, can be processed with complex geometry tailored to specific function. However, due to the nature of the layer-by-layer process used in additive manufacturing, high roughness surfaces remain on the parts. To reduce the roughness of the surfaces, a proprietary post-processing method, developed by Additive Manufacturing Technologies, is applied to the surfaces. To monitor and control the finishing of the surfaces, an in-process surface detection instrument has been developed based on machine vision and machine learning. This paper presents the machine learning approach and the effectiveness of the instrument for in-process measurement of the finished surfaces. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Various advancements in fibre composites are emerging because of their increased use in a myriad of applications. One of the popular processing methods is additive manufacturing (AM), however, polymer-fibre composites manufactured through AM have a significantly lower strength compared to the conventional manufacturing processes, for instance, injection moulding. This article is a comprehensive review of the mechanical testing and performance analysis of polymer-fibre composites fabricated through AM, in particular fused deposition modelling (FDM). The review highlights the effect of the various processing parameters, involved in the FDM of polymer-fibre composites, on the observed mechanical properties. In addition, the thermal properties of FDM based fibre composites are also briefly reviewed. Overall, the review article has been structured to provide an impetus for researchers in the concerned engineering domain to gain an insight into the mechanical properties of fibre-reinforced polymeric composites manufactured through AM.

Among all materials, polymers are the highly used materials, by volume, in AM. Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is a simple and cost-effective AM technology that employs mostly thermoplastic-based filaments. While FDM has been available for few decades, novel and versatile feedstock materials compatible with FDM has experienced significant expansion only recently. This report is aimed at providing an overview of the current research and development in the area of thermoplastic nano-composites for FDM printing. First, the principles of AM and FDM printing are introduced. Some common thermoplastics used for FDM including acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and polylactic acid are discussed. Thermoplastic nanocomposites are classified based on the functionalities that the nanomaterials offer. The FDM printing of the nanocomposites filled with mechanically reinforcing nanofillers (nanoclay and titanium oxide), multifunctional carbon-based nanofillers (carbon nanotube, graphene, and carbon nanofiber), and bioactive nanofillers (nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite and nanocrystalline beta-tricalcium phosphate) are covered. It is shown that how thermoplastic nanocomposites are FDM printed for a variety of applications including strong and stiff parts, conductive structures, electrochemical devices, sensors, and tissue regeneration. The advantages, challenges, and promises are also discussed. It is concluded that the adaptation of nanocomposites with FDM provides a platform where the capabilities of AM and the functionalities of nanomaterials can be integrated to design and fabricate novel and efficient material systems and structures. The field is relatively new and significant research and development are expected in the future.

In this study, the influence of the surface roughness of an additive manufacturing polymer on the surface flashover voltage is investigated. We prepared two types of sample plate having the same volume resistivity and surface resistivity but different surface roughness by changing the building orientation (horizontally built and vertically built) of a 3D printer. By surface profile measurement and analysis of the arithmetic average roughness, it was revealed that the vertically built sample plate has a groove-like structure on the surface. Furthermore, it was shown that the surface flashover voltage in the direction perpendicular to the groove structure is about 20% times larger than in the parallel direction. In addition, it became clear that the relationship between the surface flashover voltage and the inter-electrode distance is well expressed in a flashover model in vacuum.

A fundamental understanding of the relationships between process parameters, microstructure and functional properties of built parts is critical for optimizing the additive manufacturing process and building parts with desired properties. This is also critical for a multi-functional part where the process needs to be optimized with respect to disparate performance requirements such as mechanical strength and thermal conductivity. This paper presents in situ high speed imaging and build-direction thermal conductivity measurements of polymer extrusion based additively manufactured parts in order to understand the effect of process parameters such as raster speed, infill percentage and layer height on build-direction thermal conductivity. Measurements of thermal conductivity using a one-dimensional heat flux method are correlated with in situ process images obtained from a high speed camera as well as cross section images of the built part. Results indicate strong dependence of build-direction thermal conductivity on raster speed, layer thickness and infill percentage, which is corroborated by high speed imaging of the printing process at different values of these process parameters. Key trade-offs between process throughput and thermal properties are also identified. In addition to enhancing our fundamental understanding of polymer extrusion based additive manufacturing and its influence on thermal properties of built parts, results presented here may facilitate process optimization towards parts with desired thermal and multi-functional properties.

The work is focussed on standardising Jaipur foot fabrication by use of additive manufacturing. The goal is to obtain a reliable, light, interchangeable and robust product which could be produced with same accuracy in any facility with right set of equipment avoiding human-induced error. The compression strength test results provided a way higher modulus for additively manufactured thermoplastic polyurethane in comparison to microcellular rubber. The microcellular rubber comprises more than 60% of the foot by volume and weight, substitution of such a material with lighter and more reliable polymer brings about not just a comparable but also a better prosthetic foot on various fronts.

The chemical ageing of polyamide 12, the most frequently used feedstock in PBF of polymers, occurs due to solid-state post-condensation during the AM process and can be reversed by appropriate processing. This paper investigates the application of acid-catalyzed hydrolytic recon-ditioning to restore virgin powder properties from used and annealed feedstock material, highlighting a pathway to more sustainability in AM. The proposed method is optimized towards PBF-printing relevant properties and mechanical characteristics of parts build with the recycled feedstock material, which are benchmarked against conventional powder refreshing strategies.

A finite element (FE) model was developed on Abaqus/Standard for 3D printing of layered polymer composite using three polymers: HDPE, PVC, and ABS. The material properties of pure polymers and their blends were measured through tensile testing of injection-molded specimens. These properties were then used as input data in the FE model for the regions of pure polymers and their interfaces. An uncoupled thermo-mechanical analysis was performed, where a heat transfer analysis was realized first using elements birth (activation/deactivation) technique and a moving cylindrical volumetric heat source as a Fortran subroutine (DFLUX). With temperature input from thermal simulation, a mechanical analysis was carried out to deform the polymer composites along and across the print direction, i.e. under isostrain and isostress conditions, respectively. It was observed that the theoretical models existing in the literature underestimate the material properties as they do not consider the residual stresses developed during fabrication. The FE simulations predicted that the estimated material properties were 10 to 50% different from those calculated by the theoretical models, depending upon the residual stress level and the print direction.

This cost is even greater in the context of large-scale additive manufacturing where the objects can be very large. As a result, a great deal of research has focused on defect identification and mitigation. To address defects during object construction, researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Manufacturing Demonstration Facility investigated an in-situ control system comprised of two sensors: a thermal camera and laser profilometer. This control system adjusted material flow and build speed to mitigate three types of defects: low layer times, underfill, and overfill. Several test objects were constructed. The control system was found to adjust build parameters to handle low layer times of approximately 15 seconds and height deviations from -100% underfill (the absence of a layer) to 50% overfill. Within two layers, height deviations could be returned to within 10% of the expected layer height. Further, preliminary results suggest the system can compensate for uneven build surfaces.

We show that dielectric anisotropy is introduced into parts fabricated using additive manufacturing techniques based on the orientation in which the part is printed. Dielectric strength testing data, based on the ASTM D149 standard, are presented for samples fabricated using the polymer jetting (PolyJet), stereolithography (SLA), fused deposition modeling (FDM), and selective laser sintering (SLS) additive manufacturing techniques. Each unique printing direction available, based on the printing method, was examined in turn. Each printing technique was found to introduce anisotropic dielectric properties within the sample coupons that were a function of the original orientation in which the part was printed, and the direction of structural susceptibility was found to be print-method dependent. Differences in dielectric strength for coupons printed in different orientations were found to exceed 70% for some combinations of printing technique and polymer. Overall, test coupons printed with stereolithography (SLA) were found to exhibit the lowest degree of dielectric strength anisotropy between print orientations. Dielectric failure mechanisms are discussed.

J	Rank, M; Heinrich, A				Rank, Manuel; Heinrich, Andreas			Image-based determination of spatial and temporal distribution of refractive index during polymer curing in additive manufacturing of optics	TM-TECHNISCHES MESSEN			German	Article						additive manufacturing; polymers; refractive index; stereolithography		In many fields and applications a spatially resolved measurement of the refractive index is desirable. This also applies to the additive manufacturing of optical components and is especially true in the special case of photopolymerization of liquid resins by UV irradiation. The key point here is that the resulting refractive index of the optical component to be printed depends on the degree of cure of the polymer. The latter is directly related to the UV irradiance used for curing. Thus, a local variation of the irradiance can enable a local variation of the refractive index of the additively manufactured optical component. In order to set a defined refractive index distribution, it is desirable to measure the refractive index during the photopolymerization of the resin in a temporally and spatially resolved manner. In this article, a method is discussed with which this can be achieved. The basic principle is that the polymer under investigation is brought into contact with a prism and, based on the principle of total reflection at the interface between prism and polymer, the refractive index of the sample can be inferred.

In this work, we deployed the 3D-print stereolithography (SLA) method to print polyurethane acrylate (PUA)-based gel polymer electrolyte (GPE). The printed PUA GPE was then characterized through several techniques, such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The printed GPE exhibited high ionic conductivity of 1.24 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at low-lithium-salt content (10 wt.%) in ambient temperature and favorable thermal stability to about 300 degrees C. The FTIR results show that addition of LiClO4 to the polymer matrix caused a shift in carbonyl, ester and amide functional groups. In addition, FTIR deconvolution peaks of LiClO4 show 10 wt.% has the highest amount of free ions, in line with the highest conductivity achieved. Finally, the PUA GPE was printed into 3D complex structure to show SLA flexibility in designing an electrolyte, which could be a potential application in advanced battery fabrication.

Embedding Carbon Dots in Superabsorbent Polymers for Additive Manufacturing	POLYMERS			English	Article						carbon dots; solvent effect; embedment; superabsorbent polymer; additive manufacturing; 3D printing	FLUORESCENCE	A type of orange carbon dots (O-CDs) synthesized via an ultrasonication route with citric acid and 1,2-phenylenediamine as precursors was embedded into sodium polyacrylate (SPA) as the ink for 3D printing. Characterizations of these spherical O-CDs revealed an ultra-small size (similar to 2 nm) and excitation-independent, but solvent dependent, emission. The O-CDs were evenly distributed with low degree of aggregation in sodium polyacrylate (SPA), which was achieved due to the property that SPA can absorb water together with O-CDs. The 3D printed photoluminescent objective with the ink revealed a great potential for high yield application of these materials for additive manufacturing. This also represents the first time, bare CDs have been reported as a photoluminescent material in 3D printing, as well as the first time SPA has been reported as a material for 3D printing.

This endows heterostructure with unique interfaces, robust architectures, and synergistic effects, making it a promising option as advanced biomaterials for the highly variable anatomy and complex functionalities of individual patients. However, the main challenges of developing heterostructure lie in the control of crystal/phase evolution and the distribution/fraction of components and structures. In recent years, additive manufacturing techniques have attracted increasing attention in developing heterostructure due to the unique flexibility in tailored structures and synthetic multimaterials. This review focuses on the additive manufacturing of heterostructure for biomedical applications. The structural features and functional mechanisms of heterostructure are summarized. The typical material systems of heterostructure, mainly including metals, polymers, ceramics, and their composites, are presented. And the resulting synergistic effects on multiple properties are also systematically discussed in terms of mechanical, biocompatible, biodegradable, antibacterial, biosensitive and magnetostrictive properties. Next, this work outlines the research progress of additive manufacturing employed in developing heterostructure from the aspects of advantages, processes, properties, and applications.

However, providing functional powder particles that unify material requirements for biodegradable and bioactive biomaterials and process requirements to enable successful powder bed fusion remains an unmet challenge. Here, a supraparticle-based approach to create biodegradable poly(lactic acid) and composite powders for the additive manufacturing of bone replacement materials is introduced. Colloidal binary Ca-SiO2 glasses and hydroxyapatite are incorporated as bioactive functional additives to support the formation of bone-like calcium phosphate. The supraparticle powders are prepared by a scalable spray-drying process, which offers control of particle size, shape, and composition. All process-relevant powder characteristics are analyzed as a function of composition and structure, including flowability, thermal, and melt rheological properties. The optimized supraparticle powders are successfully used in the process of laser powder bed fusion of polymers to prepare macroscopic specimens via additive manufacturing. It is demonstrated that the material combination of the composites provides relevant functional properties, including biodegradation and bioactivity. The process provides a flexible and adjustable toolbox for the design of functional powders toward biomedical additive manufacturing.

Compared to the conventional manufacturing process, additive manufacturing (AM) is a promising technology used for the rapid and cost-effective production of battery components containing separators. However, AM technologies like laser-based powder bed fusion of polymers (PBF-LB/P) have been neglected so far. The present research aims to fill this research gap and outline a novel approach for processing polymers like polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) into separators using PBF-LB/P. Optimal process parameters for manufacturing PVDF and PEO with PBF-LB/P to generate homogeneous and dense layers represent the key findings of this paper and provide a deeper process understanding. The first proof of concept for producing separator layers by PBF-LB/P in a scalable process is demonstrated as a result.

There is a need for a universal roughness scale that characterizes different materials used in aerodynamic research. The main purpose of this paper is identification of the potential of a material jetting AM process to produce accurate aerodynamic surfaces. A new methodology to evaluate the roughness of aerodynamic profiles (airfoils) was proposed. A very short-span wing artifact for preliminary tests and a long-span wing model were proposed for design of experiments. Different artifacts orientations were analyzed, maintaining the same surface quality on the upper and lower surface of the wing. A translucent polymeric resin was used for samples manufacturing by polymer jetting (PolyJet) technology. The effects of main factors on the surface roughness of the wing were investigated using the statistical design of experiments. Three interest locations, meaning the leading-edge, central, and trailing-edge zones, on the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil were considered. The best results were obtained for a sample oriented at XY on the build platform, in matte finish type, with a mean Ra roughness in the range of 2 to 3.5 mu m. Microscopy studies were performed to analyze and characterize the surfaces of the wing samples on their different zones.

The paste was composed of metal powder, polymer particles, and a volatile solvent. Experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of a low polymer content on the paste during processing, surface topology before and after melting, and microstructure of the single-layer samples. The results showed that polymer addition could prevent the formation of powder clots by improving homogeneity of the metal paste and suppressing defect generation. The polymer also led to a smoother surface by reducing the spatter size. Finer grains were observed in the sample produced at higher polymer content.

This study compares the rheological behavior of a high-performance thermoplastic, polyphenylsulfone (PPSU), with that of a commonly used low-temperature polymer, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), to identify suitable processing conditions for large format AM systems. The linear viscoelastic properties (complex viscosity, storage modulus, loss modulus, and tan delta) of these materials are evaluated as a function of temperature, angular frequency, and carbon fiber content. Over the range of frequencies of interest to LFAM (10-100 rad/s), ABS behaves more like an elastic solid whereas PPSU behaves more like a viscous liquid. The addition of 20-35% by weight of carbon fiber increased the shear thinning effect of both thermoplastics, showing a potential variation of 2-3x over the range of expected LFAM extrusion shear rates (10-100 s(-1)).

J	Engel, K; Kilmartin, PA; Diegel, O				Engel, Kyle; Kilmartin, Paul Andrew; Diegel, Olaf			Flexible and multi-material intrinsically conductive polymer devices fabricated via DLP and DIW additive manufacturing techniques	RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL			English	Article; Early Access						Intrinsically conducting polymer; Photopolymerisation; 3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Direct ink writing; Digital light processing	PLURONIC F127; PROPYLENE CARBONATE; LITHIUM PERCHLORATE; ETHYLENE CARBONATE; TEMPERATURE; RHEOLOGY	PurposeThe purpose of this study is to explore the synthesis of novel conductive photo-resins to produce flexible conducting composites for use in additive manufacturing. By using direct ink writing (DIW) additive manufacturing, this study aims to explore the fabrication of multimaterial devices with conductive and insulating components. Using digital light processing (DLP) additive manufacturing, this study aims to fabricate detailed objects with higher resolution than material extrusion 3D printing systems. Design/methodology/approachIn this paper, several photocurable conducting resins were prepared for DIW and DLP additive manufacturing. These resins were then cured using 405 nm near UV light to create intrinsically conductive polymer (ICP) composites. The electrochemical properties of these composites were analysed, and the effect of co-monomer choice and crosslinking density was determined. These results determined a suitable resin for subsequent additive manufacture using DIW and DLP. These 3D printing techniques were used to develop flexible conducting devices of submillimetre resolution that were fabricated with unmodified, commercially available 3D printers. FindingsCyclic voltammetry and volume conductivity analysis of the conducting resins determined the most conductive resin formula for 3D printing. Conductive devices were fabricated using the two 3D printing techniques. A multimaterial soft conducting device was fabricated using DIW, and each conducting component was insulated from its neighbours. DLP was used to fabricate a soft conducting device with good XY resolution with a minimum feature size of 0.2 mm. All devices were prepared in unmodified commercially available 3D printers. Practical implicationsThese findings have value in the development of soft robotics, artificial muscles and wearable sensors. In addition, this work highlights techniques for DIW and DLP additive manufacturing. Originality/valueSeveral original conducting resin formulae were developed for use in two 3D printing systems. The resulting 3D-printed composites are soft and flexible while maintaining their conductive properties. These findings are of value to both polymer chemists and to the field of additive manufacturing.

Currently, polymers and metals are the most commonly used materials for AM. However, ceramic materials have unique mechanical properties such as strength, corrosion resistance, and temperature resistance. This paper provides a review of recent AM techniques for ceramics such as extrusion-based AM, the mechanical properties of additively manufactured ceramics, and the applications of ceramics in various industries, including aerospace, automotive, energy, electronics, and medical. A detailed overview of binder-jetting, laser-assisted processes, laminated object manufacturing (LOM), and material extrusion-based 3D printing is presented. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in AM of ceramics are identified.

As a result of its low melting point, PCL can be processed easily by conventional polymer processing techniques. However, the additive manufacturing of PCL remains a challenge, mainly due to the fact that there are no commercially available filaments for traditional fused deposition modeling (FDM). Furthermore, when the materials are fabricated via FDM for drug delivery applications, the high temperature may deactivate the incorporated drugs/biomolecules. This study investigates the solution extrusion additive manufacturing of PCL using a lab-developed solution-type device. The device comprises a solution extrusion feeder, driving stepper motors, a power source, a syringe equipped with a dispensing tip, an accumulation platform, and a control interface. The influences of different manufacturing parameters on part quality were evaluated. The experimental results suggest that the tensile strength of the additively manufactured parts increases with fill density but decreases with the ratio of PCL to dichloromethane (DCM) and moving speed of the dispensing tip. Parts fabricated by 90 degrees print orientation of infill exhibited the greatest mechanical strength. The fabricated parts tend to heal the gaps among strips after additive manufacturing, but tiny pores can still be seen on the surfaces.

This work presents a novel additive manufacturing-based recycling approach that can be used to reclaim CFRP waste and to re-manufacture the carbon fiber into 3D printed composite parts. A trial of this idea was set up, in which carbon fiber was first reclaimed from CFRP waste using supercritical fluid and then mixed with Poly-Ether-Ether-Ketone to produce composite filaments. The filaments were then fed into a printer of fused deposition modeling (i.e., a 3D printing process) and the recycled CFRP parts were fabricated. The engineering application-oriented tests demonstrate that the reclaimed carbon fiber can modify the performances of 3D printed part effectively in terms of mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, heat conduction and wear resistance. This work illustrates that the additive manufacturing-based recycling approach offers a possible strategy to recycle CFRP waste and fabricate high-performance engineering parts with complex geometries, which are economical and environmentally friendly.

Pulsed photonic curing uses high power Xenon flash lamps to thermally fuse printed nanomaterials such as conductive metal inks. To determine the feasibility of the proposed integration, three different polymer additive manufacturing materials were exposed to typical flash curing conditions using a Novacentrix Pulseforge 3300 system. FTIR analysis revealed virtually no change in the polymer substrates, thus indicating that the curing energy did not damage the polymer. Next, copper traces were printed on the same substrate, dried, and photonically cured to establish the feasibility of thermally fusing copper metal on the polymer additive manufacturing substrates. Although drying defects were observed, electrical resistivity values ranging from 0.081 to 0.103 Omega/sq. indicated that high temperature and easily oxidized metals can be successfully printed and cured on several commonly used polymer additive manufacturing materials. These results indicate that pulsed photonic curing holds tremendous promise as an enabling technology for next generation multi-material additive manufacturing processes.

By controlling the porosity of the sintered polymeric preform we are able to control the shrinkage upon the first infiltration and pyrolysis. This enabled the manufacturing of smaller features than those achievable with other manufacturing techniques. The mechanical strength of the resulting ceramic increased with the number of reinfiltration cycles up to 24 MPa, inversely the residual porosity decreased to 10 vol%. The microstructure showed two distinct phases of SiOC and SiC. The first was attributed to the interaction between the porous polyamide and the ceramic precursor during the first infiltration. SiC derived from the pyrolysis of the preceramic precursor alone.

Additive manufacturing of woven carbon fibre polymer composites	COMPOSITE STRUCTURES			English	Article						Carbon fibre; Tailored fibre placement; Additive manufacturing; Tensile strength; Digital image correlation	CHALLENGES	A novel technique for the fabrication of woven composites using additive manufacturing (AM) is presented and evaluated. To-date fibre reinforced composites deposited by AM exhibit highly anisotropic properties as the individual layers do not interact, this study helps address this by printing of a 0/90 woven structure into one layer to aid in stress distribution. A fibre path generator was created utilising Gcode to emulate the weft-warp components of a woven construction using a continuous carbon fibre filament. This new pathing technique also allows for a woven structure to be integrated with features (such as notches) previously only possible through destructive machining processes. In order to evaluate the performance of the printed composites, open hole tensile studies were carried out in which 6 mm holes were routed into the composite structure and the resulting part's mechanical performance were compared with specimens which had been die punched as well as an unnotched control group. The latter exhibited strengths equivalent to 49% that of unnotched specimen. In contrast the specimens with woven holes exhibited strengths which were 44% higher, just 7% lower than the strength achieved for the unnotched specimens. Digital image correlation (DIC) analysis also demonstrated significantly reduced strain concentration around the printed hole perimeter, compared with that for the die punched hole.

These methods have inherent challenges such as verification of the bond quality, strength and temperature limitation of the polymer in the adhesive, interfacial adhesion strength and wetting between the metal and polymer, and a lack of load transfer via fiber reinforcement across the joint or via interlocking. This work will discuss efforts to develop an innovative solution for hybrid joining of a metal to HTPMC using state-of-the art additive manufacturing and processing techniques. Ti-6Al-4V powder is deposited using the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process onto carbon fiber fabrics, and the fabrics' bottom layer is then infused with a polymer. Ultimately, the hybrid composite consists of a fully densified metal on one face and an HTPMC on the opposing face, with a tailored transition region containing a significant amount of fiber reinforcement connecting the two faces. This hybrid material will be tested to establish its mechanical and physical properties on a small scale, and its microstructure will be characterized as the overall scope of this work. This paper is focused on the first part of the hybrid whereas the deposition of Ti-6Al-4V powder onto carbon fabrics was achieved with optimum processing parameter using SLM method.

J	Forward, C; Kim, I				Forward, Cameron; Kim, Il Yong			Layered fiber orientation optimization for continuous fiber reinforced polymer additive manufacturing using multi-material topology optimization	PROGRESS IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article; Early Access						Fiber orientation; Topology; Optimization; Layered; Additive manufacturing; Fiber reinforcement	DESIGN	With increasing demand for lightweight components in many industries, components must be optimized to save as much weight as possible. One of the main optimization tools employed by designers is topology optimization as it identifies the critical load paths within components. An even more powerful tool is multi-material topology optimization (MMTO) due to it also optimizing material selection in a component. By incorporating material selection into the optimization, new material options can be included to further improve upon the objective. The major drawback of MMTO is that the designs produced are often not manufacturable. Traditionally, these results would be interpreted by designers and modified to produce a manufacturable design. To reduce the amount of changes to the optimal design and simplify the design process, constraints can be made to tailor the optimization result to a chosen manufacturing method. This paper focuses on continuous fiber reinforced polymer additive manufacturing (CFRPAM). Being an additive manufacturing process, CFRPAM is able to realize the complex geometry often seen in topology optimization with little intervention while the continuous fiber reinforcement allows the process to produce high strength components. The research presented in this paper adapts a material model of the continuous fiber reinforced polymer and constrains the optimizer to solutions readily manufacturable with CFRPAM. The resulting methodology achieves simultaneous layered fiber orientation optimization and topology optimization. The method is shown to reduce compliance by up to 22.1% compared to the current industry standard.

Continuous Fiber Angle Topology Optimization for Polymer Composite Deposition Additive Manufacturing Applications	FIBERS			English	Article						topology optimization; additive manufacturing; short fiber polymer composites; fused filament fabrication	CODE WRITTEN; CARBON-FIBER; DESIGN; ORIENTATION; SHAPE	Mechanical properties of parts produced with polymer deposition additive manufacturing (AM) depend on the print bead direction, particularly when short carbon-fiber reinforcement is added to the polymer feedstock. This offers a unique opportunity in the design of these structures since the AM print path can potentially be defined in a direction that takes advantage of the enhanced stiffness gained in the bead and, therefore, fiber direction. This paper presents a topology optimization approach for continuous fiber angle optimization (CFAO), which computes the best layout and orientation of fiber reinforcement for AM structures. Statically loaded structures are designed for minimum compliance where the adjoint variable method is used to compute design derivatives, and a sensitivity filter is employed to reduce the checkerboard effect. The nature of the layer-by-layer approach in AM is given special consideration in the algorithm presented. Examples are provided to demonstrate the applicability of the method in both two and three dimensions. The solution to our two dimensional problem is then printed with a fused filament fabrication (FFF) desktop printer using the material distribution results and a simple infill method which approximates the optimal fiber angle results using a contour-parallel deposition strategy. Mechanical stiffness testing of the printed parts shows improved results as compared to structures designed without accounting for the direction of the composite structure. Results show that the mechanical properties of the final FFF carbon fiber/polymer composite printed parts are greatly influenced by the print direction, and optimized material orientation tends to align with the imposed force direction to minimize the compliance.

This review highlights the emerging advances in additive manufacturing-enabled hydrogels and their composites. The mechanical features of 3D printed hydrogels that show strong tissue adaptability, and the hydrogels that incorporate water within moist states, demonstrate their potential for a multitude of applications, for example, wound dressings. Recently, the 3D printing of bio-based hydrogels and other polymers has been considered a viable path toward ultimate regenerative treatment. Here, we provide an overview of (i) polymer additive manufacturing processes, (ii) different polysaccharides-based hydrogels, and (iii) the different applications of bio-based hydrogels in 3D printing.

There have been a large group of materials that can be exploited for this fashionable fabrication technique, although, polymer matrix composites are a significant class of material that have recently been used in additive manufacturing. The mixture of these polymers with nanofillers such as carbon nanotube improves mechanical, thermal, and electrical conductivity properties.

Polymer composites provide a higher strength-to-weight ratio, easily customizable product properties, flexible manufacturing processes, high resistance to corrosion or erosion, and lower cost. The recent progress in additive manufacturing (AM) methods has paved the way for even a broader range of flexibilities in design and materials in several industrial sectors, including aerospace, biomedical, construction, electronics, telecommunication, mechanical, and defense. However, some hindrances remain in the synthesis of polymer composites and their fabrication through AM technologies. A comparative review of AM processes for polymer composites and their applications is presented in this study. This study aims to provide engineers and scientists with an updated understanding of the underlying issues, barriers, limitations, and opportunities. It will also help the reader to systematically reveal the research problems and future directions related to materials synthesis and AM processes. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

The frozen-form method (FFM) (also known as low-temperature deposition manufacturing) can be used to fabricate scaffolds from biomedical polymers. These scaffolds may have both macroporous and microporous characteristics and may incorporate bioactive compounds or biomolecules during the process. In addition, scaffolds produced at low temperatures can prevent the occurrence of thermal hydrolysis, thereby improving the mechanical properties of scaffolds. In fabricating high-quality (without deformation and collapse) bioscaffolds through the FFM, the most crucial requirement is the creation of a uniform low-temperature environment. This study developed a frozen-form additive manufacturing system that includes a uniform cryogenic device to generate the uniform distribution of a low-temperature environment over a local region to produce large scaffolds that will not deform and collapse. A large square scaffold block and a high aspect ratio tubular scaffold were fabricated to verify the efficiency of this system. Furthermore, this study employed a selective compliance assembly robot arm to traverse two-dimensional deposition paths, unlike the conventional Cartesian gantry system. This study investigated the challenges stemming from the use of such a device for scaffold production and suggests methods for resolving such issues.

In general, their manufacturing process is one of the key factors affecting the life cycle of polymer composites. This article provides an overview of typical manufacturing technologies, including surface coating, additive manufacturing and magnetic pulse powder compaction, which are normally used to reduce the failure behaviour of polymer composites in service so that the quality of composite products can be improved. Advanced polymer composite powder manufacturing processes, the processing mechanism and experimental methods are described, and the influence of different manufacturing processes on the moulding quality is revealed.

It is synthesized in two steps. First, 2(6-isocyanatohexylaminocarbonylamino)-6-methyl-4[1H]-pyrimidinone (UPy-NCO) reacts with hydroxy-functionalized polybutadiene (HTPB) to obtain UPy-HTPB-UPy, and then the resulted UPy-HTPB-UPy is cross-linked under 365 nm UV light (photo-initiator: bimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone, DMPA). Further investigation reveals that the density of cross-linking and mechanical properties of the resulting polymers can be tailored via varying the amount of photo-initiator and UV exposure time. Before UV cross-linking, UPy-HTPB-UPy is found to be vitrimer-like due to the quadruple hydrogen-bonding interactions. The UPy groups at the end of the chain also enable for rapid solidification upon the evaporation of the solvent. The unsaturated double bonds in the HTPB chains enable UPy-HTPB-UPy to be UV cross-linkable in the solid state at room temperature. After cross-linking, the polymers have good shape memory effect (SME). Here, we demonstrate that this type of polymer can have many potential applications in additive manufacturing. In the cases of fused deposition modelling (FDM) and direct ink writing (DIW), not only the strength of the interlayer bonding but also the strength of the polymer itself can be enhanced via UV exposure (from thermoplastic to thermoset) either during printing or after printing. The SME after cross-linking further helps to achieve rapid volumetric additive manufacturing anytime and anywhere.

The use and application of this technique has risen dramatically over the past decade. This paper aims to first, report on the production and characterization of a shape memory polymer material filament that was manufactured to print shape memory polymer objects using material extrusion additive manufacturing. Additionally, it aims to investigate and outline the effects of major printing parameters, such as print orientation and infill percentage, on the elastic and mechanical properties of printed shape memory polymer samples. Design/methodology/approach Infill percentage was tested at three levels, 50, 75 and 100 per cent, while print orientation was tested at four different angles with respect to the longitudinal axis of the specimens at 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees. The properties examined were elastic modulus, ultimate tensile strength and maximum strain. Findings Results showed that print angle and infill percentage do have a significant impact on the manufactured test samples. Originality/value Findings can significantly influence the tailored design and manufacturing of smart structures using shape memory polymer and material extrusion additive manufacturing.

Additive manufacturing of fiber-reinforced polymer composites: A technical review and status of design methodologies	COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING			English	Review						Fiber -reinforced polymer composites; Additive manufacturing; Topology optimization; Toolpath generation; Micromechanics	TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZATION; MATRIX; STIFFNESS; MODELS	Additive manufacturing (AM) of fiber-reinforced composites is gaining traction as an important manufacturing technology to produce complex, highly customized structures. AM processes enable the fabrication of complex 3D structures with control over fiber position and orientation, offering tremendous design freedom. Although the use of AM to fabricate fiber-reinforced composites is promising, various design difficulties remain. These include consideration of structural performance subject to manufacturing constraints on fiber placement, orientation, bend radius, and other relevant limitations. Design engineers will have to consider these limitations to be able to reap the full benefits of AM to fabricate fiber-reinforced polymer composites. This paper aims to provide a survey on the advances in multi-scale topology optimization, fiber orientation parameterization, micromechanics of fiber-matrix interactions and process planning specific for the AM of complex fiber reinforced composites. The status of recent research is summarized, and future directions outlined.

Strain characteristics of additive manufactured polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) actuators	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL			English	Article						Piezoelectric; PVDF; Additive manufacturing; Actuator; Piezoelectric polymer	PIEZOELECTRIC POLYMER	Polyvinyldene fluoride (PVDF) polymer piezoelectric actuators were manufactured using an electric poling-assisted additive manufacturing (EPAM) process and tested for actuation strain in the thickness direction. A heterodyne interferometer was used to measure the strain developed by the actuators as a function of applied voltage. Results were compared to a commercially available ceramic lead-zirconium-titanate (PZT) actuator. The EPAM PVDF samples exhibit strains up to 8.78 m epsilon, compared to 1.7 m epsilon developed by PZT samples at their maximum working voltages in linear ramp testing (860 V for EPAM PVDF and 200 V for PZT). The response of the EPAM PVDF samples to an applied force was tested to measure the piezoelectric effect, although no actual piezoelectric constants are calculated with this method. Results show that strain measurements of EPAM PVDF samples were up to 5.2 times greater than comparable measurements of PZT samples. However, the degree of piezoelectricity between EPAM PVDF samples varies so quality control is required for the EPAM process to ensure sample performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most used technologies of additive manufacturing are Fused deposition modelling (FDM) which use plastic wires for deposition of parts layers. There are also others technologies which use for example resins, paper, plastic powder but also steel and producing of parts from metal powder. Also in plastic materials is wide range of polymers which are suitable for FDM technology. Conventional materials are ABS, PLA, Nylon, PETG and others polymers. There are also special composites where the base is conventional polymer and particles of other solid material as glass, metal, wood which give to produced parts specific properties or appearance. Very specific material is conductive material which can conduct the electrical current. Presented paper deals with using of conductive PLA filaments for part producing. There are described results from scientific experiments which are prepared by standard methods and evaluated by statistical methods. Measured are material properties and electrical resistance.

Fabrication of continuous carbon, glass and Kevlar fibre reinforced polymer composites using additive manufacturing	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Carbon fibre; Glass fibre; Kevlar fibre; Additive manufacturing; Continuous fibres		This study evaluates the performance of continuous carbon, Kevlar and glass fibre reinforced composites manufactured using the fused deposition modelling (FDM) additive manufacturing technique. The fibre reinforced nylon composites were fabricated using a Markforged Mark One 3D printing system. The mechanical performance of the composites was evaluated both in tension and flexure. The influence of fibre orientation, fibre type and volume fraction on mechanical properties were also investigated. The results were compared with that of both non-reinforced nylon control specimens, and known material property values from literature. It was demonstrated that of the fibres investigated, those fabricated using carbon fibre yielded the largest increase in mechanical strength per fibre volume. Its tensile strength values were up to 6.3 times higher than those obtained with the non-reinforced nylon polymer. As the carbon and glass fibre volume fraction increased so too did the level of air inclusion in the composite matrix, which impacted on mechanical performance. As a result, a maximum efficiency in tensile strength was observed in glass specimen as fibre content approached 22.5%, with higher fibre contents (up to 33%), yielding only minor increases in strength.

J	Chatham, CA; Long, TE; Williams, CB				Chatham, Camden A.; Long, Timothy E.; Williams, Christopher B.			A review of the process physics and material screening methods for polymer powder bed fusion additive manufacturing	PROGRESS IN POLYMER SCIENCE			English	Review						Powder bed fusion; Selective laser sintering; Polymer additive manufacturing; Process parameter selection	LASER SINTERING SLS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; ENERGY DENSITY; BUILD PARAMETERS; PARTICLE-SIZE; HEAT-TRANSFER; POLYAMIDE; PARTS; TEMPERATURE; BEHAVIOR	Powder bed fusion (PBF) is one of seven different classes of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies identified by ASTM and ISO. In polymer PBF, an infra-red energy source selectively fuses powder particles layer-by-layer into a three-dimensional structure. This enables the production of parts without the use of a mold, which is useful for prototyping and low-volume production. The early research in polymer PBF has focused largely on exploring the expanded design space afforded by the technology and modeling the heat transfer during fabrication. These are aspects that emphasize the manufacturing process and resultant quality in a material agnostic manner. Early investigations into structure-process-property relationships focused on the industrially dominant polyamide family. Only recently has research been conducted towards expanding the PBF material portfolio beyond nylon-12 and its composites. Guiding this research is the knowledge gained from studying the behavior of polyamides in PBF, which resulted in pervasive guidelines for material screening and process parameter development in polymer PBF, including the concepts of a "stable sintering region" and utilizing the "energy melt ratio" to set machine parameters. However, these guidelines are largely empirical and disproportionately focus on process parameter effects on the mechanical properties of the printed parts, instead of the intrinsic polymer properties and first principles of polymer science and engineering. This review categorically compiles the PBF AM literature by the three process sub-functions: powder recoating, energy input, and coalescence and cooling. The literature outlining the governing physics, structure-property-processing relationships enabling printing, and the process-structure-property relationships enabling targeted final part properties are discussed within each sub-function. Establishing these polymer-manufacturing relationships, both for printability and for final part property prediction, is important to aid in the identification and adaptation of existing polymers, and development of novel polymers, for PBF AM.

However, design a biodegradable structure for an intended period of support is rather difficult. Nowadays in the stent industry the manufacture process par excellence is the laser micro cutting. Nevertheless in the case of polymeric stents, the 3D additive manufacturing techniques could be a more economical solution. This work aim to design and implement a novel 3D Additive Manufacturing Machine to Biodegradable Stent Manufacture. The effects of nozzle temperature, fluid flow, and printing speed over the polycaprolactone stent's precision is studied. Results have shown the strong influence of temperature and flow rate over the printing precision. Printing speed did not had a clear tendency. The results allow us to believe that the novel technology presented in this paper will be an interesting future research line. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Several conventional techniques have been used to create polymer-based structures. Polymer matrix composites (PMCs) have recently been considered in additive manufacturing (AM). Also, the most remarkable progress in this field has been made in short fiber-reinforced composites, whereas continuous fiber fabricating residues is a very new area of study. Fused deposition modeling (FDM), fused filament fabrication (FFF), direct ink writing (DIW), and stereolithography (SLA) are examples of AM techniques that offer significant advantages over traditional techniques by enabling the creation of intricate PMC material sample geometries without the need for a mold. External forces such as outward, magnetic, electric, ultrasonic, or shear forces facilitate the convergence of AM processes with filler material arrangement methods. This convergence enables the precise geometric arrangement and positioning of continuous or intermittent fillers. Despite challenges in PMCs and process expansion, fresh design, modeling, and analysis techniques are desirable; These newly developed composite building types can effectively determine their best offers. The current review presents an overview of experiments and developments associated with AM of PMC materials from 2018 until now and provides a detailed discussion of current findings, challenges, and gaps.

The PLA component under study was selected from the production line of a brewing company, and it was redesigned and analyzed using the Finite Element Method, 3D printed, and installed under real service. The results obtained indicated that, even though the durability of the 3D printed part was lower than the original, savings of about EUR 7000 a year could be achieved for the component studied. Moreover, it was shown that widespread use of AM with other specific PLA components could result in even more significant savings. Additionally, a metallic hanger (2700 kg/m(3)) from the cockpit of an airplane ATR 70 series 500 was successfully redesigned and additively manufactured in Nylon 645, resulting in a mass reduction of approximately 60% while maintaining its fit-for-purpose. Therefore, the components produced by FDM were used as fully functional components rather than prototype models, which is frequently stated as a major constraint of the FDM process.

The results of fatigue tests for this material present in the literature are limited, especially for additive manufactured elements. The specimens were manufactured using the injection molding and the fused filament fabrication (FFF) method. The FFF specimens were divided into five subgroups, depending on the direction of filament deposition and infill density. The achieved results are aimed to verify the selected experimental method of fatigue testing of materials used in the additive manufacturing technology. It was considered an important issue, since there is no standard practice for fatigue testing of FFF- manufactured polymers, and research reported in the literature is usually obtained for a small number of specimens. In this work, over 20 specimens per S-N curve were used, which enables to classify them as reliability data type according to ASTM E 739 standard. It has been shown that the resultant fatigue lives can be related with applied nominal stress amplitudes using the classical S-N curve, described with Basquin-type power law function. This is evidenced, among the others, by the very similar scatter of results for both manufacturing technologies and the similar slopes of S-N curves. Some similar conclusions are hard to find in other works. The achieved results can also provide knowledge regarding the differences of monotonic and fatigue behavior of PLA, which is a commonly used biodegradable polymer, with respect to the technology of specimen's manufacturing method. They can be useful in the development of biodegradable implants and other devices used in tissue or biomedical engineering. It has been shown that, to some extent, the fatigue testing of FFF-manufactured parts can be performed in the similar way as parts manufactured by injection molding.

Compared to conventional AM technologies, FRAM offered complementary solutions to their needs. In general, fibers have been traditionally used in many manufacturing processes for various reasons. However, using conventional methods, there are obstacles in obtaining the desired complex geometries and low setup costs. AM offers possible avoidance of these limitations. Shape complexity, infill density, and manufacturing lead times are no longer barriers. Bridging AM with fiber reinforced materials offers a vast opportunity for lightweight and strong parts. Depending on the affinity, fibers with different structures can be mixed with different matrix materials and, thus, create stronger parts with improved mechanical properties. Process parameters like raster angle, infill speed, layer thickness, and nozzle temperature also strongly impact physical properties of FRAM products and are considered carefully. FRAM-based components are used in many industries such as aerospace, motorsports, and biomedicine, where the weight, strength, and complexity of parts are critical. Hence, numerous industrial companies and research facilities are investigating the implementation and adaptation of FRAM to their requirements. Studies are generally conducted on new materials, new FRAM technologies, the effect of fiber orientations and fraction on the performance of parts, improving the printing parameters, and other subjects. This study reports the current trends and challenges that FRAM is bringing to AM ecosystem.

J	Chatham, CA; Ii, ALW				Chatham, Camden A.; Ii, Aaron L. Washington			A framework for forming thermoset polymer networks during laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Laser powder bed fusion; Selective laser sintering; Thermosetting polymers; Covalent network	SINTERING PROCESS; BEHAVIOR; RHEOLOGY; REGION	It is commonly reported that the limited availability of material types is a major barrier to widespread adoption for polymer laser powder bed fusion (PBF/L) additive manufacturing (AM). A deeper understanding of the physico-chemical relationships between AM process stimuli and polymer responsive behavior is needed to make data-driven decisions for PBF/L specific material development and formulation. Many researchers have cumulatively built the current state of PBF/L "science-based manufacturing"framework where an initial guess for process parameter values can be determined from measured polymer properties and the first-principles of physics. However, published literature has focused on developing this framework for thermoplastic processing of polymers omitting many specific concerns unique to processing thermosetting materials. The authors consider in the present work the implications of many specific aspects unique to thermosetting polymers during PBF/L manufacturing. These aspects are contextually discussed according to the five sub-functions of PBF/L and are described mathematically where appropriate alongside example data from thermosetting materials commercially available in powder form. This expansion of the prevailing material development framework to include thermosetting polymers paves the way for the unique performance properties offered by that class to be manifest through AM's geometric freedom.

However, existing additive manufacturing (AM) approaches can only treat one material species at a time due to their intrinsic working mechanisms. Here we develop an AM manipulator for manufacturing a wide variety of material species, including polymers, ceramics, and metals, through a multifilament transport strategy assisted by laser power. The six-jaw manipulator contains three pairs of filament delivering/cutting systems for transporting diverse materials and a beam of tunable laser as the thermal source. The whole apparatus is integrated into a robotic manipulator to create a multifreedom manufacturing platform. With this innovation, products with multiple material species and desired complex geometries can be fabricated on demand. Furthermore, we synthesize a multimaterial (polymer/ceramic/metal) printed magnetoelectric pressure sensor that can convert applied mechanical forces to electricity and maintain efficiency even after undergoing 10000 cycles of pressure/recovery. With this multimaterial filament transport and laser manufacturing strategy, our AM manipulator exhibits promising application in the advanced manufacturing of embedded electronics, sensors, soft robotics, and customizable medical devices.

One specific mechanical property, folding endurance, requires both low flexural strength and simultaneously high elongation to achieve the flexibility needed to sustain repetitive bending. The present work provides an analysis of selected thermoplastics' flexural capacity, including nylon (PA), polyethylene terephthalate (PETG), polylactide (PLA), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), and a TPR blend (ABSMG94: SEBS-g-MA 25:75), in order to evaluate the maximum number of folding cycles and load capacity sustained by a living hinge. A fractographic analysis was performed using scanning electron microscopy and computed tomography. Similar to the performance of injected molded products, the experimental results demonstrated that three of the tested materials behaved well in the context of a large number of folding cycles prior to an eventual detachment into two pieces; TPR blend, 244,424 cycles; PP endured one million cycles; and TPU, more than two million cycles, while the remaining materials failed to survive more than 1000 cycles. The hinges failure analysis revealed a wide variety of fracture morphologies and failure modes. In regard to the load capacity, PLA, PETG, and nylon provided the highest results in the ultimate strength of an axial static force applied (790.61 N, 656.06 N, and 652.75 N respectively), while the TPR blend was the highest (398.44 N) of the elastomeric materials (PP, TPU, and TPR blend). The evaluated materials demonstrated enough flexibility for use in specific applications such as stretchable electronics and wearable applications.

The majority of the polymers used with EBAM show moisture sensitivity. However, moisture effects become more pronounced in polymers used for critical applications, such as biomedical stents, sensors, and actuators. The effects of moisture on the manufacturing process and the long-term performance of Shape Memory Polyurethane (SMPU) have not been fully investigated in the literature. This study focuses primarily on block-copolymer SMPUs that have two different hard/soft (h/s) segment ratios. It investigates the effect of moisture on the various properties via studying: (i) the effect of moisture trapping within these polymers and the consequences when manufacturing; (ii) and the effect on end product performance of plasticization by moisture. Results indicate that higher h/s SMPU shows higher microphase separation, which leads to an increase of moisture trapping within the polymer. Understanding moisture trapping is critical for EBAM parts due to an increase in void content and a decrease in printing quality.

Planar deposition flow modeling of fiber filled composites in large area additive manufacturing	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Large area additive manufacturing; Fiber orientation; Polymer composite; Elastic properties; Thermal properties	EXTRUDATE SWELL; CARBON-FIBER; POLYMER COMPOSITES; ELASTIC PROPERTIES; ORIENTATION; BEHAVIOR; GEOMETRY; TENSORS	The rapid transition of the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) Additive Manufacturing (AM) process from small scale prototype models to large scale polymer deposition has been driven, in part, by the addition of short carbon fibers to the polymer feedstock. The addition of short carbon fibers improves both the mechanical and thermal properties of the printed beads. The improvements to the anisotropic mechanical and thermal properties of the polymer feedstock are dependent on the spatially varying orientation of short carbon fibers which is itself a function of the velocity gradients in the flow field throughout the nozzle and in the extrudate during deposition flow. This paper presents a computational approach for simulating the deposition flow that occurs in the Large Area Additive Manufacturing (LAAM) process and the effects on the final short fiber orientation state in the deposited polymer bead and the resulting bead mechanical and thermal properties. The finite element method is used to evaluate Stokes flow for a two-dimensional planar flow field within a Strangpresse Model 19 LAAM polymer deposition nozzle. A shape optimization method is employed to compute the shape of the polymer melt flow free surface below the nozzle exit as the bead is deposited on a moving print platform. Three nozzle configurations are considered in this study. Fiber orientation tensors are calculated throughout the fluid domain using the Folgar-Tucker fiber interaction model. The effective bulk mechanical properties, specifically the longitudinal and transverse moduli, and the coefficient of thermal expansion, are also calculated for the deposited bead based on the spatially varying fiber orientation tensors. Fiber orientation is found to be highly aligned along the deposition direction of the resulting bead and the computed properties through the thickness of the bead are found to be affected by nozzle height during deposition.

Damage in extrusion additive manufactured biomedical polymer: Effects of testing direction and environment during cyclic loading	JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Polylactide; Damage; Interface; Submerged	POLYLACTIC ACID PLA; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; FATIGUE BEHAVIOR; BOND STRENGTH; FRACTURE	Although biodegradable polymers were widely researched, this is the first study considering the effect of combined testing environments and cyclic loading on the most important aspect related to additive manufacturing: the interfacial bond between deposited layers. Its results give confidence in applicability of the material extrusion additive manufacturing technology for biomedical fields, by demonstrating that the interface behaves in a manner similar to that of the bulk-polymer material. To do this, especially designed tensile specimens were used to analyse the degradation of 3D-printed polymers subjected to constant-amplitude and incremental cyclic loads when tested in air at room temperature (control) and submerged at 37 ?C (close to in-vivo conditions). The mechanical properties of the interface between extruded filaments were compared against the bulk material, i.e. along filaments. In both cases, cyclic loading caused only a negligible detrimental effect compared to non-cyclic loading (less than 10 % difference in ultimate tensile strength), demonstrating the suitability of using 3D-printed components in biomedical applications, usually exposed to cyclic loading. For cyclic tests with a constant loading amplitude, larger residual deformation (>100 % greater) and energy dissipation (>15 % greater) were found when testing submerged in solution at 37 ?C as opposed to in laboratory conditions (air at room temperature), as used by many studies. This difference may be due to plasticisation effects of water and temperature. For cyclic tests with incrementally increasing loading amplitudes, the vast majority of energy dissipation happened in the last two cycles prior to failure, when the polymer approached the yield point. The results demonstrate the importance of using an appropriate methodology for biomedical applications; otherwise, mechanical properties may be overestimated.

In addition, polymer-based drug delivery systems can improve drug safety, efficacy, patient compliance, and are the key materials in AM. Therefore, combining AM and polymers can be beneficial to overcome the existing limitations in the development of controlled release drug delivery systems. Considering these advantages, here we are focusing on the recent developments in the field of polymeric drug delivery systems prepared by AM. This review provides a comprehensive overview on a holistic polymer-AM perspective for drug delivery systems with discussion on the materials, properties, design and fabrication techniques and the mechanisms used to achieve a controlled release system. The current challenges and future perspectives for personalized medicine and clinical use of these systems are also briefly discussed. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It enables you to simulate things more effectively. So far, experiments with polymer-based lubrication have been done on atomically smooth surfaces, under dynamic conditions, and on the nano- or micro-scale. Polymer-based lubrication in 3D printing has been studied in depth, which has made it possible to make significant, multifunctional 3D structures with microscale accuracy. It is a crucial way to approach lubrication and has sparked much scientific interest. A thorough literature review is done to keep track of the latest advances in 3D printing for structural polymer-based lubrication simulation. The design and lubrication performance quality of bio-inspired, different-sized simulation structures is given much attention. The material requirements, skills, and representative applications of various 3D printing technologies are summarized. The efficient directions for future research in designing and making 3D-printed lubrication structures are also pointed out.

Effects of the joint interface area (hole diameter of 5-13 mm) and preheating of the substrates (room temperature, 50 and 90 degrees C) were investigated on the mechanical properties of the joints. Peak load in the tensile-shear and cross-tension tests increased with enhancement of the joint interface area (up to (similar to)280 N and (similar to)160 N, respectively). Higher joint strength in the tensile-shear test compared to the cross-tension test was discussed at the light of the failure locations in the tests. Preheating of the substrates increased the joint strength via improvement in the bonds between the polymer sheet and the additive part and increase in the adhesion force between the printed layers.

An underexplored aspect of this technique is concerned with the formation of interfaces between successively deposited layers. This is particularly important for large-scale additive manufacturing of semi-crystalline polymers because of the highly non-isothermal conditions involved, which influence both nucleation and crystal growth. The objective of this work is to investigate the microstructure and the corresponding viscoelastic properties of carbon fiber (CF) reinforced polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) resulting from extrusion-based high-throughput AM process. Questions on development of morphology focus on polymer crystal structure and carbon fiber orientation in the vicinity of the interface between successive layers. This study attempts to establish a fundamental understanding of the role of the AM has in transferring a set of intrinsic material properties to the macroscopic properties of the final AM structure.

By using polymers, powders and preceramic formulated materials, AM techniques are pushing towards higher resolution, lower shrinkage and shorter building time. Herein, we present the fabrication of ceramic microstructures (< 200 x 200 x 200 mu m(3)) with sub-micrometer resolution based on two-photon polymerization (TPP). 3D structuring of a preceramic resin by photopolymerization produces a so-called green body. The final ceramic part is obtained after pyrolysis of the green body. The high-resolution 3D shaped structures that we demonstrated could be employed as tools or components for microdevices. We report a lower linear shrinkage of 30% of TPP green bodies from a polysiloxane precursor with low porosity, no cracks and no significant shape distortion after pyrolysis, which implies the potential for highly controllable manufacturing of micro-ceramic parts based on commercially available chemical compounds. The protocol for preparing, fabricating and developing the resin is detailed.

J	Engel, K; Kilmartin, PA; Diegel, O				Engel, Kyle; Kilmartin, Paul Andrew; Diegel, Olaf			Additive manufacture of ionic polymer-metal composite actuators using digital light processing techniques	RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL			English	Article						Electroactive polymer; Ionic polymer-metal composites; Additive manufacturing; 3D printing; Digital light processing; Ion exchange; Electro-actuation	COPOLYMERS; MEMBRANES	Purpose The purpose of this study is to develop a additive manufacturing (AM) process for the fabrication of ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) devices with complex designs that would be time-consuming to replicate using conventional manual methods. These IPMC devices have considerable potential in electroactive polymers (EAPs) and soft actuators. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a novel three-dimensional (3D) AM technique to develop IPMCs. Digital light processing (DLP) fabrication of soft EAPs was undertaken using a vat-based AM method, followed by deposition of cost-effective outer silver electrodes. Findings DLP-fabricated devices were compared to conventional Nafion (TM)-117 devices. DLP layer-by-layer fabrication of these devices allowed for good resolution for a range of printed objects. Electrical actuation of the DLP-produced IPMCs showed tip displacements of up to 3 mm, and greater actuation was seen in the presence of lithium rather than magnesium cations. The IMPCs showed good ion exchange capacities, while electrochemical analysis showed the reversible formation and removal of AgCl layers in addition to ion movement. Practical implications The AM of these devices allows for rapid prototyping as well as potential use in the development of multiple degrees of freedom actuators and devices. Originality/value An original resin formulation was developed for DLP 3D printing. This formula is chemically distinct from the conventional Nafion (TM)-117 membranes that can be purchased. Additionally, this method allows for the manufacture of complex objects that would be difficult to machine by hand. These findings are of value to both the fields of polymer chemistry and AM.

Over the last few years, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has been focusing on large-scale printing of single material systems, typically un-reinforced or short fiber reinforced polymers, in order to address needs in stiffness-limited applications. This paper describes the development of a multi-material large-scale AM system through a collaboration with Cincinnati Inc. and Performance Feed Screw Inc. Modifications to the Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAAM) system includes a new extruder design to accommodate a dual feed system, an expanded two-dryer system with a capacity of 273 kg/dryer, and a system that is capable of mixing pelletized materials up to 60Kg/hr. This article highlights the advantages and limitations of the multi-material system as well as potential applications.

We investigated the cumulative effects of layering a conductive polymer composite 2 wt% MWCNT filler in PEDOT:PSS on a Mylar substrate for application to electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding. The optical transmittace of spin coated composite layers is 90%, 45%, and 20% with a thickness of 0.05 mu m, 0.15 mu m, and 0.45 mu m respectively. Drop cast composite layers have 0% transmittance due to their much greater starting thickness of 4.4 mu m. The addition of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) to the solution mixture and substrate heating to 40 degrees C improves the conductivity, and drying time of the cured composite layers to 10 min. This study shows that the cumulative effects of composite layering are additive, but the electrical properties do not scale the same way. A significant increase in the EMI SE is mainly attributed to the enhanced electrical conductivity of the composite. The insertion of a 50 mu m gap in between two 15 mu m composite layers accentuates the EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) significantly to a peak of 21 dB within a narrow frequency range in the Ku-band tested.

This has caused injection molding to be limited to large-volume production, as the tooling needs to amortize over large volumes to achieve a low unit cost. Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies enables a high degree of complexity at a low cost, which enables cost-efficient manufacturing of the geometries required for injection molding tooling. Using AM tooling for thermoplastics injection molding presents a challenge, as it requires high pressures and temperatures, which destroy the tooling after only a few shots. Hence, this study focuses on investigating the use of softer polymer tooling with Reaction Injection Molding (RIM), which requires lower temperatures and pressures than those of thermoplastics injection molding. A case study has been performed to assess both the cost implications and how the use of AM tooling for RIM affects organizational agility.

The 3D printed magnetic field-responsive smart polymer composite creates a wide range of motions, opening up possibilities for various new applications, like sensing and actuation in soft robotics, biomedical devices, and autonomous systems. In M-PSL process, a certain amount of nano- or micro-scale ferromagnetic particles is deposited into resin vat with a programmable micro deposition nozzle. Then a magnetic field is applied to direct the magnetic particles to the desired area. After that, digital mask images are used to cure particles in photopolymer with certain patterns. Important issues like magnetic particle movements, curing mechanisms, and manufacturing process planning are discussed. Two test cases, an impeller and a two-wheel roller, have been successfully fabricated for remote control under external magnetic field, showing the capability of printed smart polymer composites on performing desired functions.

This technology, called material coextrusion, generates an expanded range of material properties, which can gradually change in the design domain, ensuring blending or higher bonding/interlocking among the different materials. To exploit the opportunities offered by these technologies, it is necessary to know the behavior of the combined materials according to the materials fractions. In this work, two compatible pairs of materials, namely Polylactic Acid (PLA)-Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) and Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate (ASA)-TPU, were investigated by changing the material fractions in the coextrusion process. An original model describing the distribution of the materials is proposed. Based on this, the mechanical properties were investigated by analytical and numerical approaches. The analytical model was developed on the simplified assumption that the coextruded materials are a set of rods, whereas the more realistic numerical model is based on homogenization theory, adopting the finite element analysis of a representative volume element. To verify the deposition model, a specific experimental test was developed, and the modeled material deposition was superimposed and qualitatively compared with the actual microscope images regarding the different deposition directions and material fractions. The analytical and numerical models show similar trends, and it can be assumed that the finite element model has a more realistic behavior due to the higher accuracy of the model description. The elastic moduli obtained by the models was verified in experimental tensile tests. The tensile tests show Young's moduli of 3425 MPa for PLA, 1812 MPa for ASA, and 162 MPa for TPU. At the intermediate material fraction, the Young's modulus shows an almost linear trend between PLA and TPU and between ASA and TPU. The ultimate tensile strength values are 63.9 MPa for PLA, 35.7 MPa for ASA, and 63.5 MPa for TPU, whereas at the intermediate material fraction, they assume lower values. In this initial work, the results show a good agreement between models and experiments, providing useful tools for designers and contributing to a new branch in additive manufacturing research.

Byron			Temperature-Dependent Mechanical Properties of Additive Manufactured Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polyethersulfone	APPLIED COMPOSITE MATERIALS			English	Article						Material extrusion additive manufacturing; Polymer-matrix composites (PMCs); Mechanical characterization; Elevated temperature	TENSILE BEHAVIOR; STRAIN-RATE; COMPOSITES	Material extrusion additive manufacturing of thermoplastic composites have been used for rapid prototyping of tools or molds that are then used for production of structural composite parts via conventional manufacturing methods. The process utilizes short fiber reinforced polymer pellets, which allows for the printed mold to remain rigid throughout the final composite part fabrication process as well as retain some integrity. Composite parts manufactured using printed molds are usually accomplished at elevated temperatures, and high-temperature composite feedstock that are commercially available has enabled this type of application. However, mechanical data of printed parts is often limited to certain deformation modes and elevated temperature behavior is usually not reported in the literature. This work characterizes and discusses the mechanical behavior of a short fiber reinforced polyethersulfone and includes the influence of elevated temperature. Tension, compression, and shear deformations were analyzed using digital image correlation, which captured the surface strain fields for each temperature condition. The results show that stiffness generally decreases with temperature; however, certain shear deformation modes do not necessarily follow this trend. Moreover, specimens loaded under tension exhibit brittle-like behavior at elevated temperatures. These results are useful for designing printed composites using material extrusion additive manufacturing to account for changes in behavior under elevated temperature environments.

In the past few decades, several design guidelines have been proposed for creating porous lattice structures, particularly for biomedical applications. Meanwhile, the capabilities of AM to fabricate a wide range of biomaterials, including metals and their alloys, polymers, and ceramics, have been exploited, offering unprecedented benefits to medical professionals and patients alike. In this review article, we provide an overview of the design principles that have been developed and used for the AM of biomaterials as well as those dealing with three major categories of biomaterials, i.e., metals (and their alloys), polymers, and ceramics. The design strategies can be categorised as: library-based design, topology optimisation, bio-inspired design, and meta-biomaterials. Recent developments related to the biomedical applications and fabrication methods of AM aimed at enhancing the quality of final 3D-printed biomaterials and improving their physical, mechanical, and biological characteristics are also highlighted. Finally, examples of 3D-printed biomaterials with tuned properties and functionalities are presented.

Usually, EAM is performed with filament feedstock, but using pellets instead of filaments yields many benefits, including significantly lower cost and a wider choice of materials. High-performance polymers offer high strength even when produced with AM technique, allowing to produce near-net-shape functional parts. The production of these materials in filament form is still limited and expensive; therefore, in this paper, the possibility of producing AM components with engineering polymers from pellets will be thoroughly investigated. In this work, the effectiveness of a specially designed AM machine for printing high-performance materials in pellet form was tested. The material chosen for the investigation is PEI 1000 which offers outstanding mechanical and thermal properties, giving the possibility to produce with EAM functional components. Sensitivity analyses have been carried out to define a process window in terms of thermal process parameters by observing different response variables. Using the process parameters in the specified range, the additive manufactured material has been mechanically tested, and its microstructure has been investigated, both in dried and undried conditions. Finally, a rapid tool for sheet metal forming has been produced.

Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is the technique that has become the most renowned AM process due to its simplicity and because it is the cheapest method. The main objective of this research is to perform a numerical simulation of the thermo-mechanical behaviour of AM polymer with continuous carbon fibre reinforcement exposed to elevated temperatures. The influence of global thermal loads on AM material was focused on mechanical property changes at the microscale (level of fiber-matrix interaction). The mechanical response (strain/stress distribution) of the AM material on the temperature loading was modelled using the finite element method (FEM). The coupled thermal-displacement analysis was used during the numerical calculations. The strain in the sample due to its exposition on elevated temperature was measured using fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. The numerical results were compared with the experimental results achieved for the sample exposure to the same thermal conditions showing good agreement. A strong influence of the temperature on the matrix structure and the condition of bondings between fibres and matrix was observed.

Analysis of General and Specific Standardization Developments in Additive Manufacturing From a Materials and Technological Approach	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Standardization; additive manufacturing; ASTM; ISO	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; PROCESS PARAMETERS; TENSILE-STRENGTH; PLA; ADVANTAGES; BEHAVIOR; FAILURE; DESIGN; METAL; PARTS	Additive manufacturing processes and products are very present in the current productive landscape, and in fact these technologies have been one of the most intensively studied and improved during the last years; however, there is still no defined and homogeneous regulatory context for this field. In this work, a thorough review of the main general and specific regulatory developments in design, materials and processes standards for additive manufacturing has been carried out, with special attention to the standards for mechanical characterization of polymer-based products. In many cases standards developed for other productive contexts are identified as recommended references, and some contradictory trends can be identified when different documents and previous experiences are consulted. Thus, as it is logical considering that all these technologies are involved in an intensive and continuous evolution process, there is a certain lack of clarity regarding the standards to be considered. This work aims to contribute to clarify the current standardization context in additive manufacturing and provide some guidelines for the identification of appropriate standards. The paper also emphasizes that the key for next regulatory developments in mechanical testing is to develop standards that consider particular AM processes along with materials. Moreover, a great gap between available standard about additive technologies based on metallic materials and polymer materials during the last years has been detected. Finally, the provided overview is considered of interest as support for research and practice in additive manufacturing, and both in intensive productive scenarios and for particular users and makers.

Using these techniques, spatial variations of cells along multiple axes with high geometric complexity in combination with different biomaterials can be generated. The level of control offered by these computer-controlled technologies to design and fabricate tissues will accelerate our understanding of the governing factors of tissue formation and function. Moreover, it will provide a valuable tool to study the effect of anatomy on graft performance. In this review, we discuss the rationale for engineering tissues and organs by combining computer-aided design with additive manufacturing technologies that encompass the simultaneous deposition of cells and materials. Current strategies are presented, particularly with respect to limitations due to the lack of suitable polymers, and requirements to move the current concepts to practical application.

To investigate the wear resistance of polymers for injection molding, subtractive and additive manufacturing of occlusal devices in comparison with enamel antagonist wear and material properties (i.e., hardness, flexural strength, and flexural modulus). Methods. Injection molding was compared with milling and the additive technologies stereolithography, low force stereolithography, and digital light processing. For each material, eight specimens were produced for wear measurements. Extracted human premolars served as indenters. All samples were subjected to two series of a 2-body wear test consisting of 200,000 circular loading cycles with an applied load of 1) 20 N and 2) 50 N in a thermocy-cling environment (5/55 degrees C, 30 s, 3860 cycles, H2O). Wear resistance was characterized by means of maximum depth and volume of the resulting traces. In addition, enamel wear of the indenters and Vickers hardness, flexural strength, and flexural modulus of the polymers were determined. Wear was statistically analyzed with linear general models for repeated measures and material properties with one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey-HSD tests. Results. Wear of the antagonists was not influenced by the material (P >= 0.343). Likewise, no differences in wear resistance were found between materials after cyclic loading with 20 N or 50 N (P >= 0.074). Material properties investigated revealed decreased values for the resins for the additive manufacturing with the exception of flexural strength of one material. Significance. Within the limitations of this in-vitro study, arylates for conventional, subtractive, and additive manufacturing of occlusal devices differ in material properties but not in wear resistance and antagonist wear.

To understand the basic mechanical behaviour, simple tension tests have been conducted on ASTM-D638 specimens of carbon fiber and natural fiber reinforced polymer matrix composites made by AM in different modes as well as directly in filament form using a filament extruder. The tensile strengths reveal that the internal defects unique to additive manufacturing, such as lack of fusion (LOF) sites and voids, play crucial role in the macroscopic fracture. Based on the tensile test results, finite element analysis of shell structures typical of below-knee prosthetic sockets has been conducted to preSelection and peer-review under responsibility of the scientific committee of the 2nd International Conference on Recent Advances in Materials & Manufacturing Technologies.dict the fracture initiation sites and propagation paths.

Two typical forms of powder paving, counter-rolling and scraping, are performed with mixed carbon fibers/polyamide12 powders. It is found that the compaction of the mixed powders in the counter-rolling form powder paving is stronger than that in the scraping form. With the same paving speed and layer thickness, the powder layer obtained from the counter-rolling form powder paving is denser. For both forms of powder paving, the powder layer density decreases with the increasing of the paving speed. Finally, the increase of the fiber length will reduce the spreadability of the mixed powders, and hence decreases the packing density of the powder layer. The negative effect of the fiber length is relatively weak in the counter-rolling form powder paving due to the compaction of the roller.

The influence of modified fillers such as alumina modified silica, quaternary ammonium bentonite, lignin/silicon dioxide hybrid filler and unmodified multiwalled carbon nanotubes on the properties of polycarbonate (PC) composites was investigated. In the first part of the work, the polymer and its composites containing 0.5-3 wt.% filler were used to obtain a filament using the proprietary technological line. The moldings for testing functional properties were obtained with the use of 3D printing and injection molding techniques. In the next part of the work, the rheological properties-mass flow rate (MFR) and mechanical properties-Rockwell hardness, Charpy impact strength and static tensile strength with Young's modulus were examined. The structure of the obtained composites was also described and determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The porosity, roughness and dimensional stability of samples obtained by 3D printing were also determined. On the other hand, the physicochemical properties were presented on the basis of the research results using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide angle X-ray scattering analysis (WAXS) and Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Additionally, the electrical conductivity of the obtained composites was investigated. On the basis of the obtained results, it was found that both the amount and the type of filler significantly affected the functional properties of the composites tested in the study.

Due to its energy-efficiency and rapid curing of thermosets, a series of applications related to polymer and polymer composite manufacturing have been developed based on FP, in particular additive manufacturing (AM). While the current research demonstrates successful printing of 1D, 2D and 3D structures based on FP, a key challenge is the determination of the printing parameters through trial-and-error, which hinders its large-scale application. To better understand how different process parameters affect the front behavior and the printing process, and eventually enable fast printing of complex parts without trial-and-error, computational modeling of the printing process is highly desired. For the first time, we develop a mul-tiphysics finite element model for simulating FP-assisted AM which accounts for both the thermal-chemical process and the ink deposition in a real printing process. To simulate the dynamic ink deposition process, element activation is used that constantly adds elements to the simulation domain following a predefined printing path and velocity. A coupled thermo-chemical partial differential equation system is solved over the changing ink domain to simulate the heat transfer and chemical reaction during the printing process. The model is first validated by comparing the front temperature history during the printing process with the experimental infrared thermal measurements. The validated model enables the determination of proper printing velocity range, within which the polymerization front can follow the printing such that the ink will not deform before curing, which is critical to ensure printing accuracy. Furthermore, the simulation reveals the change of front temperature and degree of cure between different layers, and their dependency on layer length and printing velocity, providing insights into the printing experiments for processing parameters selection.

These remarkable propertiers make them useful across multiple industries; but also, difficult to mold into complex shapes. A possibility to make convoluted ceramic parts is to use preceramic polymers (PCPs) in liquid form. The PCP resin is first solidified in a desired geometry and then transformed into ceramic compounds through a pyrolysis step that preserves the shape. Light-based additive manufacturing (AM) is a promising route to achieve solidification of the PCP resin. Different approaches, such as stereolithography, have already been proposed but they all rely on a layer-by-layer printing process which limits printing speed and object geometry. Herein, the fabrication of complex 3D centimeter-scale ceramic parts by using tomographic volumetric printing is presented, which is fast and offers a high-resolution and geometrical design freedom. First, a photosensitive polysiloxane preceramic resin that is solidified by projecting light patterns from multiple angles is formulated. Then, the obtained 3D printed parts are converted into ceramics by pyrolysis. The strength of this approach is demonstrated through the fabrication of smooth, dense microcomponents exhibiting overhangs and hollow geometries without the need of supporting structures. Their resistance to thermal stress and harsh chemical treatments is characterized.

This work proposes a novel resistive sensor design that utilizes the geometric freedom offered by AM, especially by material extrusion, to enable a customizable and amplified response to force and deformation. This is achieved by using a multi-material design made of an elastomer and an electrically conductive polymer that enables a physical shortening of the conductive path under compressive load through a specific definition of shape. A number of different variants of this novel sensor design are tested, measuring their mechanical and electrical behavior under compression. The results of these tests confirm a strong resistive response to mechanical loading. Furthermore, the results provide insight into the influencing factors of the design, i.e., the gap size between the conductive pathing and the stiffness of the sense element support structure are found to be primary influencing factors governing sensor behavior.

However, the metal additive manufacturing techniques present the serious limitation that the melting of a magnetocaloric material can cause its transformation and the loss of functionality. Fused deposition modeling using polymer-based composite filaments is presented as a promising alternative as temperatures are low enough to preserve the magnetocaloric material. To prove this claim, a polymer-based composite filament containing 55 wt% of (La,Ce)(Fe,Mn,Si)13-H magnetocaloric fillers has been manufactured using custom-made polymer capsules as the feedstock for the extrusion.

A novel method for additive manufacturing of metal parts, Metal Additive manufacturing using Powder Sheets (MAPS), is hereby described. MAPS uses rollers of a novel composite material as feedstock, which eliminates the need for loose powder in the build chamber, potentially reducing risks and enhancing applications while still producing material on par with that produced by established PBF methods.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Failure criterion for PA12 SLS additive manufactured parts	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Failure criterion; SLS; PA12; Additive manufacturing	STRENGTH; FDM	In order to use selective laser sintering to manufacture structural parts for automotive and aerospace applications, the failure conditions of such a component must be understood and predicted. A 3D failure criterion for anisotropic materials that incorporates stress interactions is implemented to predict failure of selective laser sintered parts manufactured using polyamide 12 powder. Special test specimens that capture tensile, compressive and shear strengths, as single or combined loads, were designed, manufactured and tested. Results show that significant differences exist between tensile and compressive strengths, and that failure of additive manufactured parts is strongly influenced by the interaction between stresses. The test data shows an excellent fit with a tensor based failure criterion that includes interaction strength tensor components, thus being able to capture the strength behavior of SLS printed components under complex loading conditions. The study also demonstrated that work is still required to allow incorporation of some important stress interactions present in those complex stress fields.

Polymer-based AM processes allow the flexibility, rapid, and low-cost fabrication of complex geometries depending on the types of materials used. The purpose of this review article is to summarize the major AM methods, materials, and their emerging applications to additively manufacture the flexible structures. In the AM methods section, Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), and Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) are reviewed for fabrics, and Direct Ink Writing (DIW) for electronics. In the Materials section, the manufacturing methods, chemical structures, properties, advantages, and limitations of some of the widely used materials in three-dimensional (3D) printing of polymers are reviewed. Third, the applications of these methods and materials for fabrics, and electronics are covered. Finally, the associated opportunities and challenges in 3D printing process of flexible structures are described. The future research should be related to the exploration of combinations and development of innovative materials, printing process parameters, detail study on improving the properties, and hybrid 3D printing process.

AM has found applications in various industries including medical and aerospace for both prototyping and functional part fabrication. With rapid development in additive manufacturing technologies, the future of US manufacturing and economy clearly looks bright, process sustainability of such AM devices are not well studied. This paper addresses much needed sustainability aspects of additive manufacturing processes. More specifically, material wastage and energy consumption are two major concerns of the AM processes that requires immediate attention. In this research, process both at layer and part level enabling additive manufacturing process towards sustainability is formulated and optimized. Numerous real world examples are demonstrated and compared against conventional approaches to demonstrate the applicability of the developed approach. The models formulated here for selective laser sintering (SLS) process can be easily extended to other additive manufacturing technologies with little or no modification.

Additive manufacturing (AM) is a process that promises to impact all aspects of building construction profoundly. Of special interest in AM is an in-depth understanding of material systems based on their isotropic or anisotropic properties. The presented research focuses on fiber-reinforced polymers, with anisotropic mechanical properties ideally suited for AM applications that include tailored structural reinforcement. This article presents a cyber-physical manufacturing process that enhances existing robotic coreless Filament Winding (FW) methods for glass and carbon fiber-reinforced polymers. Our main contribution is the complete characterization of a feedback-based, sensor-informed application for process monitoring and fabrication data acquisition and analysis. The proposed AM method is verified through the fabrication of a large-scale demonstrator. The main finding is that implementing AM in construction through cyber-physical robotic coreless FW leads to more autonomous prefabrication processes and unlocks upscaling potential. Overall, we conclude that material-system-aware communication and control are essential for the efficient automation and design of fiber-reinforced polymers in future construction.

Because of the expansion of this technology in recent years, new materials and additives are being searched for to meet the growing demand. 3DP allows accurate fabrication of complicated models, however, structural anisotropy caused by the 3DP approaches could limit robust application. A possible solution to the inferior properties of the 3DP based materials compared to that of conventionally manufactured counterparts could be the incorporation of nanoparticles, such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) which have demonstrated remarkable mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. In this article we review some of the research, products, and challenges involved in 3DP technology. The importance of CNT dispersion in the matrix polymer is highlighted and the future outlook for the 3D printed polymer/CNT nanocomposites is presented.

Despite the contributions of great technical progress and material development towards optimizing this manufacturing method, different failure modes observed in the final printed products have hindered its application in producing large engineering structures used in aerospace and automotive industries. We report failure modes in a variety of printed polymer and composite parts, including fuel tanks and car bumpers. Delamination and warpage observed in these parts originate mostly from thermal gradients and residual stresses accumulated during material deposition and cooling. Because printing large structures requires expensive resources, process simulation to recognize the possible failure modes can significantly lower the manufacturing cost. In this regard, accurate prediction of temperature distribution using thermal simulations is the first step. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used for process simulation of large-scale robotic AM. The important steps of the simulation are presented, and the challenges related to the modeling are recognized and discussed in detail. The numerical results showed reasonable agreement with the temperature data measured by an infrared camera.

When the traps are beads, they are dispersed in a fluidized bed in a vessel where a pump guarantees fresh liquid inflow and waste outflow without washing out the cells. Scientific papers report numerous types of cell entrapment, but most of their applications remain at the laboratory level. In the present research, rigid polymer beads were manufactured by two different additive manufacturing (AM) techniques in order to verify the economy, reusability, and stability of the traps, with a view toward a straightforward industrial application. The proposed solutions allowed for overcoming some of the drawbacks of traditional manufacturing solutions, such as the limited mechanical stability of gel traps, and they guaranteed the possibility of producing parts of constant quality with purposely designed exchange surfaces, which are unfeasible when using conventional processes. AM proved to be a viable manufacturing solution for beads with complex shapes of two different size ranges. A deep insight into the production and characteristics of beads manufactured by AM is provided. The paper provides biotechnologists with a manufacturing perspective, and the results can be directly applied to transit from the laboratory to the industrial scale.

Dynamic stiffness modification by internal features in additive manufacturing	PRECISION ENGINEERING-JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETIES FOR PRECISION ENGINEERING AND NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Machining; Hybrid manufacturing; Structural dynamics; Dynamic stiffness	DESIGN	Dynamic stiffness, or the product of the modal stiffness and damping ratio, is an important consideration for the design of additively manufactured parts that will experience dynamic loading. This paper describes a demonstration component which was designed and manufactured in two configurations using a metal wire arc additive process. The first configuration was an open channel structure, while the second contained a dynamic absorber in the internal cavity. Frequency response measurements of the two components showed a significant magnitude reduction for the modified component at the original open channel structure's natural frequency and an overall increase in dynamic stiffness. Polymer damping material was then added to further increase the dynamic stiffness.

Additive Manufacturing for Contaminants: Ammonia Removal Using 3D Printed Polymer-Zeolite Composites	ACS ES&T WATER			English	Article						additive manufacturing; 3D printing; polymer composite; environmental monitoring water treatment; zeolite; ammonia	FRESH-WATER; CONFOUNDING FACTORS; CHRONIC TOXICITY; IDENTIFICATION; SEDIMENT; SITE; BIOASSAYS; LIFE; DERIVATION; CRITERIA	The diverse suite of contaminants released to the environment requires creative solutions. This research identifies novel application of additive manufacturing to rapidly prototype functional composite structures to adsorb contaminants. Ammonia contamination of water from natural and anthropogenic sources is common. Granular zeolite removes ammonia from water but is not easy to deploy and retrieve from environmental media. This work employed a 3D printer to customize deployable and retrievable devices that remove ammonia from water. Twin screw compounding of zeolite into polylactic acid (PLA) provided printable composites (approximate to 16 wt % zeolite). Simple placement of the printed structures in vials containing ammonia contaminated water (1.2-12.2 mg/L) significantly reduced concentrations (40-60%) under static water conditions relevant to bioassays or anoxic conditions. Surficial abrasion of composite surfaces may facilitate additional ammonia removal. Normalization to zeolite mass indicated printed PLA-zeolite composites performed comparably to free zeolite. Most ammonia removal occurred within 48 h, with diminishing benefit with longer exposure. This first-principles research demonstrated 3D printed devices remove ammonia from water. There is potential for future benefit through rapid prototyping to optimize efficacy via geometric complexity, higher filler loadings, uptake kinetics studies, and different filler-polymer pairings for additional contaminants.

Jerry			A hybrid additive manufacturing process for production of functional fiber-reinforced polymer composite structures	JOURNAL OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS			English	Article						Fiber reinforced polymer composites; multifunctional composites; additive manufacturing; hybrid 3D printing	3D; FABRICATION; CARBON; EPOXY; GLASS	Fiber reinforced polymer composites (FRPCs) are valued for their high strength and lightweight and have found applications from aerospace to renewable energy. Additive manufacturing (AM, or 3D printing) of FRPCs is of great interest in recent years due to the manufacturing flexibility offered by AM. Direct ink write (DIW) 3D printing is a popular choice for FRPC 3D printing due to its low cost and open framework for broad material choices. However, previously explored techniques for AM of FRPCs are hindered by heavy reliance on fiber orientation dictated by extrusion toolpath and often require specialized hardware to print FRPCs with low viscosity and long cure time thermoset epoxy matrices. In this paper, we introduce a single-stream hybrid DIW AM technique for the creation of mechanically robust FRPC functional structures where the matrix is DIW 3D printed, and pre-epoxy impregnated (prepreg) woven carbon fiber (CF) fabrics are robotically placed. Additionally, functional components, such as conductive elements, can be readily integrated. We investigated the impact of prepreg woven CF reinforcement on a two-stage photo-thermal thermoset resin matrix on the mechanical characteristics of manufactured FRPCs. We also combined these efforts to fabricate functional structures, including strain sensors for in-situ deformation monitoring, heating elements, and embedded light sensors. This study found that the proposed single-stream hybrid DIW AM process could be a facile approach to fabricate high-strength FRPC functional structures.

Part I: Real-Time Particulate and Gas-Phase Emissions	ACS CHEMICAL HEALTH & SAFETY			English	Article						additive manufacturing; 3-D printing; ultrafine particles; volatile organic compounds	3D PRINTER; THERMAL-DEGRADATION; ULTRAFINE PARTICLES; INDOOR; EXPOSURES	The literature on emissions during material extrusion additive manufacturing with 3-D printers is expanding; however, there is a paucity of data for large-format additive manufacturing (LFAM) machines that can extrude high-melt-temperature polymers. Emissions from two LFAM machines were monitored during extrusion of six polymers: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polycarbonate (PC), high-melt-temperature polysulfone (PSU), poly(ether sulfone) (PESU), polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), and Ultem (poly(ether imide)). Particle number, total volatile organic compound (TVOC), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations were monitored in real-time. Particle emission rate values (no./min) were as follows: ABS (1.7 x 10(11) to 7.7 x 10(13)), PC (5.2 x 10(11) to 3.6 x 10(13)), Ultem (5.7 x 10(12) to 3.1 x 10(13)), PPS (4.6 x 10(11) to 6.2 x 10(12)), PSU (1.5 x 10(12) to 3.4 x 10(13)), and PESU (2.0 to 5.0 x 10(13)). For print jobs where the mass of extruded polymer was known, particle yield values (g(-1) extruded) were as follows: ABS (4.5 x 10(8) to 2.9 x 10(11)), PC (1.0 x 10(9) to 1.7 x 10(11)), PSU (5.1 x 10(9) to 1.2 x 10(11)), and PESU (0.8 x 10(11) to 1.7 x 10(11)). TVOC emission yields ranged from 0.005 mg/g extruded (PESU) to 0.7 mg/g extruded (ABS). The use of wall-mounted exhaust ventilation fans was insufficient to completely remove airborne particulate and TVOC from the print room. Real-time CO monitoring was not a useful marker of particulate and TVOC emission profiles for Ultem, PPS, or PSU. Average CO2 and particle concentrations were moderately correlated (r(s) = 0.76) for PC polymer. Extrusion of ABS, PC, and four high-melt-temperature polymers by LFAM machines released particulate and TVOC at levels that could warrant consideration of engineering controls. LFAM particle emission yields for some polymers were similar to those of common desktop-scale 3-D printers.

In this contribution, the most relevant (thermal, thermo-mechanical, thermal-oxidative, hydrolysis) degradation mechanisms of polymer materials during processing are discussed, addressing conventional extrusion-based manufacturing, including mechanical recycling, and AM. An overview is given of the most important experimental characterization techniques, and it is explained how these can be connected with modeling tools. Case studies are incorporated, dealing with polyesters, styrene-based materials, and polyolefins, as well as the typical AM polymers. Guidelines are formulated in view of a better molecular scale driven degradation control.	[Ceretti, Daniel V.

Various techniques (e.g., stereolithography, digital light processing, and two-photon polymerization) that are compatible with this strategy have so far been widely investigated. This is due to their cost-viability, flexibility, and ability to design and manufacture complex geometric structures. Different platforms related to these techniques have been developed too, in order to meet up with modern technology demand. Most relevant to this review are the challenges faced by the researchers in using these 3D printing techniques for the fabrication of ceramic structures. These challenges often range from shape shrinkage, mass loss, poor densification, cracking, weak mechanical performance to undesirable surface roughness of the final ceramic structures. This is due to the brittle nature of ceramic materials. Based on the summary and discussion on the current progress of material-technique correlation available, here we show the significance of material composition and printing processes in addressing these challenges.

J	Weflen, E; Frank, MC				Weflen, Eric; Frank, Matthew Charles			Hybrid additive and subtractive manufacturing of multi-material objects	RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL			English	Article						Material interface; Hybrid manufacturing; Fused filament fabrication; Computer numerical control machining; Large-scale additive manufacturing; Multi-material components	SURFACE	Purpose This study presents a method for fabricating multi-material objects using a hybrid additive and subtractive approach. By hybridizing the material composition in addition to the fabrication process, functional requirements can be met more effectively than through homogenous material parts produced using a single manufacturing process. Development of multi-material objects consisting of dissimilar materials that have been hampered by a lack of a structural interface compatible with in-envelope hybrid additive and subtractive manufacturing. Design/methodology/approach This research presents a novel method for producing multi-material components through in-envelope hybrid additive and subtractive manufacturing. This study attempts to address the absence of a metal-polymer interface by integrating polymer additive manufacturing into a five-axis mill. The ability of the polymer additive system to reproduce overhang geometries is assessed with different levels of cooling. The relationship between structural performance, cooling and material flow rate is evaluated for the deposited carbon fiber reinforced acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. Findings A mechanically interlocking root structure is developed to form an interface between a machined aluminum region and a polymer region of an object. The tensile strength of the metal-polymer object is measured and found to be on the same order of magnitude as the bulk three-dimensional printed polymer. Originality/value By targeting the material properties to the local functional requirements within a part and taking advantage of both additive and subtractive manufacturing processes, this study will enable broader design options and optimization of performance metrics.

Screening of pharmaceutical polymers for extrusion-Based Additive Manufacturing of patient-tailored tablets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS			English	Article						Personalized medicine; Fused Filament Fabrication; Extrusion Based Additive Manufacturing; 3D printing; Thermoplastic polymers; Tailored release; Mechanical properties	HOT-MELT EXTRUSION; DRUG-RELEASE; DOSAGE FORMS; 3D; FABRICATION; IMMEDIATE; DEVICES; DESIGN	The main objective of this work was to explore the potential of coupling hot-melt extrusion (HME) to Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF), also known as Extrusion-Based Additive Manufacturing (EBAM) or 3D Printing, in order to manufacture 3D printed tablets with different release behavior from plasticizer-free filament matrices. The suitability of different thermoplastic polymers towards FFF was investigated, and a link between the mechanical properties of filaments produced by HME and the feeding performance into the FFF printer was established. Model drugs with different aqueous solubility (metoprolol tartrate and theophylline anhydrous) were processed with hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymers, and the influence of the formulation, drug concentration and applied process settings on the release kinetics was investigated. Filaments with up to 40% drug load were successfully extruded with a smooth surface and a diameter of 1.75 +/- 0.05 mm. However, filaments with high brittleness and low toughness were broken by the feeding gears. In contrast, none of the filaments were squeezed aside by the gears, which indicated that they were sufficiently stiff as indicated by the high Young's moduli of all formulations. For all formulations, the release from the tablets with 50% infill degree was faster as compared to the tablets with 100% infill degree. Theophylline (20% w/w) release from Kollicoat (R) IR matrix was completed within 40 min from 50% infill tablets. In contrast, 80% metoprolol tartrate was released from the hydrophobic Capa (R) 6506 polymer within 24hrs from 50% infill 3D tablets containing 40% w/w MPT.

Their low Young's modulus and yield point have encouraged researchers to find new coatings to overcome these limitations. In this paper, the friction and wear of PEEK are studied in a dry sliding environment (without lubrication) using a ball-on-disk tribometer and compared to those of Babbitt metal. Furthermore, the bond strength tests between PEEK and metals/alloys are evaluated. PEEK polymer samples were obtained from cylindrical rods, manufactured by an innovative process for polymer bonding on bearing surfaces, using additive manufacturing technology. The morphologies of the degraded surfaces were examined using a high-resolution metallurgical optical microscope (OM) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The coefficients of friction (CoF) were obtained under the alternating ball-on-disk dry tribometer. The results of the experimental activity show that PEEK polymers have CoFs of about 0.22 and 0.16 under the 1 and 5 N applied load, respectively. The CoF and wear volume loss results are reported and compared to the reference Babbitt coating.

The growth of such intelligent systems is primarily possible with innovative materials, which demonstrate the response to various external stimuli like temperature, heat, moisture, light, electromagnetic field, and chemical alteration. Such materials have been recently fabricated using different additive manufacturing techniques to devise personalized unique, complex, and novel structures that can adjust to external conditions over time and are specifically attributed to 4D printing. Novel materials that can further improve such systems continued to be explored and employed. This review paper investigates the additive manufacturing of functional polymer nanocomposites, which offer compliant structures with flexible manufacturing processes with high strength, low cost, and long-term stability.

Design, Manufacturing and Acoustic Assessment of Polymer Mouthpieces for Trombones	POLYMERS			English	Article						additive manufacturing; subtractive manufacturing; polymer composites; trombone; mouthpiece		Brass instruments mouthpieces have been historically built using metal materials, usually brass. With the auge of additive manufacturing technologies new possibilities have arisen, both for testing alternative designs and for using new materials. This work assesses the use of polymers for manufacturing trombone mouthpieces, specifically PLA and Nylon. The acoustical behavior of these two mouthpieces has been compared with the obtained from a third one, built from brass. Both additive and subtractive manufacturing techniques were used, and the whole manufacturing process is described. The mouthpieces were acoustically assessed in an anechoic chamber with the collaboration of a professional performer. The harmonic analysis confirmed that all the manufactured mouthpieces respect the harmonic behavior of the instrument. An energy analysis of the harmonics revealed slight differences between the mouthpieces, which implies differences in the timbre of the instrument. Although these subtle differences would not be acceptable when performing with the instrument in an orchestra, they could be perfectly valid for early learners, personal rehearsals or any kind of alternative performance.

The employment of biomaterials is of utmost relevance as the environmental footprint of the process and, consequently, of the end-goods is significantly decreased. Additive manufacturing can provide, in particular, an all-in-one platform to fabricate complex-shaped biobased items such as bone implants or biomedical devices, that would be, otherwise, extremely troublesome and costly to achieve. Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) is an emerging class of biobased and biodegradable polymeric materials achievable by fermentation from bacteria. There are some promising scientific and technical reports on the manufacturing of several commodities in PHAs by additive manufacturing. However, many challenges must still be faced in order to expand further the use of PHAs. In this framework, the present work reviews and classifies the relevant papers focused on the design and development of PHAs for different 3D printing techniques and overviews the most recent applications of this approach.

A promising approach to control membrane properties and overcome limitations of conventional fabrication techniques is given by additive manufacturing (AM). In this study, we designed and printed a microporous membrane via digital light processing and validated its use for biomedical in vitro applications based on the example of a cell culture insert. A multi-layer technique was developed, resulting in an eight-layer membrane with an average pore diameter of 25 mu m. Image analyses proved the printing accuracy to be high with small deviations for an increasing number of layers. Permeability tests with brilliant blue FCF (E133, triarylmethane dye) and growth factors comparing the printed to track-etched membranes showed similar transfer dynamics and confirmed sufficient separation properties. Overall, the results showed that printing microporous polymer membranes is possible and highlight the potential of AM for biomedical in vitro applications such as cell culture inserts, scaffolds for tissue engineering or bioreactors.

Poly(ether ester) lonomers as Water-Soluble Polymers for Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing Processes	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						poly(ethylene glycol); ionomers; material extrusion; additive manufacturing; counterion	DEPOSITION MODELING FDM; ETHER COMPLEXES; DELIVERY; COPOLYMERS; IONOMERS; RELEASE; TABLETS; IONS	Water-soluble polymers as sacrificial supports for additive manufacturing (AM) facilitate complex features in printed objects. Few water-soluble polymers beyond poly(vinyl alcohol) enable material extrusion AM. In this work, charged poly(ether ester)s with tailored rheological and mechanical properties serve as novel materials for extrusion-based AM at low temperatures. Melt transesterification of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, 8k) and dimethyl 5-sulfoisophthalate afforded poly(ether ester)s of sufficient molecular weight to impart mechanical integrity. Quantitative ion exchange provided a library of poly(ether ester)s with varying counterions, including both monovalent and divalent cations. Dynamic mechanical and tensile analysis revealed an insignificant difference in mechanical properties for these polymers below the melting temperature, suggesting an insignificant change in final part properties. Rheological analysis, however, revealed the advantageous effect of divalent countercations (Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) in the melt state and exhibited an increase in viscosity of two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, time temperature superposition identified an elevation in modulus, melt viscosity, and flow activation energy, suggesting intramolecular interactions between polymer chains and a higher apparent molecular weight. In particular, extrusion of poly(PEG(8k)-co-CaSIP) revealed vast opportunities for extrusion AM of well-defined parts. The unique melt rheological properties highlighted these poly(ether ester) ionomers as ideal candidates for low-temperature material extrusion additive manufacturing of water-soluble parts.

Large scale additive manufacturing of eco-composites	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIAL FORMING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Large-Scale; HDPE; Sawdust	3D; FABRICATION	The evolution of additive manufacturing processes is enabling the production of parts with improved dimensional accuracy, mechanical, physical and chemical properties [1]. New materials also contribute to this trend, and in this scope, eco-composites, materials with environmental and ecological advantages, which include natural polymers, have been acquiring increased relevance [2]. The purpose of this study is to develop composite material parts manufactured from recycled thermoplastics and natural fibres, in this case, wood residues. Additive manufacturing (fused deposition modelling) will be accomplished using a robot combined with extrusion unit. The objective is to access the influence of the main manufacturing parameters, such as temperature, distance between layers or deposition speed, on the final part characteristics, especially dimensional accuracy. Reverse engineering and several material analysis techniques will be employed to achieve this goal.	[Horta, J. F.; Simoes, F. J.

Nowadays, a new technique for rapid tooling, Additive Manufacturing (AM), can create customized products with more complex geometries and short life cycles (flexibility) in order to keep up with the new variables imposed by the manufacturing environment. In the last two decades, the migration from subtractive manufacturing to AM has materialized such products with reduced costs and cycle times. AM has been recently promoted to develop polymer molds for product manufacturing. This paper reviews the main findings in the literature concerning polymer molds created by AM compared to conventional (metal) molds obtained by subtractive manufacturing. Information about specific topics is scarce or nonexistent, for example, about the characterization of the most commonly injected materials and molds used in this type of technology, their mechanical properties (part and mold), designs for all types of geometries, and costs. These aspects are addressed in this literature review, highlighting the advantages of this alternative manufacturing process, which is considered a desirable technology worldwide.

J	Parnian, P; D'Amore, A				Parnian, Pooyan; D'Amore, Alberto			Fabrication of High-Performance CNT Reinforced Polymer Composite for Additive Manufacturing by Phase Inversion Technique	POLYMERS			English	Article						Additive Manufacturing; nanocomposite; high-performance polymer; Carbon nanotubes; mechanical properties; thermal properties	CARBON NANOTUBES; GLASS-FIBER; NANOCOMPOSITES; FUNCTIONALIZATION; SIMULATION; DISPERSION; SEPARATION	Additive Manufacturing (AM) of polymer composites has enabled the fabrication of highly customized parts with notably mechanical properties, thermal and electrical conductivity compared to un-reinforced polymers. Employing the reinforcements was a key factor in improving the properties of polymers after being 3D printed. However, almost all the existing 3D printing methods could make the most of disparate fiber reinforcement techniques, the fused filament fabrication (FFF) method is reviewed in this study to better understand its flexibility to employ for the proposed novel method. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a desirable reinforcement have a great potential to improve the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of 3D printed polymers. Several functionalization approaches for the preparation of CNT reinforced composites are discussed in this study. However, due to the non-uniform distribution and direction of reinforcements, the properties of the resulted specimen do not change as theoretically expected. Based on the phase inversion method, this paper proposes a novel technique to produce CNT-reinforced filaments to simultaneously increase the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties. A homogeneous CNT dispersion in a dilute polymer solution is first obtained by sonication techniques. Then, the CNT/polymer filaments with the desired CNT content can be obtained by extracting the polymer's solvent. Furthermore, optimizing the filament draw ratio can result in a reasonable CNT orientation along the filament stretching direction.

Recently, there has been interested in using EPD for additive manufacturing using reconfigurable electrodes. Here, we report the first projector-based light-directed electrophoretic deposition (EPD) system that uses projected digital masks to dynamically control the electric field, eliminating the need for physical photomasks. We demonstrate a resolution limit of 10 pm for the deposited feature, which corresponds to the limits of the optical system. Furthermore, the first 3D overhanging structure made with EPD is presented, which points to the ability to create architected cellular materials. These improvements open the possibility for EPD to be a true 3D additive manufacturing technique.

Due to these tool-free techniques, complex shape manufacturing becomes much more convenient in comparison to traditional machining. However, additive manufacturing comes with its inherent process characteristics of high surface roughness, which in turn effect fatigue strength as well as residual stresses. Therefore, in this paper, common post-processing techniques for additive manufactured (AM) parts were examined. The main objective was to analyze the finishing processes in terms of their ability to finish complicated surfaces and their performance were expressed as average surface roughness (Sa and Ra). The techniques were divided according to the materials they applied to and the material removal mechanism. It was found that chemical finishing significantly reduces surface roughness and can be used to finish parts with complicated geometry. Laser finishing, on the other hand, cannot be used to finish intricate internal surfaces. Among the mechanical abrasion methods, abrasive flow finishing shows optimum results in terms of its ability to finish complicated freeform cavities with improved accuracy for both polymer and metal parts. However, it was found that, in general, most mechanical abrasion processes lack the ability to finish complex parts. Moreover, although most of post-processing methods are conducted using single finishing processes, AM parts can be finished with hybrid successive processes to reap the benefits of different post-processing techniques and overcome the limitation of individual process.

Semi-Crystalline Polymer Blends for Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing Printability: A Case Study with Poly(ethylene terephthalate) and Polypropylene	MACROMOLECULAR MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						additive manufacturing; fused filament fabrication; polyethylene terephthalate; polypropylene; semi-crystalline polymers	PP-G-MA; MALEIC-ANHYDRIDE; CRYSTALLIZATION; MORPHOLOGY	Semi-crystalline polymers are an important class of materials for engineering applications due to their high modulus and barrier properties. Traditional manufacturing methods process semi-crystalline polymers via rigid molds and well-controlled temperature and pressure environments to handle the significant change in specific volume occurring during crystallization; however, material extrusion additive manufacturing does not use these features. This often leads to warpage-induced build failure in fused filament fabrication (FFF). To enable FFF of semi-crystalline polymers, this work investigates characteristics of immiscible polymer blends (e.g., disparate crystallization behavior and phase separation) to mitigate warping failure during printing. A series of poly(ethylene terephthalate)/polypropylene/polypropylene-graft-maleic anhydride blends are explored and the effect of thermal and morphological characteristics on printability is analyzed. It is shown that these blends can be extruded into filament and printed into a 3D structure. Extrapolations indicate that phase-separated blends with increased total crystallization half-time are beneficial for FFF printing.

The photoreactive resin system filled with 20 wt% SiC exhibits suitable viscosity characteristics, adequate stability against sedimentation, and a fast photocuring behavior. After printing and pyrolytic conversion, SiC particulates were well-dispersed within the polymer-derived SiOC matrix. A direct comparison with the unfilled polysiloxane-based resin system showed that the addition of particulate SiC increases handleability, reduces shrinkage, and significantly increases critical wall thicknesses up to 5 mm. The biaxial Ball-on-Three-Balls testing methodology yielded a characteristic strength of 325 MPa for SiOC/SiC composites. The results highlight the high potential of particle-filled pre -ceramic polymer systems toward the fabrication of high-performance SiC-based materials by lithography-based additive manufacturing.

FFSAM is advanced solid-state additive manufacturing for the printing of macro-scale components for large stress-bearing situations. With the FFSAM, layer by layer printing of polymer and metal sheets convert to paste phase and join together as a uniform structure. With this process, during printing of hybrid structure, nanocomposite polymer is injected at the interface of base materials to fill voids and recover properties of the polymer matrix: polypropylene (PP) and stainless steel (SS) fabric selected as raw materials. During the printing process, Fe2O3 nanoparticles fed into the interface of PP and steel sheets. The mechanical and metallurgical characterization of printed PP@SS@Fe2O3 nanocomposite structure is evaluated. Macrostructure, tensile strength, hardness, and thermo-chemical properties of the printed structure were assessed and discussed. The result indicated that the In-situ feeding mechanism improves the physical and chemical properties of the printed structure. Reasonable properties achieved due to minimizing shrinkage gap in polymer side and improving sealing adhesion at interfaces of printed materials. (C) 2022 CIRP.

Design/methodology/approach Mechanic models are developed for obtaining designs of foam cell units with enhanced elastic buckling. An experimental approach is taken to fabricate the foams based on direct ink writing technique. Experimental and simulation data are collected to assist understanding of our proposals and solutions. Findings A simple tetragonal structured elastomeric foam is proposed and fabricated by direct ink writing, in which its cell unit is theoretically designed by repeating every four filament layers. The foam exhibits a broader stress plateau, because of the pronounced elastic buckling under compressive loading as predicted by the authors' mechanic modeling. A two-stage stress plateaus as observed in the foam, being attributed to the dual elastic buckling of the cell units along two lateral directions of the XY plane during compression. Research limitations/implications Future work should incorporate more microscopic parameters to tune the elastomeric foam for mechanic performance testing on linear elastic deformation and densification of polymer matrix. Practical implications Additive manufacturing offers an alternative to fabricate elastomeric foam with controlled cell unit design and therefore mechanics. Our results comment on its broad space for development such superior cushioning or damping material in the fields of vibration and energy absorption. Originality/value This work has contributed to new knowledge on preparation of high performance elastomeric foam by providing a better understanding on its cell structure, being printed using direct ink writing machines.

The printed part needs sufficient adhesion to the build plate. The adhesion in between the printed material layers defines the mechanical strength of the component. Post-processing processes such as painting or bonding require good chemical coupling, as does the combination of different materials (FDM of different polymers, integration of metal inserts). Unfortunately, sufficient adhesion is not given for all material combinations. An interesting and flexible possibility to influence the surface chemistry and thus the chemical bonding are surface functionalization by using atmospheric pressure plasma technologies. These have been used for many years with great success for the surface treatment of polymers. Depending on the plasma parameters used, it is possible to clean and etch surfaces, to functionalise surfaces with reactive chemical groups, to deposit layers or to cross-link polymers. While this is already used for treatment of 2D and 3D substrates in many applications, the integration of new functionalities by plasma into additive manufacturing processes is of great interest. This allows new functionalities to be integrated into 3D-printed components and simplifies further processing. At the Fraunhofer IST various approaches of small atmospheric pressure plasma sources are under development which can be easily integrated into the additive manufacturing process. Small point-shaped plasma modules for the sequential treatment of defined areas were built-up and integrated into commercially available FDM printers. With these plasma sources, the plasma treatment of defined areas of the components is possible during 3D printing. Integrated plasma sources enable moreover the in-situ treatment of internal surfaces which are subsequently no longer accessible for other treatment processes. This can create new products and expand the scope of additive manufacturing.

Currently, AM is used for tooling and sandwich cores with added functionalities. This paper presents four design principles that improve the production of composites parts during layup, handling, curing and post processing in the layup process. Design principles are applied to a hat-stiffener, a highly integrated aircraft instrument panel and a novel insert eliminating drilling operations. Results show that AM can reduce the part count, assembly steps and deformations during curing. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

These cost barriers can be surmounted by eliminating the entire process of fusing filament by three-dimensional (3-D) printing products directly from polymer granules. Fused granular fabrication (FGF) (or fused particle fabrication (FPF)) is being held back in part by the accessibility of low-cost pelletizers and choppers. An open-source 3-D printable invention disclosed here allows for precisely controlled pelletizing of both single thermopolymers as well as composites for 3-D printing. The system is designed, built, and tested for its ability to provide high-tolerance thermopolymer pellets with a number of sizes capable of being used in an FGF printer. In addition, the chopping pelletizer is tested for its ability to chop multi-materials simultaneously for color mixing and composite fabrication as well as precise fractional measuring back to filament. The US$185 open-source 3-D printable pelletizer chopper system was successfully fabricated and has a 0.5 kg/h throughput with one motor, and 1.0 kg/h throughput with two motors using only 0.24 kWh/kg during the chopping process. Pellets were successfully printed directly via FGF as well as indirectly after being converted into high-tolerance filament in a recyclebot.

It is well known that maintaining the deposited filaments at a high temperature aids in the process of adhesion and merging. While external mechanisms such as laser and infrared heating have been used in the past to heat up deposited filaments, this paper presents a simpler, less invasive and in situ mechanism for heating of previously deposited layers using a hot metal block integrated with and rastering together with the filament-dispensing nozzle. Infrared thermography based quantitative measurement of temperature field along the raster line is carried out for two configurations - a preheater and a postheater traveling ahead of or behind the nozzle respectively. In each case, significant temperature rise in the deposited filaments is shown. A configuration comprising both preheater and postheater is shown to result in additional thermal benefits. The measured temperature rise is shown to be a function of process parameters such as raster speed and heater-to-base gap. Experimental measurements are shown to agree well with theoretical and simulation models. Cross-section imaging of samples printed without and with the in situ heating clearly show significant improvement in neck growth and filament-to-filament merging compared to the baseline case. Improvement in thermal and structural performance of printed samples is also demonstrated. Compared to other techniques proposed in the past, the heating approach presented in this work is passive and requires minimal additional costs or complexity. The improved temperature field and consequently enhanced filament adhesion reported here may help design and build parts with superior thermal and mechanical properties using polymer AM.

J	Matuszczyk, D; Weichert, F				Matuszczyk, Daniel; Weichert, Frank			Reading Direct-Part Marking Data Matrix Code in the Context of Polymer-Based Additive Manufacturing	SENSORS			English	Article						neural networks; additive manufacturing; direct-part marking		A novel approach to detect and decode direct-part-marked, low-contrast data matrix codes on polymer-based selective laser sintering manufactured parts, which is able to work on lightweight devices, is presented. Direct-part marking is a concept for labeling parts directly, which can be carried out during the additive manufacturing's design process. Because of low contrast in polymer-based selective laser sintering manufactured parts, it is a challenging task to detect and read codes on unicolored parts. To achieve this, at first, codes are located using a deep-learning-based approach. Afterwards, the calculated regions of interest are passed into an image encoding network in order to compute readable standard data matrix codes. To enhance the training process, rendered images, improved with a generative adversarial network, are used. This process fulfills the traceability task in assembly line production and is suitable for running on mobile devices such as smartphones or cheap sensors placed in the assembly line. The results show that codes can be localized with 97.38% mean average precision, and a readability of 89.36% is achieved.

In this study, we developed an ultraviolet light-curable preceramic polymer slurry, and this slurry was used for digital light processing printing of flexible green parts in designed shapes. These parts were subsequently transformed into complex structures by an assisted secondary molding strategy that enabled the morphology of their green and pyrolyzed forms to be well controlled. The collapse of bulk pyrolyzed parts was avoided by impregnating their precursors with silicon nitride (Si3N4) particles. The effects of different proportions of Si3N4 on the weight loss, shrinkage, density, porosity, and mechanical properties of the pyrolyzed composites were investigated, and the bending strength and Vickers hardness of the composites with 10 wt.% Si3N4 were found to be 130.61 +/- 16.01 MPa and 6.43 +/- 0.12 GPa, respectively.

In recent years, applications and advantages of additive manufacturing have been expanding and providing opportunities to researchers and scholars for more options in it. AM techniques and process have maximum potential to work and develop intricate designs with simplicity and negligible wastage of raw material. Time is required for deep understanding of process and application for which it is being used.

This makes it essential to consider flame-retardant polymers in critical applications, such as aircraft, automobile, and building interior designs. Conventional flame-retardant methods are dependent on either adding halogen or phosphorous based chemicals to achieve the required attributes. There are also polymeric options that are intrinsically fire-resistant and can satisfy the fire safety regulatory standards such as the UL94 or FAR 25.853. However, the window of options is quite narrow, considering other aspects such as the eco-friendliness, mechanical or chemical properties, and processing difficulties. On the other hand, additive manufacturing technologies are gaining ground in recent times, gradually making application potentials in both automotive and aerospace industries. Considering the point-by-point or line-by-line material consolidation mechanics, the fire-retardant options will further shrink if they have to be processed by additive methods. Research has led to specific options such as the Nylon FR series, ULTEM series, PAEK, and PEEK, processed by both selective laser sintering and fused deposition modelling. This paper reviews the current state of the additive processing of fire-retardant materials, clearly elucidating the material, process, structure, and property relationships and the fire-retardant standards.

Additive manufacturing devices are now so economical that home improvement stores are marketing them to the do-it-yourself (DIY) home improvement market. Rapidly maturing AM applications and material choices include metals, polymers, and ceramics but concrete has not achieved the same level of acceptance or advancement. Isolated and prototypical AM concrete applications have been implemented but widespread adoption may require intense material science research and technological innovations.

Although there has been research advances in material usage in AM technologies, optimal selection of AM materials has not been thoroughly researched. As there are many candidate materials for any application starting with a range of polymers, the most common AM material's type, metals and ceramics, this paper introduces an integrated heuristic and mathematical algorithms for optimizing the material selection for different AM applications. In addition, a material selection matrix is developed to rank recommended materials based on weighted criteria depending on the application.

Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing with Polyethylene Vitrimers	POLYMERS			English	Article						polyethylene; vitrimers; 3D printing; material extrusion; additive manufacturing; anisotropy; annealing	DENSITY POLYETHYLENE; 3D; POLYMER	Polyethylene (PE) is one of the most widely used polymers in conventional polymer manufacturing processes. However, it remains a challenge to use PE in extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM). Some of the challenges that this material presents include low self-adhesion and shrinkage during the printing process. These two issues lead to higher mechanical anisotropy when compared to other materials, along with poor dimensional accuracy and warpage. Vitrimers are a new class of polymers that have a dynamic crosslinked network, allowing the material to be healed and reprocessed. Prior studies on polyolefin vitrimers suggest that the crosslinks reduce the degree of crystallinity and increase the dimensional stability at elevated temperatures. In this study, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and HDPE vitrimers (HDPE-V) were successfully processed using a screw-assisted 3D printer. It was demonstrated that HDPE-V were able to reduce shrinkage during the printing process. This shows that 3D printing with HDPE-V will provide better dimensional stability when compared to regular HDPE. Furthermore, after an annealing process, 3D-printed HDPE-V samples showed a decrease in mechanical anisotropy. This annealing process was only possible in HDPE-V due to their superior dimensional stability at elevated temperatures, with minimal deformation above melting temperature.

Predicting material properties for embedded structures created with polymer material extrusion additive manufacturing	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Design for additive manufacturing; Embedding with material extrusion; Cavity design	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; STRENGTH; DEPENDENCE	Embedding with additive manufacturing (AM) is a process of incorporating functional components, such as sensors and actuators, in the printed structure by inserting them into a specially designed cavity. The print process has to be interrupted after the cavity is printed to insert the component. This allows for multifunctional structures to be created directly from the build plate. However, previous research has shown that this process interruption causes failure at the paused layer due to the cooling between the layers. The presence of the designed cavity further impacts the strength of the part due to a reduction in the effective cross-section in contact between the paused and the resumed layers. This research presents a methodology to predict the weld strength between the layers of an embedded material extrusion structure by obtaining the thermal history at the layer interface as a result of process interruption. An infrared camera and an embedded thermocouple are used to obtain the thermal history of the depositing fresh layer and of the layer interface, respectively. The impact of toolpath design on the thermal history of the layer interface is considered by dividing the cross-section area into zones with similar thermal history. Polymer weld theory is utilized to predict the strength at these different zones, where material properties are obtained through rheology measurements. These strength values for the zones are then used to predict the load at failure for different specimens by treating them as composites. Findings confirm that this approach can be used to more accurately predict tensile loads at failure for embedded structures, with errors ranging from 1% to 20 % depending on the toolpath geometry.

High resolution additive manufacturing like microstereolithography is largely associated with polymers. Polymers are at a disadvantage compared to other materials due to their softness and low chemical resistance. Whenever high chemical and thermal resistance combined with high optical transparency is needed, glasses become the material of choice. However, glasses are difficult to structure at the microscale requiring hazardous chemicals for etching processes. In this work we present additive manufacturing and high resolution patterning of microfluidic chips in transparent fused silica glass using stereolithography and microlithography. We print an amorphous silica nanocomposite at room temperature using benchtop stereolithography printers and a custom built microlithography system based on a digital mirror device. Using microlithography we printed structures with tens of micron resolution. The printed part is then converted to a transparent fused silica glass using thermal debinding and sintering. Printing of a microfluidic chip can be done within 30 minutes. The heat treatment can be done within two days.	[Kotz, F.; Helmer, D.; Rapp, B.

In particular, the synthesis of polypyrrole-coated acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) composites can be considered an important step to produce conductive supports for 3D printing. Herein, it is reported the production of ABS samples through the additive manufacturing process (3D printing) accordingly to the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) method. The hydrophilic behavior was controlled by the surface treatment using air plasma for the following step of coating with polypyrrole (PPy) via an in situ polymerization, using two different oxidants: ferric chloride (FeCl3.6H2O) and ammonium persulfate (APS). The chemical, optical, surface, and electrical properties of these materials were characterized through Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), contact angle measurements, cyclic voltammetry, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), 4-probe electrical measurement, and mechanical tensile testing. The ABS/PPy (FeCl3) composite exhibited a low electrical contact resistance and better performance for applications that require electrodes with a good conductance level.	[Silveira, Jose Victor B.

Additive manufacturing of glass has the potential to open new possibilities in design and reduce costs associated with manufacturing complex customized glass structures that are difficult to shape with traditional casting or subtractive methods. However, despite the significant progress in the additive manufacturing of metals, polymers, and ceramics, limited research has been undertaken on additive manufacturing of glass. In this study, a laser powder bed fusion method was developed for soda lime silica glass powder feedstock. Optimization of laser processing parameters was undertaken to define the processing window for creating three-dimensional multilayer structures. These findings enable the formation of complex glass structures with micro- or macroscale resolution. Our study supports laser powder bed fusion as a promising method for the additive manufacturing of glass and may guide the formation of a new generation of glass structures for a wide range of applications.

J	Prajapati, H; Salvi, SS; Ravoori, D; Jain, A				Prajapati, Hardikkumar; Salvi, Swapnil S.; Ravoori, Darshan; Jain, Ankur			Measurement of the in-plane temperature field on the build plate during polymer extrusion additive manufacturing using infrared thermometry	POLYMER TESTING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Polymer extrusion; Temperature measurement; Infrared thermography	THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; FILAMENT TEMPERATURE; HEAT-TRANSFER; DEPOSITION; NOZZLE; BONE; BED	The process of filament-to-filament adhesion during polymer extrusion additive manufacturing (AM) is critically influenced by temperature distribution around the filament. Direct measurement of temperature distribution around the filament being deposited is, therefore, important for fully understanding this critical process. While past papers have reported side-view (x-z) temperature measurement using infrared (IR) thermography, this paper presents measurement of the in-plane (x-y) temperature field on the build plate during printing of the first layer by infrared thermography. This measurement is carried out from under the build plate. A small part of the build plate is replaced by an infrared-transparent window. In conjunction with an infrared right-angle prism mirror positioned underneath, direct measurement of in-plane temperature distribution is carried out with an infrared camera. With a thin graphite coating on the build plate, in-plane temperature field on the build plate is obtained, whereas experiments without the graphite coating result in direct measurement of the filament temperature distribution. Bottom-view measurements are shown to agree well with side-view measurements. Temperature fields on the build plate are measured as functions of time for single-line and multi-line printing. A few key features revealed by measurements include symmetrical and asymmetrical temperature distributions for single and multi-line printing, respectively, and the thermal influence between lines being limited only to the adjacent line. The in-plane temperature measurement approach complements past side-view measurements, and improves upon our understanding of thermal phenomena during polymer AM.

Meanwhile, the yield strength is one of the key properties of a material, which critically affects a component's manufacturing and further application. To reveal the effect of printing parameters such as layer thickness, printing speed and deposition orientation on the yield strength of ME polymers without extensive experimental researches, a novel, integrated prediction model accounting for processing-structure-property relationship is put forward. In this model, processing related representative volume element (RVE) of unidirectional ME polymers is firstly estimated by combining the volume conservation method and thermal-sintering model. Next, assuming raw polymers to be homogenous, isotropic, and ideal elastic-plastic, a multiscale approach integrating Hill model and homogenization theory is presented to acquire the stress-strain curves of anisotropic ME polymers under externally applied loadings. In this procedure, the dependence of RVE's estimated anisotropic parameters in Hill model on their external loading states is paid attention. By this means, the three-dimensional yield behavior of ME polymers, including the off-axis yield strength, can be obtained. The validity of the proposed method is examined by comparing with existing test data in literature or our measured ones. Finally, explicit discussions are made. Many valuable conclusions are drawn, which may be of unique significance for the future processing optimization and quality improvement of final products.

In polymer metallization via cold spray, solid metallic powder is accelerated by a supersonic stream of preheated gas and propelled toward a polymer substrate, where it is built layer-by-layer via impact-induced heating and particle deformation. Since the pioneering study at Cambridge in 2006, nearly 50 experimental reports on polymer metallization via cold spray have been published, half of which have appeared within the past three years. This review distinguishes cold spray from other thermal spray methods, analyzes the peculiarities of cold spraying on polymers and fiber-reinforced composites, outlines the historical establishment of the field, and summarizes the available literature on polymer metallization via cold spray. The major focus here is on the influence of the cold spray process parameters on the deposition efficiency, adhesion strength, electrical conductivity and other properties of metallic coatings formed on polymers and fiber-reinforced composites. The promising applications of cold spray additive manufacturing in lightning strike protection, electroplating, osseointegration, antifouling, antivirus, e.g. anti-Covid-19 surfaces, and other surface functionalizations have been reviewed. Finally, recommendations were given on how to enhance the data reuse in future studies on polymer metallization via cold spray.

Rapid tooling provided by generative manufacturing has been suggested recently in the context of metal forming. Due to the high loads applied during processes to such tooling, a purposeful mechanical description of the additively manufactured (AM) materials is crucial. Until now, a comprehensive characterization approach for AM polymers is required to allow a sophisticated layout of rapid tooling. In detail, information on compressive and flexural mechanical properties of solid infilled materials made by additive manufacturing are sparsely available. These elementary mechanical properties are evaluated in the present study. They result from material specimens additively manufactured in the fused filament fabrication (FFF) process. The design of the experiments reveals significant influences of the polymer and the layer height on the resulting flexural and compressive strength and modulus as well as density, hardness, and surface roughness. As a case study, these findings are applied to a cup drawing operation based on the strongest and weakest material and parameter combination. The obtained data and results are intended to guide future applications of direct polymer additive tooling. The presented case study illustrates such an application and shows the range of manufacturing quality achievable within the materials and user settings for 3D printing.

The design freedom afforded by AM is ideal for the space industry, where part production is low volume and highly customized. The objective of this paper is to review research in the area of additive manufacturing for space (AMFS) in all areas, from propulsion to electronics to printing of habitats, and to identify the gaps and directions in the research. In this paper, we investigate the AMFS research by splitting it into two domains: space and ground-based. Space-based AMFS has been performed on the International Space Station using polymers, and we also discuss the future of in space AM, a subject closely related to more general in space manufacturing. The ground-based research is split into three categories based on the printing material: metal, polymer, and others. The last category includes regolith, cement, and ceramic. This paper explores AMFS by bringing together as much research information as possible using a combination of papers, presentations, and news articles. We expect that the paper will allow the reader to gain an understanding of the current status of AMFS research and will contribute to the field as a reference and research guidelines.

M.; Carpenter, Everett E.; Hadimani, Ravi L.; Zhao, Hong; Barua, Radhika			Room-temperature polymer-assisted additive manufacturing of microchanneled magnetocaloric structures	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Extrusion-based additive manufacturing; 3D-printed magnetocaloric regenerators; Active magnetic regenerative (AMR); refrigeration technology	MN; CRYSTALLIZATION; HYSTERESIS; FE; CO	Magnetic refrigeration is an energy-efficient, sustainable, environmentally-friendly alternative to the conventional vapor-compression cooling technology. There are several magnetic refrigerator device designs in existence today that are predicted to be highly energy-efficient, on condition that suitable working materials can be developed. This challenge in manufacturing magnetocaloric devices is unresolved, mainly due to issues related to shaping the mostly brittle magnetocaloric alloys into thin-walled channeled regenerator structures to facilitate efficient heat transfer between the solid refrigerant and the heat exchange fluid in an active magnetic regenerator (AMR) cooling device. To address this challenge, a novel extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) method has been developed to 3D print microchanneled magnetocaloric structures. The printing ink consists of magnetocaloric powders, a polymer binder, and multiple solvents to achieve desirable shear-thinning property, which is critical for a robust printing process. Acting as a sacrificial binding agent for the magnetic powders, the polymer binder holds the 3D printed structures in place and is removed subsequently using a two-step heat-treatment process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the fabrication process, spatially designed microchannels with minimum dimensions of 150 mu m were achieved using nanoscaled La0.6Ca0.4MnO3 powders (diameter~10 nm). Results indicate that the crystallographic properties and magnetofunctional response of the sintered 3D printed samples are comparable to that of the precursor powders. Overall, this study provides a promising route for realizing lowcost magnetic regenerators, thus potentially eliminating one of the main barriers to the commercialization of magnetic cooling technology.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

To reveal the underlying deposition mechanisms during the polymer powder-impacting process, the microstructure, thermal and mechanical properties of deposited samples are examined and compared with those of the as-received and fully cured materials. It is found that severe plastic deformation, partial melting, and curing reaction (including latent curing agent decomposition and cross-link reaction) occur simultaneously to form the bonding. However, due to the insufficient heat generation for complete cross-linking reaction, a postheat treatment is needed to improve the mechanical properties of the fabricated objects, where a low heating rate is necessary to maintain the sample geometry.

A statistical homogenization approach for incorporating fiber aspect ratio distribution in large area polymer composite deposition additive manufacturing property predictions	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Polymer composites; Large area additive manufacturing; Fiber aspect ratio distribution; Fiber orientation homogenization; Elastic properties	ELASTIC PROPERTIES; ORIENTATION; LENGTH; SUSPENSIONS; DEGRADATION; INCLUSIONS; BEHAVIOR; DAMAGE; MODEL; FLOW	Assessing the material stiffness of fiber reinforced polymer composites deposited in Large Area Additive Manufacturing (LAAM) is needed to define the process-structure-property mapping for the LAAM technology. While the screw-extrusion-based LAAM systems yield a distribution of fiber aspect ratio (i.e., length to diameter ratio for cylindrical inclusions) within deposited beads, most composite micromechanical models ignore the fiber geometry variation and instead assume a single value of fiber aspect ratio. This paper presents a statistics-based homogenization approach for including the fiber aspect ratio distribution in the prediction of the elastic properties of an extruded polymer composite bead. The fiber length distribution of a 13 wt% Carbon Fiber reinforced Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (CF-ABS) processed through a LAAM deposition system is measured using high resolution optical microscopy. The Weibull probability distribution function is employed to statistically describe the measured values. The fitted probability density function is then incorporated into a fiber orientation homogenization approach to compute the variability of the elastic properties of the extruded composite. Elastic properties predicted by our proposed method are shown to differ from those presented in prior studies that ignored fiber length variability. The fiber aspect ratio reduction from fiber length attrition during the LAAM single screw-extrusion is shown to decrease the predicted flow-direction effective elastic modulus by 7%. Elastic moduli computed using our measured fiber aspect ratio distribution and proposed homogenization approach compare well to reported data from previously associated experimental studies.

Additive manufacturing under pressure	RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL			English	Article						Mechanical properties; 3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Pressure; Selective laser printing; Thermoplastic elastomers	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; LASER; POWDER; CONSOLIDATION; FABRICATION; PARAMETERS; ANISOTROPY	Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the effects on material properties of layer-by-layer application of pressure during fabrication of polymeric parts by additive manufacturing (AM). Although AM, also known popularly as 3D printing, has set a new standard for ease of use and minimal restraint on geometric complexity, the mechanical part properties do not generally compare with conventional manufacturing processes. Contrary to other types of polymer processing, AM systems do not normally use (in-process) pressure during part consolidation. Design/methodology/approach - Tensile specimens were produced in Somos 201 using conventional laser sintering (LS) and selective laser printing (SLP) - a process under development in the UK, which incorporates the use of pressure to assist layer consolidation. Findings - Mechanical testing demonstrated the potential to additively manufacture parts with significantly improved microstructure and mechanical properties which match or exceed conventional processing. For example, the average elongation at break and ultimate tensile strength of a conventionally laser-sintered thermoplastic elastomer (Somos 201) increased from 136 +/- 28 per cent and 4.9 +/- 0.4 MPa, to 513 +/- 35 per cent and 10.4 +/- 0.4 MPa, respectively, when each layer was fused with in-process application of pressure (126 +/- 9 kPa) by SLP. Research limitations/implications - These results are based on relatively small sample size, but despite this, the trends observed are of significant importance to the elimination of voids and porosity in polymeric parts. Practical implications - Layerwise application of pressure should be investigated further for defect elimination in AM. Originality/value - This is the first study on the effects of layerwise application of pressure in combination with area-wide fusing.

A total of 14 photocurable 3D-printing polymers were chosen, owing to their suitability, in terms of printing resolution, material characteristics, and so on, for millimeter-wave (mm-wave) and THz applications. The measurement results from 0.2 to 1.4THz, the dielectric constants of all photopolymer samples under test are between 2.00-3.10, while the loss tangents are from 0.008 to 0.102, which are quite useful for many applications, e.g., 3D printed antennas and THz transmission lines, which were demonstrated by an asymptotically quasi-single-mode Bragg fiber microfabricated by DLP micromanufacturing technique using HTM140-V2 photopolymer, which is previously reported at the nominal frequencies from 0.246 to 0.276 THz.

New paradigms have to be considered for mould design, assuming that additive manufacturing enables the definition of different architectures that are able to improve the performance of the moulding process. This work describes the strategies adopted for the design and manufacturing by Laser powder bed fusion of the moulds, taking into specific consideration their functional surfaces, which rule the heat transfer to the moulded material, hence the quality of the products and the overall performance of the steam-chest process. The description of a case study and the comparison between the performance of the traditional solution and the new moulds are also presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach. This study demonstrates that the re-design and optimization of the mould shape can lead to a significant reduction of the energy demand of the process, thanks to a homogeneous delivery of the heating steam throughout the part volume, which also results in a remarkable cutting of the cycle time.

Optical interconnects on a flexible substrate by multi-material hybrid additive and subtractive manufacturing	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Shape deposition manufacturing; Flexible optoelectronics; Additive manufacturing of flexible electronics; Flexible photonics	FABRICATION; INTEGRATION; DESIGN; FILM	The integration of flexible photonic components into flexible electronics provides new opportunities for applications in imaging, sensing, and optical interconnection between devices. While most photonic devices are currently printed on rigid substrates, their integration on flexible polymer substrates has also been demonstrated in recent years. However, current technology of contact and non-contact processes limits the type and performance of optical devices on these flexible substrates and requires special processes or product design to get the entry and exit of optical interconnect end facets out of the substrate plane. Here, we show that by utilizing recent advances in additive manufacturing, we can print photonic interconnects directly on flexible substrates. For our proof-of-concept devices, our results demonstrate propagation losses of about 0.35 dB for the six cm samples, negligible changes in transmission losses through substrate bending at moderate bend radii down to about 5 mm, and no change in optical losses during fatigue testing up to 1000 cycles. These results demonstrate how flexible photonic devices can be produced using additive manufacturing techniques. A type of shape deposition manufacturing, laser enhanced-direct print additive manufacturing, is used to manufacture these devices. This system of micro-dispensing, fused filament fabrication, and laser subtraction has a unique ability to produce flexible optoelectronics in a single automated process.

Four tasks were completed. First, PP as the major binder, replaced with some EVA, to improve the flexibility of the filaments. The compatibility of PP and EVA was also investigated by grafting maleic acid (MA) on PP chain to reduce different polarity between PP and EVA. The third task was to study the dispersion condition of the alumina powder in feedstocks, and quantitatively investigated the influence by kneading sequences, solid content, and other processing parameters. After optimization the processing conditions, the made alumina parts were densified to a relative density better than 98% in a linear sintering shrinkage of 16%-21%.	[Fan, N. C.; Wei, W. C.

The models presented in this paper are divided into those that are manufactured for the purpose of visual presentation and those that directly serve the needs of the manufacturing process. The authors also a propose a comprehensive control system for the additive manufacturing process to meet the needs of Industry 4.0. Depending on the intended use of the models, the quality control process is divided into three stages: data control, manufacturing control, and post-processing control. Research models were made from the following materials: RGD 720 photopolymer resin (PolyJet method), ABS M30 thermoplastic (FDM method), E-Partial photopolymer resin (DLP method), PLA thermoplastic (FFF method), and ABS thermoplastic (MEM method). The applied measuring tools had an accuracy of at least an order of magnitude higher than that of the manufacturing technologies used. The results show that the PolyJet method is the most accurate, and the MEM method is the least accurate. The findings also confirm that the selection of materials, 3D printing methods, and measurement methods should always account not only for the specificity and purpose of the model but also for economic aspects, as not all products require high accuracy and durability.

However, take-up for series production in the automotive industry is still slow and limited to very few materials. Therefore, this review assesses compatibility of polymer AM processes and materials and provides a method to check their formal applicability for automotive series part production. The proposed material and process selection method applies basic automotive requirements derived from the VDA 232-201 industry standard and an interior part case study. Materials and processes in AM are put into context via material selection charts and a process compatibility index. This graphical analysis enables first judgement about applicability and subsequent pre-selection of materials and processes. Insights may help users, equipment manufacturers and material developers in the fields of AM to match automotive requirements and reduce barriers for adoption of AM in series part manufacturing.

AddJoining: A novel additive manufacturing approach for layered metal-polymer hybrid structures	MATERIALS LETTERS			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Aluminum 2024-T3; ABS; Carbon-fiber-reinforced polyamide-6; Composite materials; Laminates		A novel assembling technique based on additive manufacturing and materials joining principles has been introduced for layered metal-polymer hybrid structures. The AddJoining technique produces layered hybrid structures, using polymer 3D printing methods. The feasibility of the technique was demonstrated using fused deposition modeling for single-lap joint configuration. Microstructure and mechanical strength of the joints were studied using two combinations of materials; aluminum 2024-T3 with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and aluminum 2024-T3 with alternate layers of polyamide-6 and carbon-fiber-reinforced polyamide-6. The latter reached an average ultimate lap-shear strength of 21.9 +/- 1.1MPa, showing 19% superior performance to the adhesively bonded joints. This exploratory investigation showed the potential of AddJoining to produce metal-polymer layered structures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Falck, R.; Goushegir, S. M.; dos Santos, J.

Using nanomaterials to enhance the additive manufacturing of polymeric resins	NANO FUTURES			English	Editorial Material						nanomaterials; additive manufacturing; 3D printing	NANOCOMPOSITE	Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies, also called 3D printing, have dramatically developed over the past decade to allow new capabilities in materials processing with printed resolution comparable to that of traditional manufacturing techniques. Sequential layer deposition can lead to the creation of complex parts with minimized material waste, high manufacturing throughput, and increased prototyping ability, while also meeting the demand for mid- and low-volume production. The AM of polymer nanocomposites is a growing area of research because nanomaterial additives can enhance the mechanical, electrical, and other properties for end-use applications. However, the use of nanomaterial inclusions can also enhance the AM processes themselves. Here, we discuss works where nanomaterials are employed as local heaters for fused deposition modeling, as viscosifiers for direct ink writing, and as photothermal sensitizers for selective laser sintering and vat polymerization. We also note the disconnect between the researched AM capabilities and current industrial manufacturing; nanomaterials can bridge the technological gap and lead to new common practices in industrial manufacturing spaces.

The appropriate name for three-dimensional (3D) printing is additive manufacturing because it produces the part layer by layer. Plastics and metals can be 3D printed in large quantities with the precise surface finish and feature quality needed in additive manufacturing. More specifically, direct metal sintering, direct energy deposition, and metal binder jetting are used in 3D printing. The computer-aided design model is completed when the powder bed has been successively scanned and lowered. The metal sintering process uses a powder bed with powder metal, and laser selectively melts a flattened bed of powder, which is done with roller with successive rolling of new layer on previous into desired shape before a new layer is pushed on top of the previous layer. As a result, the new layer has solidified on top of the earlier layer, causing the prior layer to melt back again. Because of the unique thermal cycle, this results in residual stress (RS). The unique thermal cycle of metal additive manufacturing is characterized by (1) rapid heating rate caused by high energy intensity and steep temperature gradients; (2) rapid solidification with high cooling rates because of the small volume of melt pool; and (3) melt back, which involves simultaneous melting of the top powder layer and re-melting of underlying previously solidified layers. The presence of RS in metal additive manufacturing (AM) creates difficulties that restrict the process's ability to produce parts at an industrial scale. During and after manufacturing, these forces may cause parts to distort and crack. This can be solved by heating the powder bed, which will lessen this type of issue. The causes, traits, and reduction of RS are the main topics of this review article. A number of conceptual approaches to reducing RS are addressed to provide some useful inspiration for creating a methodical RS balancing procedure for AM. These approaches are based on the state and future of the relevant techniques.

Countless businesses in automotive, aerospace, medical, and even food industries have adopted this approach over the past decade. Though this revolution has sparked widespread innovation with single material usage, the manufacturing world is constantly evolving. 3D printers now have the capability to create multi-material systems with performance improvements in user-defmable locations. This means throughout a single component, properties like hardness, corrosion resistance, and environmental adaptation can be defined in areas that require it the most. These new processes allow for exciting multifunctional parts to be built that were never possible through traditional, single material AM processes. AM of metals, ceramics, and polymers is currently being evaluated to combine multiple materials in one operation and has already produced never-before-produced parts. While multi-material AM is still in its infancy, researchers are shifting their mindset toward this unique approach showing that the technology is beginning to advance past a research and development stage into real-world applications. This review is intended to highlight the range of 3D printed polymer-based, metal-metal, and metal-ceramic applications while discussing advantages and challenges with additively manufactured multi-material structures.

J	Hertle, S; Kleffel, T; Wörz, A; Drummer, D				Hertle, Sebastian; Kleffel, Tobias; Woerz, Andreas; Drummer, Dietmar			Production of polymer-metal hybrids using extrusion-based additive manufacturing and electrochemically treated aluminum	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Material extrusion; Polymer-metal-hybrid; Surface microstructure; Lap shear strength; Consolidation	ADHESION	The development towards higher individualization and functional density pushes the need towards a flexible production of multi-material and lightweight components. In this paper, extrusion based additive manufacturing was used to produce polymer-metal hybrids with polypropylene and aluminum alloy. For this purpose, a screw-driven extruder on a six-axis robot was used. Due to the adhesion incompatibility of polypropylene and untreated metals, the surface of the aluminum sheets was electrochemically micro-structured. The investigations show that this enables a mechanically stressable joint through the filling of the surface microstructures with polymer. Investigations on lap shear joints reveal a distinct influence of the contact temperature between the polymer and metal onto the lap shear strength. A sufficient contact temperature is required for filling surface microstructures. Thus, increased metal and extrusion temperatures favor higher strengths. Furthermore, the use of a consolidation roll shows beneficial influences in lower temperature ranges due to the application of higher pressures during the polymer strand deposition.

Thermal residual stress is a primary cause of failures such as interlayer disbonds or delamination, micro cracking, and dimensional instability, which can occur during or after the build. This study reports a novel digital image correlation (DIC) adaptation to monitor thermal residual stresses during the entire print process for large-scale AM. In this work, DIC has been investigated (a) by the natural speckle produced by the polymer surface for correlation, (b) to monitor AM build, and (c) to evaluate the effect of thermal residual stress on warpage of the printed component. The natural speckle pattern of the AM material resulted in a respectable 3.57% error compared to the traditional painted speckle pattern of 3.05% error. DIC measured a 190% increase in vertical displacement at the edge of the wall compared to the center, indicating warpage during AM. This work is a step towards a non-intrusive residual stress measuring technique using DIC for large-scale AM.

In the case of conventional machining, where the material is removed by different processes (subtractive manufacturing), there is a possibility of warping and internal stress development. Rapid prototyping is another option to avoid all drawbacks of conventional machining in terms of manufacturing cost, time, accuracy, and quality. Rapid prototyping of a product by adding material (additive manufacturing) is gaining commercial traction. Additive manufacturing is frequently employed for the fabrication and bulk customization of all kinds of intricate geometrical designs that are absurd by traditional manufacturing techniques. Additive manufacturing techniques are broadly divided into four categories: (a) material extrusion, (b) chain polymerization, (c) laser or electron beamassisted sintering, and (d) direct writing-based processes. This article is a cutting-edge review that focuses on additive manufacturing processes and materials used in additive manufacturing. The process parameters for experimentation are chosen based on the application for which the part is designed. Some input process factors influence others for a specific response, and these critical process parameters are identified and optimized. This paper also gives a synopsis of failures associated with some additive manufacturing methods and their preventive actions.

Polymer-Based Additive Manufacturing: Historical Developments, Process Types and Material Considerations	POLYMER-BASED ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING: BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Book Chapter						3D printing; Polymers; Stereolithography; Fused filament fabrication; Selective laser sintering; PolyJet; InkJet; Freeformer; Laminated object manufacturing	MECHANICAL CHARACTERIZATION; DRUG-DELIVERY; 3D; PLA; STEREOLITHOGRAPHY; PERFORMANCE; INTERFACE; RELEASE; IMPACT	3D printing is a manufacturing technique where parts are built in a layer-by--layer fashion. The earliest embodiments were based on generating successive layers of solidified materials at the air liquid interface through exposure with actinic radiation and the lowering of the growing object into a vat of photoactive material. One of the earliest concepts was by Otto Munz in 1956 where he describes "photo-glyph recording". However, many today consider Charles Hull the father of 3D printing as it was his patent that coined the term "stereolithography" and was the first to commercialize a 3D printing apparatus. Since then, there has being a multitude of technologies developed which fall into the category of 3D printing. While photochemical resin curing remains one of the most widely utilised 3D printing techniques, other techniques based on the extrusion of polymers, cutting sheets or films and thermally or chemically binding powdered materials have all reached the commercial markets. This chapter aims to give an outline of the most common polymer-based 3D printing techniques available today and describes some of the material and processing constraints which should be considered when selecting these systems for 3D printing of biomedical parts.

Additive manufacturing of conductive polymer hydrogels with favorable conductivity and biocompatibility can offer new opportunities for EMI-shielding applications. However, simultaneously achieving high conductivity, design freedom, and shape fidelity in 3D printing of conductive polymer hydrogels is still very challenging. Here, an aqueous Ti3C2-MXene-functionalized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate ink is developed for extrusion printing to create 3D objects with arbitrary geometries, and a freeze-thawing protocol is proposed to transform the printed objects directly into highly conductive and robust hydrogels with high shape fidelity on both the macro- and microscale. The as-obtained hydrogel exhibits a high conductivity of 1525.8 S m(-1) at water content up to 96.6 wt% and also satisfactory mechanical properties with flexibility, stretchability, and fatigue resistance. Furthermore, the use of the printed hydrogel for customizable EMI-shielding applications is demonstrated. The proposed easy-to-manufacture approach, along with the highlighted superior properties, expands the potential of conductive polymer hydrogels in future customizable applications and represents a real breakthrough from the current state of the art.

In this work, we study the effect of two process parameters, including build orientation (XYZ, XZY, and ZXY) and raster pattern ( +/- 45 degrees and 0 degrees/90 degrees), on the fracture behavior of the CFRP composites fabricated by fused filament fabrication (FFF). The mode I fracture toughness and effective fracture energy of the CFRP composite materials are measured on compact tension samples. The crack growth direction in the FFF-fabricated CFRP composites is found to be controlled by both build orientation and raster pattern. The fracture toughness of the examined CFRP material is sensitive to build orientation, while the effective fracture energy reveals significant dependence on both build orientation and raster pattern. The samples fabricated with the XYZ and ZXY build orientations exhibit 5-fold greater effective fracture energy than the ones with the XZY build orientation. A wide range of fracture energy dissipation mechanisms, including fiber-bridging and fiber pull-out, are identified depending on the process parameters. The reported fracture trends in this study have the potential to provide guidelines for the development of FFFfabricated CFRP composites with high fracture resistance.

In this case, the factors to be optimized included minimizing the support material, and post-processing required to make the part, as well as minimizing the products' weight and print time. Improvement in product functionality would also be a desirable outcome of the project. The paper also compares the new and old manifold in terms of material usage, weight, costs, Manhattan distances, and residual stress. The DfAM process used in this article includes the steps of removing all material that doesn't serve a specific engineering function, exploring the effects of different print orientations, techniques for eliminating support material and post-processing.

SMP behavior is often impacted by manufacturing features like layering that can impart anisotropic responses. Volumetric additive manufacturing (VAM) is an emerging paradigm that can generate complex three-dimensional SMP structures without layers.

Recently, it has attracted considerable attention, as this technique offers manifold benefits over conventional manufacturing technologies. However, to meet the challenges of complex industrial applications, certain shortcomings of ME-AM still need to be overcome. A case in point is the limited amount of semicrystalline thermoplastics, which are still not established as reliable, commercial filament materials. Particularly, polypropylene (PP) offers attractive properties that are unique among the ME-AM material portfolio. This review describes the current approaches of fabricating PP components by ME-AM. Both commercial and scientific strategies to make PP 3D-printable are elaborated and compared. As dimensional issues are especially problematic for PP, a comprehensive section of this review focuses on the strategies developed for mitigating warpage for PP parts fabricated by ME-AM.

Additive manufacturing of flexible electrically conductive polymer composites via CNC-assisted fused layer modeling process	JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN SOCIETY OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Elastomers; Ethylene vinyl acetate; Graphite; Additive manufacturing; Fused deposition modeling; Pellets; Flexible electrically conductive composites; Flexible conductive polymers	MATRIX COMPOSITES; GRAPHITE	The applications of electrically flexible conductive polymer composites are rapidly growing over the time due to their widespread use in fabrication of health monitoring devices, sensors, and flexible displays fabrication, etc. Various techniques have been explored to develop electrically conductive polymer composites. In the recent past, fused deposition modeling (FDM) process has been gained tremendous attention to fabricate electrically conductive parts considering rigid polymers along with conductive filler particles. This allows to avail all advantages and benefits of additive manufacturing in the fabrication of complex electrically conductive parts. However, FDM process faces challenges of filament buckling while fabricating flexible parts. Hence, there is need to develop an economically viable and simplified process to fabricate the flexible electrically conductive polymer composite objects. In the present study, fabrication of flexible electrically conductive polymer composite objects has been attempted by developing a novel CNC assisted fused layer modeling process. The developed process uses the material in pellet form instead of a filament, which eliminates the issues of filament buckling and allows flexible object fabrication. The ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and graphite (Gr) particles have been used as the polymer matrix and conductive filler material respectively. Solvent and melt blending techniques have been employed to develop EVA/Gr composites. Three-dimensional flexible electrically conductive objects have been fabricated successfully. The experimental result shows the remarkable improvements in electrical conductivity of EVA polymer by incorporation of graphite particles. The outcome of the presented approach may help to fabricate flexible electrically conductive complex structures for soft robotics and electronics applications.

However, key challenges remain for highly filled composite filaments: (a) filament brittleness, (b) nozzle clogging, (c) rough surface finish, and (d) inconsistent mechanical performance due to shear -induced filler migration, agglomeration, and interference of interdiffusion with the polymer chain. In this study, we demonstrate that a highly filled core-shell dual-layer (DL) filament, with an acrylonitrile-butadiene- styrene (ABS)/calcium carbonate (CaCO3) composite core and a virgin ABS shell, is a feasible solution to overcome the limitations and maximize the advantages of composite filaments. First, we designed a coextrusion die with the two-dimensional (2D) finite element method (FEM) flow simulation to minimize interfacial flow instabilities and predict the interfacial position. The simulated interface agrees well with the experimentally measured values. Using the designed die, the highly filled core-shell DL filaments of up to approximately 30 wt % (12 vol %) were fabricated with precise diameters and adequate deviations. The parts printed using the filaments can enhance the tensile strength (22.3 MPa), anisotropy (32% deviation with respect to print directions), and visual gloss in comparison with an equivalent highly filled monolayer (ML) filament (15.3 MPa tensile strength and 80% anisotropy) under the same printing conditions. The fractured surface and cross-sectional optical view of the printed parts of DLand ML filaments elucidated the structural and rheological benefits of DL filaments in terms of interlaminar bond formation.

Both the interface orientation and the interface strength are varied during the processing. Prior to tensile experiments, X-ray micro-tomography imaging is undertaken to obtain the microstructural arrangement of polymer droplets in the part. Tensile loading is performed simultaneously with digital image acquisition to reveal the extent of strain localization using a digital image correlation approach. The experiments are performed up to the failure of the specimens. Finite element computation based on 3D imaging of the ABS/TPU composite is considered to predict the role of the interface as well as the defect influence on the tensile performance. The experimental results show a major connectivity of the process-generated porosity and a distinct morphology of the ABS/TPU interface. The predictions demonstrate that, despite the limited amount of porosity, their connectivity plays a significant role in triggering damage initiation and growth up to the failure of the composite material.

However, traditional metal implants have many adverse effects due to their poor integration with host tissues, and therefore new material implants with porous structures are gradually being developed that are suitable for clinical medical applications. From the perspectives of additive manufacturing technology and materials, this article discusses a suitable manufacturing process for ideal materials for biological bone tissue engineering. It begins with a review of the methods and applicable materials in existing additive manufacturing technologies and their applications in biomedicine, introducing the advantages and disadvantages of various AM technologies. The properties of materials including metals and polymers, commonly used AM technologies, recent developments, and their applications in bone tissue engineering are discussed in detail and summarized. In addition, the main challenges for different metallic and polymer materials, such as biodegradability, anisotropy, growth factors to promote the osteogenic capacity, and enhancement of mechanical properties are also introduced.

The extrusion-based additive manufacturing (EAM) of polymers has also become one of the main processing methods for thermoplastic parts. In this paper, a hybrid manufacturing method for the FSW process and EAM technology is proposed and explored. The effects of the FSW process using two different welding tools on the mechanical behaviors of 3D printing polymer parts were compared and investigated and the corresponding mechanism was analyzed. The results show that the appropriate welding tool is beneficial for eliminating the anisotropy and decreasing the porosity of 3D-printed parts. Therefore, the improving effects of the FSW process on the mechanical behaviors of the EAM parts are verified. The mechanism was attributed to the high-speed rotation of the welding tool with the appropriate shape, which can promote the flow of polymer melt in the welding region, leading to the formation of dense structures caused by the entanglement of the molecular chains. This study may provide some assistance in modern industrial manufacturing for the processing of large custom components.

A processing concept was developed in previous studies, which targets the implementation of reactive liquids in a thermoplastic powder-bed for the creation of multimaterial polymer composite parts. This process aims to be the first AM process of its kind to fully utilize the potentials of both thermoplastic and thermoset polymers simultaneously. A highly important aspect for this process is the investigation of the infiltration behavior of the reactive liquids within the powder bed, since premature or delayed curing of the liquids could lead to deviations from the intended geometry as well as process errors due to material protrusions. This investigation presents an experimental and a mathematical approach to describe and predict the time which a droplet needs to completely infiltrate the powder bed. The results showed, that the experimental setup is viable to observe the droplet height over time at temperatures of up to 105 degrees C and infiltration times below 500 ms. The mathematical model proved to be a powerful approximation to describe the infiltration behavior of a reactive liquid within a thermoplastic powder bed once a material-specific form factor is determined for each powder material. Through the process of elimination, the independence of the form factor was demonstrated for different powder parameters like the particle size. A theory is presented, which correlates the form factor to the microstructural shape and surface condition of the particles based on SEM images.

The optimization of multi-material parts relies on accurate forward prediction, which is challenging to achieve owing to the complex processing conditions in additive manufacturing and the resultant uncertainties in material properties. To address these limitations, here we present a new model calibration and model selection framework based on the high dimensional, local-scale deformation data. By matching the pixel-level deformation data from digital image correlation experiments and constitutive modeling, the presented framework enables more accurate prediction and significant reduction of the prediction uncertainties, as compared to the single material calibration approach that is widely used in additive manufacturing. In turn, this enables quantitative comparison of the candidate models, so the most accurate and computationally efficient constitutive model can be selected for forward prediction in heterogeneous material design. The advantages of the framework are demonstrated using a multi-polymer system manufactured by dual-extrusion additive manufacturing, which consists of two constituent materials with dramatically different deformation behaviors.

Polyphthalocyanine coatings for corrosion protection on additive manufactured steel materials	PROGRESS IN ORGANIC COATINGS			English	Article						Polyphthalocyanine; Thermal polymerization; Corrosion protection; Additive manufactured 316L steel; Potentiodynamic polarization; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy	STAINLESS-STEEL; MILD-STEEL; POLYMERIC PHTHALOCYANINES; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; X-RAY; IRON; COPPER; METAL; XPS	Polyphthalocyanine polymer films are deposited on additive manufactured (AM) 316L steel samples for corrosion protection. Coatings were deposited on the metallic surface using a drop casting method and then set via thermal polymerization of tetracyanobenzene to produce polyphthalocyanine. The formation of the polymer film on the metal surface was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The coated AM steel had a more positive corrosion potential compared to the uncoated sample indicating improved corrosion protection. XPS studies probed the bonding properties between the coating and additive manufactured metal surface. Potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies confirm the corrosion protection ability of the polyphthalocyanine films on AM samples in 3.5 wt% NaCl medium.

For example, shaping the beam profile and footprint holds great potential for beam delivery in laser-assisted manufacturing processes. In particular, top hat beam profiles of different shapes and size would enable speeding up additive manufacturing while increasing the resolution of the 3D printed parts. In this paper, we present the design of different beam shapers for high power CO2 lasers used in laser sintering, which are able to generate respectively square and circular top hat beam profiles. The size of the spot is controlled by using additional lenses to reduce or enlarge the beam size as necessary after the beam shaping optics. A spot size of 0.5 mm or 5 mm diameter can be achieved by switching between different lenses and adjust the distances accordingly. The designed beam shaping optics were subsequently fabricated in-house using ultra-precision diamond tooling in zinc sulfide material which is tolerant to high laser power and transparent at a wavelength of 10.6 mu m. This beam shaping optics can form the basis for dynamic beam shaping in which the spot size, spot shape and/or intensity profile can be actively controlled by moving the optical components in the laser beam path.

Many technologies introduce temperature-dependent curing and decomposition behavior of acrylates to the list of process-related challenges. This investigation targets a comprehensive analysis of the curing behavior and thermal stability of acrylic photopolymers by implementing analyzing techniques like thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. Significant parameters such as the UV intensity and the isothermal temperature are varied based on the design of experiments. Characteristic evolving gases at elevated temperatures are identified and discussed towards their relevance for the curing process. The calorimetric results demonstrate increasing reaction speeds with elevated UV intensities as well as a restricted accelerating effect of increasing temperatures. The reaction enthalpy proves to be strongly dependent on the chosen temperature. The results represent the base for the comparison of different kinetic curing models in future investigations.

AM methods can be applied for creating elements from polymers without and with reinforcing fibers. During the process, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors can be embedded into the element structure for the purpose of structural health monitoring (SHM) system development. Such an approach combines in one, advantages of AM (limited waste, elements with complex shape) and SHM system (safety, information about real loading conditions). Such a method can be applied for the manufacturing of different elements applied in many branches of industry, e.g. marine or civil engineering. The goal of the paper is to analyze the possibility of FBG sensors embedding into an AM polymeric elements without and with carbon fiber reinforcement. The analyzes are focused on the influence of the manufacturing process on FBG sensors (both spectrum and strain). Additionally, the influence of temperature (both elevated and sub-zero) on the finished AM elements was be investigated.

The processes have been optimized to improve mechanical performance of the manufactured parts. Nevertheless, properties of components made by means of injection molding could not be reached yet. In the study at hand, ultrasonic phase spectroscopy (UPS) is used to compare the elastic properties of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene specimens manufactured by injection molding, by fused filament fabrication, and the Arburg plastic freeforming process. UPS allows a nondestructive and prompt determination of the elastic modulus and allows evaluation of the mechanical properties in every direction in space. In the end, results of UPS are compared with properties derived by uniaxial tensile tests to validate UPS as a test method for the determination of the mechanical properties of polymers. Regardless of the manufacturing process, an approximately linear dependence of the elastic moduli on the density can be determined. Furthermore, the quasistatic properties of the injection molded samples consistently exhibit the mechanical properties of the other samples by at least 10%.

Unfortunately, large-scale 2D nano additive manufacturing via TPL remains challenging due to the lack of suitable solid two-photon photoresists (TPPs). Although some commercial solid UV photoresists have been reported for TPL application, their slow two-photon adsorption results in insufficient sensitivity and unsatisfactory critical dimension (CD). More importantly, commercial photoresists are compli-cated to synthesize, difficult to biodegrade, and will pose a pollution risk to environment. In this work, cellulose derivative, a natural bio-polymer, is introduced to form a biodegradable solid TPP (Cel-STPP-x) for TPL. The preeminent photo-sensitivity and two-color photo-sensitivity allow Cel-STPP-x to have a considerable writing speed (2.43 m s_ 1) and a remarkable CD (42 nm), which are superior to the majority of reported TPPs. Subse-quently, a 1-inch silica-based grating is created through TPL, etching, and stripping, indicating that Cel-STPP-x may be employed not only for large-scale nano additive manufacturing but also for pattern transfer, which is critical for producing diverse micro devices. Besides, the used Cel-STPP-x can be rapidly decomposed in soil. Overall, this work may pave the way for TPL towards sustainable and large-scale 2D nano additive manufacturing.

J	Villacres, J; Nobes, D; Ayranci, C				Villacres, Jorge; Nobes, David; Ayranci, Cagri			Additive manufacturing of shape memory polymers: effects of print orientation and infill percentage on shape memory recovery properties	RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL			English	Article						Fused deposition modeling; Additive manufacturing; Smart materials; Shape memory polymers; Material extrusion additive manufacturing; Shape memory properties		Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the shape memory properties of SMP samples produced through a MEAM process. Fused deposition modeling or, as it will be referred to in this paper, material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEAM) is a technique in which polymeric materials are extruded though a nozzle creating parts via accumulation and joining of different layers. These layers are fused together to build three-dimensional objects. Shape memory polymers (SMP) are stimulus responsive materials, which have the ability to recover their pre-programmed form after being exposed to a large strain. To induce its shape memory recovery movement, an external stimulus such as heat needs to be applied. Design/methodology/approach This project investigates and characterizes the influence of print orientation and infill percentage on shape recovery properties. The analyzed shape recovery properties are shape recovery force, shape recovery speed and time elapsed before activation. To determine whether the analyzed factors produce a significant variation on shape recovery properties,t-tests were performed with a 95% confidence factor between each analyzed level. Findings Results proved that print angle and infill percentage do have a significant impact on recovery properties of the manufactured specimens. Originality/value The manufacturing of SMP objects through a MEAM process has a vast potential for different applications; however, the shape recovery properties of these objects need to be analyzed before any practical use can be developed. These have not been studied as a function of print parameters, which is the focus of this study.

The process requires no preliminary synthesis of parent glass, and the polymer route enables the application of direct ink writing (DIW) of silicone-based mixtures, for the manufacturing of reticulated scaffolds at room temperature. The thermal treatment is later applied for the conversion into ceramic scaffolds. The present paper further elucidates the flexibility of the approach. Changes in the reference silicone and firing atmosphere (from air to nitrogen) were studied to obtain functional composite biomaterials featuring a carbon phase embedded in a Biosilicate (R)-like matrix. The microstructure was further modified either through a controlled gas release at a low temperature, or by the revision of the adopted additive manufacturing technology (from DIW to digital light processing).

J	Nagaraj, MH; Maiaru, M				Nagaraj, Manish H.; Maiaru, Marianna			A novel higher-order finite element framework for the process modeling of material extrusion additive manufacturing	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Material extrusion additive manufacturing; Thermal modeling; Higher-order finite elements	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; HEAT-TRANSFER; PARAMETERS	Material extrusion additive manufacturing enables the rapid fabrication of complex structures for a wide range of applications, including within the aerospace and healthcare sectors. Optimizing the performance of additively manufactured polymer structures depends on the ability to predict residual stress induced by the sequential solidification of the extruded layers. Self-equilibrated residual stresses are influenced by the thermal history of the part during the manufacturing process. This work introduces a novel numerical framework for the process modeling of material extrusion additive manufacturing. The numerical modeling is based on higher -order finite elements derived from the Carrera Unified Formulation (CUF), which enables accurate prediction of the stress field while reducing the associated computational overheads. Element activation is adopted to model the evolving structure during material extrusion and deposition. Heat exchange mechanisms such as conduction (filament/filament, filament/build platform), convection, and radiation are included in the model. A transient thermal analysis is performed in this new framework to predict the temperature distribution within the part during its fabrication. Multiple numerical assessments are presented for the material extrusion additive manufacturing of parts ranging in size from 30 mm to over 1500 mm. The predicted thermal profiles are in excellent agreement with reference experimental observations, thereby validating the proposed numerical framework and demonstrating its capability to model the printing process accurately. Results from this work are a milestone toward optimizing additively manufactured polymer parts.

Despite that, the use of bio-based composites for improved mechanical properties and biodegradation is still not fully explored. This limits the universal expansion of AM-fabricated products due to the incompatibility of the products made from petroleum-derived resources. The development of naturally-derived polymers for AM materials is promising with the increasing number of studies in recent years owing to their biodegradation and biocompatibility. Cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer that possesses many favorable properties to be incorporated into AM materials, which have been continuously focused on in recent years. This critical review discusses the development of AM technologies and materials, cellulose-based polymers, cellulose-based three-dimensional (3D) printing filaments, liquid deposition modeling of cellulose, and four-dimensional (4D) printing of cellulose-based materials. Cellulose-based AM material applications and the limitations with future developments are also reviewed.

However, before the applica-tions are realized and industrially adopted, further research and development regarding MP-incorporated AM feedstock availability, production scale-up, and processability and printability is needed. The goal of this review is to bridge the gap between the bench top and real world applications of AM of MPs by identifying high impact application spaces and highlighting the challenges that need to be overcome for widespread adoption. Here, the state-of-the-art of AM of MP-incorporated feedstocks is reviewed, followed by a discussion of potential future applications, current challenges, and research areas that work toward commercialization of AM of MP -incorporated feedstocks.

This technology transformed traditional processing design and manufacturing concepts and promoted the development of intelligent manufacturing. Intelligent material is a kind of material that has the ability of self-perception, autonomous response, self-healing and adaptation. The combination of intelligent materials and additive manufacturing technology can realize the integrated manufacturing of three-dimensional smart devices with the ability to sense external stimuli or environmental activation. This technology has been widely used in fields such as biomedical devices, flexible electronics, soft robotics, and other fields. Additive manufactured intelligent materials, and the advantages and problems of additive manufactured intelligent materials of metals, polymers, and ceramics were reviewed. As a technical means to realize the organic integration of design, material and structure, additive manufacturing technology will become the key to promote the development of intelligent materials.

By producing large components without geometrical constraints quickly and economically, LSAM processes have the capability to revolutionize many industries. Accurate prediction and control of the thermal history is key for a successful manufacturing process and for achieving high quality and good mechanical properties of the manufactured part. During the LSAM process, the heat emitted by the nozzle leads to an increase in the temperature of the previously deposited layer, which prepares the surface for better adhesion of the new layer. It is therefore necessary to take into account this part of heat source in the transient heat transfer equation to correctly and completely describe the process and predict the temperature field of the manufactured part. The present study contributes to experimental investigations and numerical analysis during the LSAM process. During the process, two types of measurements are performed: firstly, the heat emitted by the nozzle is measured via a radiative heat sensor; secondly, the temperature field is measured using an infrared camera while varying the process speed. At the same time, a numerical simulation model is developed in order to validate the experimental results. The temperature fields of the manufactured parts computed by numerical simulations are in very good agreement with the temperature fields measured by infrared thermograph with the contribution of the nozzle's heat exchange.

Especially in terms of manufacturing, new technologies promise a variety of new opportunities. 3D printing processes are able to deposit functional materials on additive manufactured surfaces with simultaneously low material consumption. Furthermore, this may be implemented in conventional 3D printing to achieve a functional process. With this technology it is for example possible to manufacture a fully additive manufactured illumination system, based on polymer OLEDs. We use solvable functional inks for each semiconductor layer, which are ready to use in inkjet printing systems. Here we present the transfer from commonly used anorganic ITO (indium tin oxide) to an inkjet printed, transparent anode on an additive manufactured resin substrate. In addition, we discuss the 3D printing technologies involved in the manufacturing process as well as the geometrical layer design and contacting methods used. Challenges here by are the surface quality and wetting properties of the substrate surface and each individual layer. We evaluate our results by the electrical and optical characteristics. Additionally we discuss manufacturing parameters and their effect on the device functionality.

Tuning the material properties of a water-soluble ionic polymer using different counterions for material extrusion additive manufacturing	POLYMER			English	Article						Material extrusion; Fused filament fabrication (FFF); Fused deposition modeling (FDM); Additive manufacturing; 3D printing; Pharmaceutical; Semi-crystalline polymer; Ionic polymer; Water-soluble	POLYETHYLENE-GLYCOL; PROCESSING CONDITIONS; DRUG-DELIVERY; 3D; TABLETS; STABILITY	Additive manufacturing (AM) affords the opportunity to print tailored pharmaceuticals to customize the quantity of medicine, number of medicines, and time and rate of release to be adapted for an individual's needs. A series of sulfonated poly(ethylene glycol) (SPEG) polymers for fused filament fabrication (FFF) that (i) dissolves quickly ( < 3.0 mg/min) and (ii) can be printed at a low temperature of 70 degrees C, thus enabling the incorporation of active ingredients have previously been reported. In this work, the effect of incorporating different counterions into the SPEG polymer on printability was investigated. Material properties were measured and feature specimens were printed to qualitatively analyze the effects of the material properties on the printability of the polymers containing each counterion. The SPEG containing Ca2+ counterions permitted the fabrication of the most accurate printed parts without warping, with defined roads, and the ability to cross a gap which all result from a high viscosity, low volumetric shrinkage, and < 10 mu m crystal size. This work demonstrates the ability to tune the molecular structure of an ionic polymer by changing the counterion to create a novel and functional polymer for FFF.

Recently, O&P service providers have started exploring different advanced manufacturing techniques. The objective of this paper is to perform a mini review on recent progress in the use of polymer-based additive manufacturing (AM) for O&P devices and to gather insights from the O&P professionals on the current practices and technologies and on the prospect of using AM techniques in this field. In our study, first, scientific articles on AM for O&P devices were studied. Then, twenty-two (22) interviews were conducted with O&P professionals from Canada. The primary focus was on five key areas: cost, material, design and fabrication efficiency, structural strength, functionality, and patient satisfaction. The cost of manufacturing the O&P devices using AM techniques is lower as compared to the conventional methods. O&P professionals expressed their concern over the materials and structural strength of the 3D-printed prosthetic devices. Published articles report comparable functionality and patient satisfaction for both O&P devices. AM also greatly improves design and fabrication efficiency. However, due to a lack of qualification standards for 3D printed O&P devices, 3D printing is being embraced more slowly in the O&P business than in other industries.

In this work, a thiol-ene-based system incorporating semicrystallinity and dynamic thioester bonds within polymer networks is presented. It is shown that these materials have ultimate toughness values >16 MJ cm(-3), comparable to high-performance literature precedents. Significantly, the treatment of these networks with excess thiols facilitates thiol-thioester exchange that degrades polymerized networks into functional oligomers. These oligomers are shown to be amenable to repolymerization into constructs with varying thermomechanical properties, including elastomeric networks that recover their shape fully from >100% strain. Using a commercial stereolithographic printer, these resin formulations are printed into functional objects including both stiff (E similar to 10-100 MPa) and soft (E similar to 1-10 MPa) lattice structures. Finally, it is shown that the incorporation of both dynamic chemistry and crystallinity further enables advancement in the properties and characteristics of printed parts, including attributes such as self-healing and shape-memory.

Fabrication of bulk polymer derived ceramics is challenging due to gas evolution during crosslinking leading to pores and cracks in final product. Mixture of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was successfully used to generate open porosity before crosslinking step. For 3D printing, a pellet extruder was used and a PVA binder content of 50 vol% was essential for succcessful solvent debinding process in water. The effect of PVA content and different EVA grades on printability and debinding behavior was studied. EVA with a lower melt flow index (MFI) showed better compatibility with PVA additive in terms of mixing and printing. EVA with higher vinyl acetate content seems to be more favorable for later thermal debinding processes because of its higher gas permeability.

This is in alignment with major trends in sustainability in today's world where a reduction in the usage of fossil fuels and other fossil fuel-dependent technologies is being realized. Additive Manufacturing technologies that have in the past been driven by the automotive industry, now present an opportunity for the automotive sector, where greater gains and benefits can be made by its adoption. Additively manufactured parts enable complex optimized design and also promote material efficiency.

Flow Characteristics of a Thermoset Fiber Composite Photopolymer Resin in a Vat Polymerization Additive Manufacturing Process	PROCEEDINGS OF PPS-34: THE 34TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE POLYMER PROCESSING SOCIETY - CONFERENCE PAPERS	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	34th International Conference of the Polymer-Processing-Society (PPS)	MAY 21-25, 2018	Taipei, TAIWAN	Polymer Proc Soc, Chang Gung Univ		Additive Manufacturing; Vat Polymerization; Thermoset; Photopolymer; Simulation	REINFORCED POLYMERS; ORIENTATION	Additive manufacturing vat polymerization has become a leading technology and gained a massive amount of attention in industrial applications such as injection molding inserts. By the use of the thermoset polymerization process inserts have increased their market share. For most industrial applications, strength and stiffness are crucial factors to a successful implementation of cured photopolymer thermosets. Hence, fiber-reinforced polymers have recently been introduced. The behavior and especially orientation of fibers during the vat photopolymerization process has yet not been fully understood. Research indicates an orientation within the manufacturing layer and efforts have been made to achieve a more uniform orientation within the part. A vat polymerization machine consisting of a resin vat and a moving build plate has been simulated using the fluid flow module of Comsol Multiphysics (TM). A moving mesh with hyper-elastic behavior was utilized to simulate the flow of the photopolymer during the lifting of the build plate after a successful curing of a single layer. The velocity profile can thereafter be used to estimate a prediction for the orientation of the short fibers added to the liquid photopolymer resin. The prediction can be used to identify potential clusters or misalignment of fibers and in the future allow for optimization of the machine design and manufacturing process.

They may become part of the polymer network (like initiators do) or remain without a chemical linkage to the polymer. Additives aid in the processing of the polymer and in the manufacture of the plastic end product (lubricants, plasticizers) or improve characteristics and performance of the final product (flame retardants, antistatic agents, impact modifiers, and heat/light stabilizers). Additive manufacturers are faced with the imperative to develop products that not only enhance the overall processability and functionality of the plastic end products, but to satisfy environmental and health demands as well. Additives are regulated by national or international authorities in order to protect consumers, when leaching or extraction from elastomeric or plastic components or from a coating film occurs or when volatilization into the environment may happen.

In this work, a novel manufacturing method is introduced for thermoresponsive quick response (QR) code carriers, which originally were developed as anticounterfeiting technology. Motivated by the fact that earlier manufacturing processes were sometimes too time-consuming for production, filaments of a polyester urethane (PEU) with and without dye were extruded and processed into QR code carriers using fused filament fabrication (FFF). Once programmed, the distinct shape memory properties enabled a heating-initiated switching from non-decodable to machine-readable QR codes. The results demonstrate that FFF constitutes a promising additive manufacturing technology to create complex, filigree structures with adjustable horizontal and vertical print resolution and, thus, an excellent basis to realize further technically demanding application concepts for shape memory polymers.

Sol-gel method was used for the synthesis of the bioactive glass. For ink preparation, Pluronic F-127 was used as an ink carrier. The CNT-reinforced scaffolds were coated with the polymer polycaprolactone (PCL) using dip-coating method to improve their properties further by sealing the micro-cracks. The CNT- reinforcement and polymer coating resulted in an improvement in the compressive strength of the additively manufactured scaffolds by 98% in comparison to pure bioactive glass scaffolds. Further, the morphological analysis revealed interconnected pores and their size appropriate for osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Evaluation of the in vitro bioactivity of the scaffolds after immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF) confirmed the formation of hydroxyapatite (HA). Further, the cellular studies showed good cell viability and initiation of osteogensis. These results demonstrate the potential of these scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications.

Current understanding and challenges in high temperature additive manufacturing of engineering thermoplastic polymers	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Review						3D printing; Material extrusion; Powder bed fusion; Thermoplastic processing; High temperature engineering thermoplastics	FUSED FILAMENT FABRICATION; ETHER KETONE PEEK; CARBON-FIBER CF; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; RHEOLOGICAL BEHAVIOR; POLY(PHENYLENE SULFIDE); SINTERING REGION; LASER; POWDER; COMPOSITES	The strengths of additive manufacturing (AM), especially the tool-less manufacturing paradigm and rapid pro-duction of low-volume products, are well-aligned with the needs of manufacturing of expensive, high-tem-perature resistant, engineering thermoplastic polymers. High temperature polymer parts made with AM for either tooling or end-use applications have been implemented in the aerospace, automotive, and biomedical fields. However, parts made from these polymers using traditional manufacturing processes are generally high-value parts in low-quantity production runs. Moreover, AM processing of these polymers present significant challenges due to limitations associated with large thermal gradients, residual stress buildup, and interlayer adhesion as well as the inability of the printers to consistently maintain required high processing temperatures. This review highlights the current state of the art for processing high-temperature (i.e., traditional processing temperatures exceeding 250 degrees C) thermoplastic polymers by the melt-based, AM processes of material extrusion (MatEx) and laser powder bed fusion (PBF). The authors address common challenges to AM of high-temperature polymers and gaps in fundamental understanding of the process-structure-property relationships needed to identify the machine design, process parameter selection, and synthetic modifications to enable processing.

With the evolution of technology, there has been an increasing demand for customized products, which has intensified the need for alternative manufacturing techniques. Additive manufacturing (AM) consists in the development of physical models through the deposition of layer-by-layer material from three-dimensional virtual models. About three decades ago, Fusion Deposition Modeling (FDM) technology was developed. FDM is an AM material extrusion technology, in which the material used is extruded by a nozzle. FDM has been growing, as well as the equipment and software involved, to broad applications in the field of biomedical engineering, such as the development of personalized and functional medical devices (including stents). This study presents the state of the art of 3D printing and additive manufacturing, as well as their techniques, obstacles and innovations. In addition, a stent was developed through a CAD software and it was manufactured through a 3D FDM printer using PLA.	[Athayde Malafaya, B.; Marques, C.; Ferreira, I. A.; Machado, M. M.

Additive Manufacturing with Ultraviolet Curable Silicones Containing Carbon Black	3D PRINTING AND ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						additive manufacturing; 3D printing; silicone; UV; material extrusion; polymer	FABRICATION; STRAIN; TIME	Additive manufacturing techniques for ultraviolet (UV) curable silicones are investigated using a high-pressure extrusion apparatus. Manufacturing challenges encountered include the silicone slumping under its own weight, electrostatic repulsion between the printed part and the extrudate, clogging due to in-nozzle UV curing, and nozzle material accumulation. One of the silicones tested significantly slumped under its own weight and had a height decrease of 25% over 60 s if not in situ cured. Repulsion effects were observed due to tribocharging of the silicone and the UV curing process. Carbon black (CB) was added to the silicone to minimize repulsion effects, alleviate in-nozzle curing, and nozzle material accumulation. Durometer and tensile testing were used to compare mechanical properties of the silicone under different CB loading conditions. Higher loadings of CB abated repulsion effects and also significantly reduced the durometer and 100% secant modulus of elasticity of ASTM D638 Type 1 dogbone printed parts due to inhibition of UV curing depth. Postoven curing of samples increased the durometer and modulus of all samples tested. It was found that 0.15 wt% CB was optimal to reduce repulsion effects and to maintain durometer and secant modulus within -2.6% and -1.3% of bulk cast properties, respectively.

Materials having an explicit response to external stimuli over a certain time span are designated as smart materials and additive manufacturing of such time-dependent, programmable, and intelligent materials is termed as 4D printing. In 4D printing, primary 3D printed configuration switched exclusively into a transformed shape when exposed to an external stimuli, e.g. heat, light, water, chemical, electric current, magnetic field or pH. Perhaps, additive manufacturing technology seems to be superseded exclusively by this modern technology in forthcoming years, and much effort is demanding from every discipline to actualize this technology. A task-oriented entire landscape of 4D printing followed by a comprehensive smart material perspective is presented in this review. Graphical abstract set forth a route to the complete process comprehension. Moreover, other components of 4D technology like customary techniques, computational challenges, reversibility and current stature of 4D printing are probed through recent experimental and theoretical literature. Finally, potential applications of 4D printing are summarised with promising research directions and outlook. Graphic 4D printing: A future insight in additive manufacturing.

Vat polymerization is a type of additive manufacturing technique that offers an attractive strategy for fabricating 3D objects due to its high resolution, versatility of feedstock materials, and high dimensional accuracy. However, the ability to spatially control the placement of multiple materials during vat polymerization is limited by mechanical designs that can restrict printing to a single photocurable resin, making it difficult to create complex geometries with embedded functionality. In this review, we highlight work-arounds that have been employed, such as manually switching resins, as well as two key areas of innovation: mechanical hardware design and the chemistry of materials. These methods include systems which automatically switch resin vats, volumetric additive manufacturing which overprints a secondary 3D structure on top of an existing object, and specially formulated, unique material chemistries, such as those which enable dual wavelength light to initiate orthogonal chemistry mechanisms, control of the degree of cross-linking with variation in light parameters, and phase separation of functional materials. Perspectives on the interplay of printer type and material chemistry, the constraints they impose on one another, and the future of multimaterial vat polymerization are described. In order for vat polymerization to emerge as a viable technology for multimaterial additive manufacturing, both mechanical hardware design and chemistry of materials must be codeveloped.

This review is aimed at summarizing and assessing current advances in wet-spinning of biomedical polymers to manufacture single fibres and three-dimensional scaffolds, as well as their functionalization through loading with bioactive agents. The theoretical principles and the main technological aspects of fibre production by wet-spinning on either a laboratory or an industrial scale are outlined. The non-solvent-induced phase inversion determining polymer coagulation during the wet-spinning process is discussed by highlighting its influence on the resulting fibre morphology and how it can be exploited to induce a nano/microporosity in the solidified polymeric matrix. The versatility of wet-spinning in material selection, bioactive agent loading and fibre morphology tuning is underlined through an overview of significant literature reporting on the processing of various naturally derived and synthetic polymers. A special focus is given to cutting-edge advancements in the application of additive manufacturing principles to wet-spinning for enhanced control and reproducibility of three-dimensional polymeric scaffold morphology at different scale levels (i.e. macrostructural to micro/nanostructural features).

Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, was originally referred to as rapid prototyping manufacturing. Variable-feature rapid prototyping technology, also known as 4D printing, is a combination of materials, mathematics, and additives. This study constitutes a literature review to address hydrogel-based additive manufacturing technologies, introducing the characteristics of commonly used 3D printing hydrogel methods, such as direct ink writing, fused deposition modeling, and stereolithography. With this review, we also investigated the stimulus types, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of various stimulus-responsive hydrogels in smart hydrogels; non-responsive hydrogels; and various applications of additive manufacturing hydrogels, such as neural catheter preparation and drug delivery. The opportunities, challenges, and future prospects of hydrogel additive manufacturing technologies are discussed.

AM is a materials-oriented manufacturing technology, and printing resolution versus printing scalability/speed trade-off exists among various types of materials, including polymers, metals, ceramics, glasses, and composite materials. Four-dimensional (4D) printing, together with versatile transformation systems, drives researchers to achieve and utilize high dimensional AM. Multiple perspectives of the AM of structural materials have been raised and illustrated in this review, including multimaterial AM (MMa-AM), multi-modulus AM (MMo-AM), multi-scale AM (MSc-AM), multi-system AM (MSyAM), multi-dimensional AM (MD-AM), and multi-function AM (MF-AM). The rapid and tremendous development of AM materials and methods offers great potential for structural applications, such as in the aerospace field, the biomedical field, electronic devices, nuclear industry, flexible and wearable devices, soft sensors, actuators, and robotics, jewelry and art decorations, land transportation, underwater devices, and porous structures.

Defects such as inadvertent voids between deposited rasters and layers lead to weakness in produced parts, which results in inferior mechanical properties as compared to injection molding. An alternative method to change energy absorption and stiffness of a polymer is hybrid additive manufacturing (AM). Hybrid-AM is the use of additive manufacturing with one or more secondary processes that are fully coupled and synergistically affect part quality, functionality, and/or process performance. In this study, fused filament fabrication (FFF) was coupled with layer-kv-layer shot peening to study the dynamic mechanical properties of ABS 430 polymer using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). FFF is a heated extrusion process. Shot peening is a mechanical surface treatment that impinges a target with a stochastically dispersed, high velocity stream of beads. Compressive residual stress was imparted to preferential layer intervals during printing to modify the elasticity (stiffiless), viscosity, toughness, and glass transition temperature. Viscoelastic and dynamic mechanical properties are important to the performance of polymers in automotive, aerospace, electronics, and medical components. Coupling printing and peening increased the storage and loss moduli as well as the tangent delta. DMA results suggest that preferential layer sequences exist that possess higher elasticity and better absorb energy upon sinusoidal dynamic loading.

The reduction of the heat loss by incorporating porosity in a monolithic material was studied. To this aim, lattice structures with varying lattice topology and specimen size were synthesised using polymer based additive manufacturing. Commercially available 3D printers and polymer filaments were utilised to manufacture such polymer lattices. Their thermal performance was characterised using a bespoke compact temperature-change hot chamber. A scaling law, based on the experimental results, has been proposed for the first time to predict the U-value of polymer lattices by correlating their effective thermal conductivities. It was observed that the lattice's relative density and the sizes of a unit cell and specimen affected significantly the U-value. Also, it was found that polymer-lattice structures can be designed to only allow a conductive mode of heat transfer when their hydraulic diameter was less than 8 mm. The effect of an AM process parameters such as the layer thickness and type of 3D printer on the U-value of the polymer lattices was also characterised and found that they had a mild effect on the U-value of the lattices. Thus, a highly optimised lattice structure, aiming at achieving the higher thermal resistance to make it suitable for energy saving applications, can be obtained using the proposed scaling law.

It is expected to further boost the research into producing a whole tooth, capable to harmoniously integrate with the surrounding periodontium, which represents the ultimate goal of tissue engineering in dentistry. Because of their high versatility associated with the wide variety of available materials, additive manufacturing in dentistry predominantly targets the production of polymeric constructs. The aim of this narrative review is to catch a glimpse of the current state-of-the-art of additive manufacturing in dentistry, and the future perspectives of this modern technology, focusing on the specific polymeric materials.

Additive manufacturing of arterial phantoms with integrated electroactive polymer actuators: effect of stenosis and dilation on flow characteristics	ELECTROACTIVE POLYMER ACTUATORS AND DEVICES (EAPAD) XXI	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	21st Conference on Electroactive Polymer Actuators and Devices (EAPAD) XXI	MAR 04-07, 2019	Denver, CO	SPIE, OZ Opt Ltd, Polytec Inc		Electroactive Polymers; Additive Manufacturing; PEDOT:PSS; Direct Ink Writing; Particle Image Velocimetry		Fabrication of arterial phantoms is enabled through specially developed additive manufacturing techniques in the Organic Mechatronics and Smart Materials Laboratory to produce high resolution 3D conjugated polymer structures. These techniques have been modified to enable fabrication of arterial phantoms through the direct ink writing of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) into a microgel support bath. This support bath behaves as a Bingham plastic, deforming under shear stress during extrusion but quickly returning to solid-state, thus supporting the PDMS and allowing the desired structure to be maintained, producing high-resolution complex geometries. Following curing and removal of the PDMS phantom from the support bath, PEDOT:PSS thin films are selectively deposited on the phantom surface. These films have demonstrated significant hygroscopic actuation under an applied electric field. These phantoms may be imaged with Particle image velocimetry (PIV) to characterize the effect of actively changing vessel geometry. PIV can provide the instantaneous full-field velocity profile and is a well-established technique to characterize flow through phantoms fabricated by conventional casting techniques to provide a standard of comparison. To effectively image the device via PIV, the optical properties of the components must be considered. To this end, PDMS and PEDOT:PSS have been employed due to their favourable transmission properties in the visible spectrum. Additionally, PDMS provides a compliant passive structure to be deformed with relatively low force, easing the performance requirements of the actuators. While this device focuses on the actuation of phantom vessel geometry, this technique may be extended to other applications in microfluidics to create onboard peristaltic pumping action and vascular networks.

Failure Analysis of Additive Manufactured Fiber-Reinforced Thermoplastics	JOURNAL OF FAILURE ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Thermoplastics; Failure analysis; Fiber reinforced	COMPOSITES	In the present work, a comprehensive study is undertaken to analyze the mechanical strength and failure of different polymers reinforced with adaptable fibers. For the purpose of analyzing tensile strength, specimens as per ASTM standards with different permutations and combinations of polymers with fibers were additively manufactured and tested. Three different sets of samples, namely ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene), PLA (polylactic acid) and onyx in combination with other synthetic fibers such as carbon and Kevlar, were used. These materials, i.e., ABS, PLA and onyx in combination with carbon fiber, have generated a healthy response to tensile loading and exhibited much higher peak load with larger plastic phase. Also, these additive manufactured fiber-reinforced thermoplastics' failure was analyzed using von Mises criterion and is found to be within the recommended limit. These reinforced thermoplastics can be used for manufacturing of tiny, intricate and complex parts for medical applications.	[Nayak, Siddharth M.; Shetty, P. Balachandra; Reddy, Sudheer; Viraj, G.

Direct joining by layered extrusion was used to fabricate hybrid single lap joints of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and aluminum alloy 5052. The influence of the printing speed, bed temperature, and nozzle Z-offset on the lap shear strength was studied experimentally. The interface between the two materials was also observed under scanning electron microscope, and the chemical state of the polymer after printing was analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results revealed that elevated bed temperature and pressure application through lowering the Z-offset promoted better polymer filling of the metal surface structure and improved the joint strength by mechanical interlocking. Also, long exposure time to the heated build plate corresponding to low printing speeds lowered the mechanical performance of the polymer bulk due to thermal degradation. Mechanical interlocking was the main joining mechanism, but under high bed temperatures where the carbonyl group had formed due to degradation, a (C-O-Al) chemical bond was detected.

J	Fu, XZ; Fan, ZY				Fu, Xianzhe; Fan, Zhaoyan			Material Composition Sensing for Additive Manufacturing Based on Cooling Rate Monitoring	MANUFACTURING LETTERS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	50th SME North American Manufacturing Research Conference (NAMRC)	JUN 27-JUL 01, 2022	Purdue Univ, West Lafayette, IN	SME	Purdue Univ	Additive manufacturing; multi-material printing; cooling rate; composition monitoring	LASER-INDUCED PLASMA	Additive manufacturing (AM) has become a widely applied process to print polymer and metallic parts in small scale. In recent years, AM processes and instruments are developed to print structure with two or multiple materials to form alloy during printing. The material composition in the printing process became a critical issue in determining the quality of the printed part. This paper presents a new approach to detect the metal material composition in the printed structure through thermal imaging. This approach tests the temperature variation and cooling rate of the melt metal during it is cooling down to solid. Through a theoretical model, it is proved that the cooling rate is a function of the material thermal properties, which can be made use of for retrieving the material composition. For copper-Inconel 625 alloy, an alloy widely studied in metal additive manufacturing technology, the theoretical model shows that the cooling rate monotonically increases with the increase of copper's weight percentage at constant temperature. Such a relationship is also experimentally tested by using a high-speed camera observing the process of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). The experimental results validate the relationship given by the theoretical model. It shows that the developed technique is able to serve as a new methodology to measure the alloy composition in real-time, for improving the consistency of mechanical/thermal properties of the printed parts.

This could have a major impact in the fields of robotics and mechatronics as it has the potential to allow large wiring looms, often an issue with complex robotic systems, to be printed as an integral part of the products plastic shell. This paper describes the development of a novel Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process in which the layers of material that make up the part are deposited as curved layers instead of the conventional flat layers. This opens up possibilities of building curved plastic parts that have conductive electronic tracks and components printed as an integral part of the plastic component, thereby eliminating printed circuit boards and wiring. It is not possible to do this with existing flat-layer additive manufacturing technologies as the continuity of a circuit could be interrupted between the layers. With curved-layer fused deposition modeling (CLFDM) this problem is removed as continuous filaments in 3 dimensions can be produced, allowing for continuous conductive circuits.

However, FFF as a fabrication process for blended polymeric materials needs to be optimized for enhanced mechanical properties. In this work, biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA)/polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) dog-bone and notched specimens are printed to determine optimum printing parameters for superior mechanical properties in FFF additive manufacturing. The effect of layer thickness, infill density, and printing bed temperature on mechanical properties is investigated by employing a design of experiments (DoE) approach using response surface methodology (RSM). Experimental results showed the significance of the opted parameters for mechanical properties of the PLA/PHA blend. Then, optimum values for layer thickness, infill density, and printing bed temperature are identified for tensile and impact strength and an empirical relationship between parameters is formulated for low density and cost-effective fabrication. Finally, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) is performed to check the adequacy of the model for the influence of process parameters and their mutual interactions. The verification experiments validated the adequacy of the proposed model for PLA/PHA blend in FFF additive manufacturing.

Within this contribution the applicability of the process for the production of spherical polymer microparticles will be outlined. Size reduction of the polymer raw melt emulsion was realized in a rotor-stator-device. The process is characterized for paraffin and polyethylene (PE) waxes in aqueous environment using Tween 85 as an emulsifier. Process temperature and dispersed phase viscosity have the largest impact on the particle size distribution (PSD): decreasing temperature and viscosity leads to smaller particles. The suitability of the melt emulsification process for technical polymers is demonstrated for polypropylene (PP) emulsified in a continuous hexadecane phase. Polymer particles obtained by the proposed method are promising candidates for advanced powders for additive manufacturing processes like selective laser beam melting (LBM) of polymers. The LBM processability of the obtained PP powders is demonstrated by production of sintered layers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Because advanced functional materials often do not possess suitable mechanical and rheological properties for conventional fused deposition modeling, a key challenge that researchers face is in integrating custom deposition tool heads that enable printing of non-filamentary materials while preserving synchrony with the motion axes. In this article, we demonstrate a highly versatile hardware and software platform for melt and solution-phase benchtop AM and highlight patterning and post-deposition processing of a series of non-filament forming functional polymers, including PS-b-PLA bottlebrush block copolymers, semiconducting polymer DPP2T-TT, conducting polymer PEDOT:PSS [poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate)], and an SiO2-PE nanoporous polymer matrix composite. We present a free and open-source Python module, PolyChemPrint, which serves as a research-optimized AM control software. The cross-platform (Windows/Linux) software is designed to be extremely flexible in terms the hardware that can be connected and a detailed user manual and developer guide are provided for use by researchers without extensive computer programming experience. Finally, we provide extensive details of the hardware used for operation of low- and high-pressure pneumatic extruders and a laser module as rapidly interchangeable tool heads.

This process employs micron-sized polymer particles, which are selectively fused by a laser. While there seem to be hardly any boundaries regarding design, there are quite some restrictions concerning the variety of commercially available SLS materials. At the moment, the most widely used polymeric material for SLS is polyamide 12 (PA12), with a market share of roughly 95%. In order to broaden the field of application of SLS, novel polymer powders with good handling properties are needed. In this contribution, different liquid phase processes enabling the manufacturing of spherical micron-sized polymer particles are outlined.

Particularly granule extrusion technologies enable the processing of an enormous variety of materials but also introduce new challenges in printing large-scale parts. Compared to fused layer modelling and due to larger nozzle diameters as well as higher extrusion rates strand geometry and consequently, process-related voids are enlarged. A promising approach to improve part quality is the integration of carbon dioxide laser (CO2) radiation into the additive manufacturing process to weld deposited strands by increasing the interface temperature. Experiments are conducted for polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN) which are very good absorbers of the wavelength 10.6 mu m. Due to the locally defined heat treatment, merely certain areas of the strands are heated to a desired temperature. This leads to a more complete diffusion. At the same time, temperature gradients in the overall part are avoided. By means of a thermographic camera, the temperatures at the re-melting process of deposited strands can be precisely monitored. Therefore, the relation between laser intensity and resulting temperature can be transferred into a repeatable process window. The interaction between laser and deposited material leads to a wider contact area between stacked strands. While flexural strength is not significantly affected, compared to specimens manufactured without any heat treatment bending force is increased by 66% (PMMA) and 48% (SAN), respectively. In addition, voids between adjacent strands are reduced by up to 57%.

In forming, rapid tooling is applied in the production of metallic or plastic tools that guarantee good performance in small- and medium-sized batch production. However, most punches tested to date have dimensions measured in millimeters and are therefore unsuitable for typical real-world industrial processes. In this study, the performance of plastic punches with geometries designed for industrial application was investigated. A deep drawing process involving AISI 304 blanks was created for the manufacturing of cups. Experimental and numerical analyses were conducted to measure the quality of the cups produced and the behaviour of the punches involved. The results indicate that when punch dimensions increase, a more precise cup geometry is produced (99% of drawing depth, 98% of cup precision on the fillet radius, and roundness error equal to 0.53%).

Since then, with the changing human needs, these naturally occurring fibres are finding new applications and uses. Due to their high specific strength, low density, and biocompatibility, these natural fibres have found use as filler materials in advanced composite materials in the 21st century. In an environment concerned and the energy-hungry world, another notable stride towards sustainable engineering is the use of additive manufacturing. Due to its low energy consumption, minimal material wastage, and easy fabricability of complicated parts, additive manufacturing has gained attention as the norm of the future. Hence, there has been increasing popularity to try and manufacture composite reinforced with natural fibres through the additive manufacturing route. In this paper, we have tried to summarize the recent developments in the field of additive manufacturing of Natural fibre reinforced composites. Comprehensive discussions regarding the different kinds of natural fibres, additive manufacturing routes, pre-processing of natural fibres and their biodegradability have been included. In the end, we have drawn some conclusions and have suggested future directions to the research. Copyright (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) is a thermoplastic semi-crystalline polymer belonging to the PAEKs family, which, together with its composites, has been proved to be processable via Additive Manufacturing, in particular via Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF), enabling the production of parts both on-ground and possibly even for out-of-earth. In the past years, extensive efforts have been spent on the improvement of 3D-printed polymeric structures, extending the applications of high-performance polymers from purely mechanical to functional ones. It is possible to confer new properties to polymers by mixing and blending tailored fillers and different additives (e.g., clays, NdFeB powders, magnetite, and carbon fillers). Composite and nanocomposite polymers present customized functional properties such as electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, soft and hard magnetic properties absent or utterly different from the ones of pure polymer. In this paper, we report the state of the art on 3D-printed PEEK composites, their mechanical properties, and functionalities in view of the production of parts made of PEEK composites and nanocomposites, and their possible space applications (e.g., electromagnetic devices, magnetic shielding, thermal protection system and sensors).

One of the AM methods is multi-jet printing, which offers high accuracy of printed polymeric elements and the possibility of manufacturing products with complex shapes. Elements manufactured using AM are exploited in many industrial branches, e.g. energetic, medicine or aerospace. It results in development of structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. Among a variety of sensors applied for SHM systems fibre Bragg grating sensors (FBG) are a very promising solution. Their advantages, such as small size, multiplexing capabilities and no calibration requirements, allow them to be embedded into different material types. The goal of the paper is to analyze possibility of FBG sensors embedding into an AM polymeric material.

It has enabled technological advances across many domains, from space to medical devices. The polymer composites fabricated through AM have tremendous advantages over conventional polymers in terms of mechanical performance and are, therefore, better suited for producing functional parts and assemblies. However, AM of polymer composites still presents several technological obstacles that prevent their full commercial utilization. These challenges include limited combinations of matrix and reinforcements, a requirement for hardware modification of existing machines, and challenges in mechanical characterization. This article attempts to comprehensively review the fundamentals and features of contemporary additively manufactured polymer composites (AMPCs) and examines current cutting-edge research and development. This review highlights the gaps in the mechanical characterization of polymer composites fabricated through various technologies like material extrusion, vat-photopolymerization, binder jetting, material jetting, powder bed fusion, and sheet lamination. There is a need to fill the identified research gaps to make AMPCs more appealing for widespread industrial use for advanced applications.

J	Hossain, M; Liao, ZS				Hossain, Mokarram; Liao, Zisheng			An additively manufactured silicone polymer: Thermo-viscoelastic experimental study and computational modelling	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						3D printing; Silicone polymer (SIL30); Digital light synthesis (DLS); Additive manufacturing; Thermo-viscoelastic modelling; Metamaterials	MECHANICAL CHARACTERIZATION; PARAMETER-IDENTIFICATION; BEHAVIOR; RUBBER; VISCOELASTICITY	The additive manufacturing (AM) is a new paradigm across various disciplines of engineering sciences. Despite significant advances in the areas of hard material printings, the options for 3D printed soft materials are still limited. Most of the existing 3D printed polymers are in the areas of acrylics and polyurethanes or their composites. Recently emerged Digital Light Synthesis (DLS) technology hugely accelerates the additive manufacturing of soft polymers. A DLS-inspired 3D printer uses a continuous building technique instead of a layer-bylayer approach, where the curing process is activated by an ultra-violet (UV) light. In this contribution, a DLS-based digitally printed silicone (SIL30) is experimentally characterized. To understand polymer's temperature-dependent mechanical responses, an extensive thermo-viscoelastic experimental characterisation at various strain rates under tensile deformation and temperature fields from -20 degrees C to 60 degrees C is performed. The study reveals significant effects of time-and temperature-dependency on the mechanical responses of the 3D printed silicone. Motivated by the thermo-mechanical results of the polymer, a thermodynamically consistent constitutive model at large strain is devised. Afterwards, the model is calibrated to the data that results in the identification of relevant parameters. The model predicts the experimental results with a good accuracy. 3D printed soft polymers are major candidates in designing complex and intricate architectured metamaterials for biomedical applications. Hence, a comprehensive thermo-mechanical experimental study and subsequent constitutive modelling will facilitate in designing and simulating more complex cellular metamaterials using 3D printed silicones.

Additive Manufacturing of Photopolymers using the Texas Instruments DLP Lightcrafter	EMERGING DIGITAL MICROMIRROR DEVICE BASED SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS V	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Emerging Digital Micromirror Device Based Systems and Applications V	FEB 05-06, 2013	San Francisco, CA	SPIE, DLP Texas Instruments, VUZIX Corp		DLP Lightcrafter; photosensitive resin; additive manufacturing technologies		The use of the Texas Instruments DLP (R) LightCrafter (TM) as a compact module in lithography-based additive manufacturing technologies (AMT) is discussed in this paper. For this purpose the light engine is placed underneath a transparent vat which is coated with a PTFE-film and filled with photosensitive resin. By loading an appropriate bitmap into the light engine, the resin can be exposed selectively to obtain a photopolymerized layer. To integrate the device into the building process, a configurable I/O trigger is required since the loaded bitmap should be exposed only in a certain period (exposure time). By stacking up the individual layers with a typical layer thickness between 25 and 50 mu m, a three-dimensional part is built up. The current setup of the used digital LEDs in combination with a customized optical projection system ensures a spatial and temporal homogeneity of the intensity at the build platform, which is significantly better than with traditionally used engines. It could be shown that this system can fabricate three-dimensional parts with a resolution < 40 mu m in x-y plane and 15 mu m in z-axis. Additionally, mechanical properties (e. g. bending strength) were measured and potential anisotropies, which might be caused by the layered manufacturing process, were assessed. Ceramic-filled polymers were also used and the necessary post-processing steps like the removal of the polymer phase after structuring and the final sintering step to obtain fully dense ceramic parts are discussed.

Relaxation times were determined through rheology investigations of the neat polymers and were extrapolated across the entire process temperature range to estimate the required welding times for optimal bond formation. For the calculation of bond formation during cooling from the melt, the semicrystalline polyaryletherketone is considered amorphous until the onset of crystallization which is determined by recreating the process thermal history in DSC measurements. A significant improvement in bond development during additive manufacturing is achieved through the use of specifically designed polymers with slower crystallization kinetics. Both in small-scale additive manufacturing, achieving full bonding, and in large-scale additive manufacturing, they achieve significantly higher interlaminar strength than the reference material, validated by three-point bending. A very good match between the estimated degree of bonding and the tested strength of upright printed specimens in three-point bending was found. While the fusion bonding model calculates a degree of bonding of 42.07%, mechanical testing showed 42.54% of the bulk flexural strength. The study outlines a procedure to evaluate materials for additive manufacturing by material extrusion based on small material samples to shorten and improve the process development.

In this research, the sheet lamination (SL) route of friction stir additive manufacturing (FTAM) technology was implemented for the production of a poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA) polymer matrix composite structure as reinforced by textile stainless steel layers, and feeding of PMMA granulates inside the stirred region. Layers bonding and the soundness of composite formation during fabrication of the laminated structure were studied. Possible chemical interactions between the steel and PMMA during friction stir mixing followed by solid-state consolidation of composite layers were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The results revealed some evidence for dipole bonding between iron with oxygen and carbon elements. Orientation dependency of polymer-steel sheet laminated composite structures was demonstrated by universal tensile testing and flexural bending from different sections and fractographic analyses. Superior flexural bending (around 90% of PMMA) was shown for the produced layered structure.	[Derazkola, H.

There are several variants of AM; among them material extrusion (ME) is one of the most versatile and widely used. In MEAM, molten or viscous materials are pushed through an orifice and are selectively deposited as strands to form stacked layers and subsequently a three-dimensional object. The commonly used materials for MEAM are thermoplastic polymers and particulate composites; however, recently innovative formulations of highly-filled polymers (HP) with metals or ceramics have also been made available. MEAM with HP is an indirect process, which uses sacrificial polymeric binders to shape metallic and ceramic components. After removing the binder, the powder particles are fused together in a conventional sintering step. In this review the different types of MEAM techniques and relevant industrial approaches for the fabrication of metallic and ceramic components are described. The composition of certain HP binder systems and powders are presented; the methods of compounding and filament making HP are explained; the stages of shaping, debinding, and sintering are discussed; and finally a comparison of the parts produced via MEAM-HP with those produced via other manufacturing techniques is presented.

However, it is still hindered by raw material selection, processing defects and final product assessment/adjustment in pre-, in- and post-processing stages. Spectroscopic techniques offer suitable inspection, diagnosis and product trouble-shooting at each stage of AM processing. This review outlines the limitations in AM processes and the prospective role of spectroscopy in addressing these challenges. An overview on the principles and applications of AM techniques is presented, followed by the principles of spectroscopic techniques involved in AM and their applications in assessing additively manufactured parts.

To prepare a heat sink with high thermal conductivity (TC), we use vat photopolymerization (VPP) of a polymer-based composite material with a low TC that is enhanced by loading with a graphene-based thermally conductive filler. Phase separation of the carbon-based filler, in this case graphene nanoplatelets (GNP), in the monomer printing solution is prevented by stabilizing the GNPs by the addition of a second fiber-like clay (sepiolite) filler, which traps the GNPs. This methodology enables the AM of a composite with a relatively high GNP concentration of 2.0 wt %, yielding a TC increase of 160 % vs. the pristine polymer-an impressive accomplishment for VPP 3D printing. Moreover, this printing technique yields a material with anisotropic TC with a cross-plane/in-plane (TC/TC=) ratio of 1.6, which is beneficial for thermal management systems required to dissipate the heat vertically from a heat source. Such VPP 3D-printed composites with high and anisotropic TC could be applied in thermal management systems made of lightweight and costeffective materials.

Slipcasting technique was used to prepare sample as a traditional way, from pink alumina ceramic slurry with further drying a high temperature treatment of dried preformed ceramics. For preparation of second sample by additive route, stereolythography or SLA 3D-printing was used. This sample firstly formed a so called green body ceramic from photopolymerazed slurry, that forms an organo-inorganic composite with alumina as a filler. Preformed green body ceramic then undergoes a several stages of heat treatment: first is debinding process, at low temperature to rid of polymer binder and second stage is annealing at higher temperatures to fuse alumina particles together and get desired strength and porosity level. Samples were studied using GE Vtomex c 450 X-ray tomography device. It allowed to compare accuracy of geometry, surface roughness and porosity of samples. It is shown that additive technology due to high accuracy of fabrication is a perspective way of precision fabrication of ceramic parts with high quality. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A Fully Coupled Simulation of Planar Deposition Flow and Fiber Orientation in Polymer Composites Additive Manufacturing	MATERIALS			English	Article						polymer composites deposition additive manufacturing; short fiber reinforced composites; flow-orientation coupling impacts; planar flow model; Advani-Tucker orientation tensor	FUSED-FILAMENT-FABRICATION; NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS; THERMAL-PROPERTIES; NOZZLE GEOMETRY; CARBON-FIBER; EXTRUSION; SUSPENSIONS; STATE; VALIDATION; PARTICLES	Numerical studies for polymer composites deposition additive manufacturing have provided significant insight promoting the rapid development of the technology. However, little of existing literature addresses the complex yet important polymer composite melt flow-fiber orientation coupling during deposition. This paper explores the effect of flow-fiber interaction for polymer deposition of 13 wt.% Carbon Fiber filled Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (CF/ABS) composites through a finite-element-based numerical approach. The molten composite flow in the extrusion die plus a strand of the deposited bead contacting the deposition substrate is modelled using a 2D isothermal and incompressible Newtonian planar flow model, where the material deposition rate is similar to 110 mm/s simulating a large scale additive manufacturing process. The Folgar-Tucker model associated with the Advani-Tucker orientation tensor approach is adopted for the evaluation of the fiber orientation state, where the orthotropic fitted closure is applied. By comparing the computed results between the uncoupled and fully coupled solutions, it is found that the flow-orientation effects are mostly seen in the nozzle convergence zone and the extrusion-deposition transition zone of the flow domain. Further, the fully coupled fiber orientation solution is highly sensitive to the choice of the fiber-fiber interaction coefficient CI, e.g., assigning CI as 0.01 and 0.001 results in a 23% partial relative difference in the predicted elastic modulus along deposition direction. In addition, Structural properties of deposited CF/ABS beads based on our predicted fiber orientation results show favorable agreements with related experimental studies.

Although this technique has been mainly used for rapid prototyping, interest is growing in direct manufacture of actual parts. For wide spread application of 3D additive manufacturing, both techniques and feedstock materials require improvements to meet the mechanical requirements of load-bearing components. Here, we investigated short fiber (0.2-0.4 mm) reinforced acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene composites as a feedstock for 3D-printing in terms of their processibility, microstructure and mechanical performance. The additive components are also compared with traditional compression molded composites. The tensile strength and modulus of 3D-printed samples increased similar to 115% and similar to 700%, respectively. 3D-printing yielded samples with very high fiber orientation in the printing direction (up to 91.5%), whereas, compression molding process yielded samples with significantly lower fiber orientation. Microstructure-mechanical property relationships revealed that although a relatively high porosity is observed in 3D-printed composites as compared to those produced by the conventional compression molding technique, they both exhibited comparable tensile strength and modulus. This phenomenon is explained based on the changes in fiber orientation, dispersion and void formation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

FDM materials are currently limited to a selected number of polymers. The present study focused on investigating the potential of using high-end engineering polymers in FDM. In addition, a critical review of the materials available on the market compared with those studied here was completed. Methods: Different engineering thermoplastics, ranging from industrial grade polycarbonates to novel polyetheretherketones (PEEKs), were processed by FDM. Prior to this, for innovative filaments based on PEEK, extrusion processing was carried out. Mechanical properties (i.e., tensile and flexural) were investigated for each extruded material. An industrial-type FDM machine (Stratasys Fortus((R)) 400 mc) was used to fully characterize the effect of printing parameters on the mechanical properties of polycarbonate. The obtained properties were compared with samples obtained by injection molding. Finally, FDM samples made of PEEK were also characterized and compared with those obtained by injection molding. Results: The effect of raster to raster air gap and raster angle on tensile and flexural properties of printed PC was evidenced; the potential of PEEK filaments, as novel FDM material, was highlighted in comparison to state of the art materials. Conclusions: Comparison with injection molded parts allowed to better understand FDM potential for functional applications. The study discussed pros and cons of the different materials. Finally, the development of novel PEEK filaments achieved important results offering a novel solution to the market when high mechanical and thermal properties are required.

However, rigid traces and uncontrollable electrical resistance under bending conditions remain critical problems in the application of flexible electronics. Herein, we investigated a four-axis additive manufacturing method for creating non-planar flexible electronics utilizing polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) as substrate and a polymer-copper conductive composite as the trace. The as-printed specimens exhibited high dimensional accuracy and matchable surface roughness compared with the printed planar ones. The interfacial bonding was revealed by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and peeling test, and the interfacial gaps were observed due to the surface roughness. Besides, the resistance of the non planar electronics varied with the bending of the specimens during the compression test. The as-built non-planar specimens showed significantly lower resistance than the planar ones tested in a conformably bent condition. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The polymeric precursors include an allyl hydrido polycarbosilane (SMP-10), a mixture of SMP-10 with a reactive ester (1,6-hexanediol diacrylate, HDDA), and a polydimethylsiloxane (4690A/B). The SMP-10/HDDA proved to have outstanding photo-curing properties, high-resolution printing, and the ability to easily transform into the silicon carbide phase. The same polymeric mixture showed the lowest viscosity value which is preferred in vat additive manufacturing. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that, after pyrolysis to 1350 degrees C, the polydimethylsiloxane polymer showed the highest onset decomposition temperature and the lowest retained weight (52 wt%) while the allyl hydrido polycarbosilane showed the lowest onset decomposition temperature and highest retained weight (71.7 wt%). In terms of crystallography, X-ray diffraction and microstructural results showed that the ceramic matrix composites contained both silicon carbide and silicon oxycarbide. Overall, the results are very promising for the fabrication of ceramic materials using additive manufacturing technologies.	[Al-Ajrash, Saja M.

A recent technology, developed by Markforged, has raised these capabilities to a new level by allowing the printing of polymer matrix composites with continuous fiber reinforcement. However, as this is a new manufacturing method, there is no consolidated model to predict the mechanical characteristics or failure modes they present when subjected to loads. The present work gathers the studies on the damage and progressive failure in composite materials with long fibers produced by additive manufacturing.

Temperature-dependent optical material properties of polymer powders regarding in-situ measurement techniques in additive manufacturing	POLYMER TESTING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Selective laser sintering; In-situ measurement; Process-oriented optical material qualification; Integration spheres		Due to the growing number of applications for Additive Manufacturing (AM), an increasing need for enhanced quality control methods exists. Here optical measurement techniques are often used for in-situ monitoring in AM. There is a great potential to standardize and improve applications of optical measurement devices in accordance to the increasing requirements of measuring tasks. Beside the optical material qualifications, especially process-oriented changes in optical effects are of great relevance for in-situ evaluations. The optical modifications may be attributed to aggregate specific phase transitions coming along with variable emitted wavelengths. A measuring setup with two integrations spheres and a heated process chamber have been developed to analyze the optical interactions of laser radiation and visual illumination with the powder. The process oriented analysis for selective laser sintering lead to improved operating conditions in the field of in-situ measurements in combination with an accurate evaluation of the absorption ratio of the examined powder.

The present stage wherein a 3D printer is capable of printing queer hybrid materials was not imagined through conventional manufacturing albeit it is meager existence in a few instances. Its expendable arms stretch to the maximum level that is even clearly addressed in Industry 4.0 too, by making at least a printer in a company for printing specific customized materials. The dream of printing composite material was been a long-term goal for researchers worldwide. This article primarily focuses on this niche area of printing natural fiber composite materials that too specifically jute fiber-reinforced composites. Very few pieces of literature are available on additive manufacturing of specific natural fibers. As the technique for printing natural fiber-reinforced composites is still under evolution, this study will be more interesting as it consolidates the facts and figures involved in 3D of jute fiber reinforced composites alone. Different forms of jute fibers used by the researchers include weaved jute, jute as continuous fiber, filament along with jute, jute fiber as reinforcement, jute used as rope as well as jute fiber as cement matrix and all these forms have been addressed in this review.

The potential toxicological effects of emissions produced in the process, involving both ultrafine particles and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), are unclear, and there are concerns regarding possible health implications among AM operators.The objective of this study was to screen the presence of respiratory health effects among people working with liquid, powdered, or filament plastic materials in AM. MethodsIn total, 18 subjects working with different additive manufacturing techniques and production of filament with polymer feedstock and 20 controls participated in the study. Study subjects filled out a questionnaire and underwent blood and urine sampling, spirometry, impulse oscillometry (IOS), exhaled NO test (FeNO), and collection of particles in exhaled air (PEx), and the exposure was assessed. Analysis of exhaled particles included lung surfactant components such as surfactant protein A (SP-A) and phosphatidylcholines. SP-A and albumin were determined using ELISA. Using reversed-phase liquid chromatography and targeted mass spectrometry, the relative abundance of 15 species of phosphatidylcholine (PC) was determined in exhaled particles. The results were evaluated by univariate and multivariate statistical analyses (principal component analysis). ResultsExposure and emission measurements in AM settings revealed a large variation in particle and VOC concentrations as well as the composition of VOCs, depending on the AM technique and feedstock. Levels of FeNO, IOS, and spirometry parameters were within clinical reference values for all AM operators. There was a difference in the relative abundance of saturated, notably dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (PC16:0_16:0), and unsaturated lung surfactant lipids in exhaled particles between controls and AM operators. ConclusionThere were no statistically significant differences between AM operators and controls for the different health examinations, which may be due to the low number of participants. However, the observed difference in the PC lipid profile in exhaled particles indicates a possible impact of the exposure and could be used as possible early biomarkers of adverse effects in the airways.

With advances in membrane electrode assembly design, greater attention has been focused on the bipolar plate and the important role it plays. Although carbon composite plates are a likely candidate for the mass introduction of fuel cells, it is metallic plates made from thin strip materials which could deliver significant advantages in terms of part cost, electrical performance and size. However, there are some disadvantages. Firstly, interfacial stability of the metal interconnect is difficult to achieve. Secondly, and the issue addressed here, is the difficultly and cost in developing new plate designs when there are very significant tooling costs associated with manufacture. The use of selective laser melting (SLM: an additive manufacturing technique) was explored to produce metallic bipolar plates for PEMFC as a route to inexpensively test several plate designs without committing to tooling. Crucial to this was proving that, electrically, bipolar plates fabricated by SLM behave similarly to those produced by conventional manufacturing techniques. This research presents the development of a small stack to compare the short term performance of metallic plates made by machining against those made by SLM. Experimental results demonstrate that the cell performance in this case was unaffected by the manufacturing method used and it is therefore concluded that additive manufacturing could be a very useful tool to aid the rapid development of metallic bipolar plate designs.

Such methods can be applied for a variety of materials, like ceramics, polymers, and metals. It results in wide applicability of AM elements in many industrial branches, e.g. energetic, medicine or aerospace. Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors due to their small dimensions and high chemical durability can be embedded into different material types. The goal of the paper is to analyze an influence of FBG sensors embedded into an AM polymeric samples on the polymeric structure durability. The samples will be manufactured using multi-jet printing method. The method was chosen due to its high accuracy of printed polymeric elements and the possibility of manufacturing products with complex shapes. The analyzes will be related to tensile strength determination of the samples with embedded FBG sensors. The comparisons will be performed for the samples without sensors and with sensors after manufacturing and after temperature treatment.

Universal Nanocarrier Ink Platform for Biomaterials Additive Manufacturing	SMALL			English	Article						additive manufacturing; bioprinting; drug delivery; polymer-nanoparticle hydrogels; tissue engineering; universal nanocarrier ink	3D; HYDROGELS; BIOINK; ALGINATE	Ink engineering is a fundamental area of research within additive manufacturing (AM) that designs next-generation biomaterials tailored for additive processes. During the design of new inks, specific requirements must be considered, such as flowability, postfabrication stability, biointegration, and controlled release of therapeutic molecules. To date, many (bio)inks have been developed; however, few are sufficiently versatile to address a broad range of applications. In this work, a universal nanocarrier ink platform is presented that provides tailored rheology for extrusion-based AM and facilitates the formulation of biofunctional inks. The universal nanocarrier ink (UNI) leverages reversible polymer-nanoparticle interactions to form a transient physical network with shear-thinning and self-healing properties engineered for direct ink writing (DIW). The unique advantage of the material is that a range of functional secondary polymers can be combined with the UNI to enable stabilization of printed constructs via secondary cross-linking as well as customized biofunctionality for tissue engineering and drug delivery applications. Specific UNI formulations are used for bioprinting of living tissue constructs and DIW of controlled release devices. The robust and versatile nature of the UNI platform enables rapid formulation of a broad range of functional inks for AM of advanced biomaterials.

High-cycle bending fatigue properties of additive-manufactured ABS and PLA polymers fabricated by fused deposition modeling 3D-printing	FORCES IN MECHANICS			English	Article						Fatigue properties; Additive manufacturing; 3D-printing; ABS polymer; PLA polymer; Fused deposition modeling	BEHAVIOR; SCAFFOLDS; LIFE	Nowadays, polymer parts made by additive manufacturing methods (AM) have multiple applications in various industries. Different parameters affect the print quality of the parts and subsequently their mechanical properties. In this study, the effect of the print direction in 3D-printing on the high-cycle bending fatigue properties of polymer parts made by the fused deposition modeling (FDM) method has been investigated. The standard samples of the fatigue test were printed in both horizontal and vertical directions and were made of two polymers, PLA and ABS. The thickness of each layer was 0.15 mm and the infill percentage of the parts was 50%. The rotary bending fatigue test was performed under conditions of fully-reversed stress-controlled loading at different stress levels. The results included the stress amplitude versus the fatigue lifetime of FDM 3D-printed PLA and ABS polymers. Besides, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the fracture surface was also depicted after fatigue testing. Results showed that PLA specimens had better fatigue lifetimes than ones of ABS samples. Moreover, the fatigue strength of 3D-printed samples in the horizontal direction was higher than that of 3D-printed specimens in the vertical direction. The print direction, the material and the stress level were found to be statistically significant factors from the analysis of variances. The SEM image demonstrated beach marks on the fracture surface of fibers (3D-printed filaments) in the PLA specimen, which proved cyclic loadings. Then, cleavage facets were the result of the brittle fracture.

The strengths of AM are primarily the rapid implementation of ideas into a usable product and the ability to produce geometrically complex shapes. It has also significantly advanced the lightweight design of products made of plastic. So far, the strength of printed components made of polymers is previously very limited. Recently, new AM processes have become available that allow the embedding of short and also long fibers in polymer matrix. Thus, the manufacturing of components that provide a significant increase in strength becomes possible. In this way, both complex geometries and sophisticated applications can be implemented. This paper therefore investigates how this new technology can be implemented in product development, focusing on sports equipment. An extensive literature research shows that lightweight design plays a decisive role in sports equipment. In addition, the advantages of AM in terms of individualized products and low quantities can be fully exploited. An example of this approach is the steering system for a seat sled used by paraplegic athletes in the Olympic discipline of Nordic paraskiing. A particular challenge here is the placement and alignment of the long carbon fibers within the polymer matrix and the verification of the strength by means of Finite-Element-Analysis (FEA). In addition, findings from bionics are used to optimize the lightweight design of the steering system. Using this example, it can be shown that the weight of the steering system can be drastically reduced compared to conventional manufacturing. At the same time, a number of parts can be saved through function integration and thus the manufacturing and assembly effort can be reduced significantly.

Analysis of additive manufactured Polymer Optical Waveguides: measurement and simulation of their waviness	INTEGRATED OPTICS: DEVICES, MATERIALS, AND TECHNOLOGIES XXIV	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Integrated Optics - Devices, Materials, and Technologies XXIV part of SPIE OPTO Conference	FEB 03-06, 2020	San Francisco, CA	SPIE		polymer optical waveguides; waviness; additive manufacturing; waveguide simulation; aerosol jet printing		This paper analyzes an approach for additively manufacturing polymer optical waveguides. The production process includes flexographic printing of conditioning lines (5 mu m height) on a substrate, which are used as guiding barriers in the subsequent printing of the optical core. The core is additively printed (up to 50 mu m in height) with an aerosol jet printer, filling the gap between the conditioning lines. The conditioning lines do not only enhance the contact angle of the polymer, which results in a higher cross section of the waveguides, but also improve the straight edges of the printed waveguides. We show that the quality of the conditioning lines is directly correlated to the waviness of the waveguides. Consequently, the analyses of the waviness of the conditioning lines classifies the quality of the fabricated waveguides. However, the waviness of the waveguides can also be considered in optical simulations. In this paper we show how we derive a waveguide model with waviness by fitting a single sine function onto the topological data of the conditioning lines. With this model a variation of the waviness can easily be simulated and goals for fabrication can be set. With the simulations it is possible to verify that the measured waviness (period of 559.5 mu m and an amplitude of 4.99 mu m) does not affect the optical quality of the waveguides.

Large-scale 3D printers for additive manufacturing: design considerations and challenges	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Material extrusion; Rapid prototyping; Large-format additive manufacturing	PARTS	Since the advent of 3D printing in the mid-1980s, additive manufacturing has grown steadily and found numerous applications across all types of industries. More recently, the industry has seen a spur of growth as the terms of the original patents expired and new companies entered the market. While there exist several different methods of additive manufacturing, polymer-based material extrusion 3D printing (also known as fused filament fabrication) has become one of the most widely used ones due to its lower cost, ease of use, and versatility. While development has greatly expanded the material availability and improved the quality of prints, material extrusion 3D printers have often faced a challenge in physical scaling. There are inherent design hurdles to the extrusion process when the print starts to grow larger. This paper aims to study the market landscape of extrusion-based 3D printing technology for polymer-based material as well as challenges faced in upscaling this technology for industrial applications. A prototype large-scale material extrusion 3D printer has been designed, constructed, and then tested to gain experimental data on large-scale 3D printing using thermoplastic polymers as a printing material. Results of testing and experimentation verified certain key design elements and how they can improve large-scale 3D printing. Testing also revealed how large diameter nozzles for the hot end introduce challenges not seen in small-scale 3D printers. This paper also seeks to consolidate available information pertaining to large-scale 3D printing into one comprehensive document.

J	Bajpai, A; Jain, PK				Bajpai, Arpit; Jain, Prashant Kumar			Investigation on using graphite filler for 3D printing of flexible electrically conductive polymer by extrusion-based additive manufacturing	POLYMER ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						additive manufacturing (AM); ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA); extrusion; flexible electrically conductive polymers; graphite powder	PARTS; NANOCOMPOSITES	The rapid use of additive manufacturing (AM) in electronic industry identifies the need of flexible electrically conductive materials suitable for 3D printing. Challenges like buckling of flexible filament and complexity in addition of conductive fillers makes pellet-based extrusion the most suitable alternative for part printing. In the present work, graphite powder is combined with ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) to print flexible electrically conductive parts. EVA graphite composite with filler loading up to 30% has been investigated for its electrical conductivity and part printability. The composite made was found electrically conductive and suitable for part printing. The parts were printed on a CNC milling machine by using a retrofitted material extrusion tool with nozzle of 0.4 mm diameter and temperature range of 130-140 degrees C. Parts were printed on a detchable heating bed placed on the milling machine setup. Samples of EVA with graphite filler by weight of 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30% were printed and were checked for electrical conductivity. When the filler content was increased from 10% to 20%, the electrical resistance of the composite was reduced by 62.6%. The presence and uniform dispersion of graphite flakes in the polymer matrix of EVA were guaranteed by the rheological and morphological characterization of the composite. Applications of 3D printable flexible electrically conductive parts lies in numerous domains including biosensors, wearable health monitoring devices, capacitors, field effective transistors, light emitting diodes, solar cells, and electronic displays.

Design for Additive Manufacturing	POLYMER-BASED ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING: BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Book Chapter						Design consideration; Design guidelines; Build orientation; Product optimisation; Topology optimisation	MODEL	Additive manufacturing has evolved over the past number of decades from a rapid prototyping technology into a viable net-shape manufacturing technology. Additively manufactured components are now being used for medical device applications all over the world, from custom splints and casts to implanted orthopaedic joints which improve patient experience quality of life. Traditional design for manufacturing and assembly (DFMA) guidelines have moulded the design transition from product concept to the final product, allowing manufacturers to produce products more efficiently and cost-effectively. In traditional manufacturing, as product complexity increases, both cost and manufacturing time also increases; thus, products are often simplified to improve manufacturability. Simplifying products, however, reduces both designer intent and often product performance. Additive manufacturing has many advantages over traditional manufacturing which will be discussed in this chapter, such as topology optimisation, geometrical design freedom and product consolidation as well as the ability to disrupt traditional supply chains. Additive manufacturing is not restrained by traditional DFMA guidelines, so as a result, design for additive manufacturing (DFAM) guidelines are instead used to guide product fabrication using this manufacturing technology. Additive manufacturing is suited to low-volume, complex components, and thus careful consideration should be given to the selection of this technology over traditional manufacturing technologies. Product design considerations such as build orientation and support structures will be presented which affect manufacturing cost and time, post-processing requirements as well as mechanical properties of the final component. Some case studies will be presented at the end of this chapter which use additive manufacturing to produce lighter, more geometrically complex or consolidated products.

Tooling for new molded product development as pilot case of integration of AM in the injection molding process chain is investigated. The study shows that injection molding based on AM for fabrication of polymer tool inserts is economically advantageous allowing 80-90% production costs reduction as compared with a conventional tooling process chain based on machining. Fabrication of soft tools with AM results in a production lead time reduction in the range of 60-70% compared to the time required to machine mold inserts in brass or aluminum.

This is one important reason for why additive manufacturing has not yet been fully utilised to produce degradable medical implants. Herein, the internal variation has been minimised during one batch cycle by assessing the effect of different processing parameters when using commercially available medical grade copolymers. To minimise the molar mass, thermal and mechanical variation within one batch cycle, the rheological fingerprint of the commercially available medical grade poly(L-lactide-co-epsilon-caprolactone) and poly(Llactide-co-trimethylene carbonate) has been correlated to the process parameters of the ARBURG Plastic Freeforming. An increase in the temperature up to 220 degrees C and the associated increase in pressure are beneficial for the viscoelastic and thermally stable poly(L-lactide-co-epsilon-caprolactone). In contrast, a temperature below 220 degrees C should be used for the poly(L-lactide-co-trimethylene carbonate) to reduce the variation in strain at break during one batch cycle. The residence time is decreased through the increase of the discharge parameter. An increase in temperature is however required to reduce the viscosity of the polymer and allow the pressure to stay within the machine limitations at higher discharge parameters. The results are highly relevant to the development of additive manufacturing for the production of degradable medical devices with identical properties. In fact, Food and Drug Administration guidelines for additive manufacturing of medical implants specify the need to control changes in for example material properties during the process.

J	He, LZ; Yin, J; Gao, X				He, Lizhe; Yin, Jun; Gao, Xiang			Additive Manufacturing of Bioactive Glass and Its Polymer Composites as Bone Tissue Engineering Scaffolds: A Review	BIOENGINEERING-BASEL			English	Review						additive manufacturing; bioactive glass; bone tissue engineering; scaffold		Bioactive glass (BG) and its polymer composites have demonstrated great potential as scaffolds for bone defect healing. Nonetheless, processing these materials into complex geometry to achieve either anatomy-fitting designs or the desired degradation behavior remains challenging. Additive manufacturing (AM) enables the fabrication of BG and BG/polymer objects with well-defined shapes and intricate porous structures. This work reviewed the recent advancements made in the AM of BG and BG/polymer composite scaffolds intended for bone tissue engineering. A literature search was performed using the Scopus database to include publications relevant to this topic. The properties of BG based on different inorganic glass formers, as well as BG/polymer composites, are first introduced. Melt extrusion, direct ink writing, powder bed fusion, and vat photopolymerization are AM technologies that are compatible with BG or BG/polymer processing and were reviewed in terms of their recent advances. The value of AM in the fabrication of BG or BG/polymer composites lies in its ability to produce scaffolds with patient-specific designs and the on-demand spatial distribution of biomaterials, both contributing to effective bone defect healing, as demonstrated by in vivo studies. Based on the relationships among structure, physiochemical properties, and biological function, AM-fabricated BG or BG/polymer composite scaffolds are valuable for achieving safer and more efficient bone defect healing in the future.

Polymer powders with high flowability, for example, play a crucial role in the emerging field of powder-based additive manufacturing processes. However, the polymer- and composite material selection for these technologies is still limited. Here, we demonstrate the design of spherical polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and PMMA-SiO2 composite supraparticle powders with excellent powder flowability and tailored composition for powder-based additive manufacturing. Our process assembles these powders from the bottom up and affords a precise control over surface roughness and internal morphology via the choice of colloidal primary particles. We establish process-structure-property relationships connecting external spray-drying parameters and primary particle sizes with the resulting supraparticle roughness and, subsequently, with the macroscopic powder flowability and powder bed density. In a second step, we demonstrate the control of composition and internal morphology of PMMA-SiO2 composite supraparticles based on different mass mixings and diameter ratios of the two primary particle dispersions. Finally, we successfully apply the prepared supraparticle powders in powder bed additive manufacturing. The optimized flowability of the composite powders allows the production of two-layered square specimens with fusion between the individual layers and a uniform and tunable distribution of nanoscale SiO2 additives without requiring the addition of any flowing aids.

Arising design opportunities are geometrical individualization of structures using the design freedom of AM and the patient-individual design of the load-bearing components employing carbon fiber patch placement. To date, however, full exploitation of these opportunities is a complex recurring task, which requires a high amount of knowledge and engineering effort for design, optimization, and manufacturing. The goal of this study is to make this complexity manageable by introducing a suitable manufacturing strategy for individualized lightweight structures and by developing a digitized end-to-end design process chain, which provides a high degree of task automation. The approach to achieve full individualization uses a parametric model of the structure which is adapted to patients' 3D scans. Moreover, patient data is used to define individual load cases and perform structural optimization. The potentials of the approach are demonstrated on an exoskeleton hip structure. A significant reduction of weight compared to a standard design suggests that the design and manufacturing chain is promising for the realization of individualized high-performance structures.

The aim of the Design for Additive Manufacturing is to provide design opportunities and to enhance workpiece properties taking into account constraints of the process, e.g. kinematics and limitations of print technology. Most AM applications are constrained to three-axis movements limiting the fabrication of workpieceslayer by layer to one fixed building direction only. This causes limitations of strength properties, surface quality and the need of supporting structures. Multi-axis AM enables completely new design possibilities going beyond current optimization and design strategies of conventional AM workpieces. This innovation requires multiple design and manufacturing changes in the internal and external geometry of the workpiece as well as in machine and printing head technology. This paper identifies the requirements and capabilities of multi-axis AM and presents possible solutions to overcome the identified challenges. Preliminary results for multi-axis AM are described on an exemplary workpiece. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

As AM has matured, specific classes of material have become associated with specific AM processes and applications. This paper gathers this information for each of the seven categories of ISO/ASTM AM categories. Polymers, metals, ceramics and composites are considered. Microstructural features affecting AM part properties are listed. Service properties of AM parts are described, including physical, mechanical, optical and electrical properties.

Additive manufactured composites have a wide range of applications in engineering sectors specifically in aerospace structures. In addition to mechanical loads, they are subjected to thermal loads caused by aerodynamic heating. Temperature increases cause changes in material properties, which complicates thermal stress analysis. The thermal loading was simulated with specific boundary conditions similar to the experiments where the sample was placed inside the oven chamber. While for the mechanical (tensile) testing loading, the sample's geometry was created with gripping lines to be in accordance with ASTM D3039 standards for tensile tests used in experimental work and surface traction for the applied load. The highest modulus and strength were achieved from the intact sample while the lowest mechanical modulus and strength were obtained in the sample with heat treatment at prolonged temperature of 145 degrees C. At high temperatures, matrices soften affecting matrix-dominated properties such as transverse and in-plane shear stiffness and strength. A good correlation between the predictive models and experimental results is obtained.

Recently, there have been intense efforts to achieve a fully functional 3D structural electronic device by integrating conductive structures into AM parts. Here, we introduce a simple approach to creating a conductive layer on a polymer AM part by CO2 laser processing. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Raman spectroscopy were employed to analyze laser-induced modifications in surface morphology and surface chemistry. The results suggest that conductive porous graphene was obtained from the AM-produced carbon precursor after the CO2 laser scanning. At a laser power of 4.5 W, the lowest sheet resistance of 15.9 Omega/sq was obtained, indicating the excellent electrical conductivity of the laser-induced graphene (LIG). The conductive graphene on the AM parts could serve as an electrical interconnection and shows a potential for the manufacturing of electronics components. An interdigital electrode capacitor was written on the AM parts to demonstrate the capability of LIG. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and cyclability testing demonstrated good electrochemical performance of the LIG capacitor. These findings may create opportunities for the integration of laser direct writing electronic and additive manufacturing.

On the other hand, additive manufacturing or 3D printing is one of the emerging and fastest growing manufacturing technologies due to its advantages such as design freedom and tool-less production. Nowadays, 3D printing of polymer compounds is mostly limited to manufacturing of solid parts. In this context, a merged foaming and printing technology can introduce a great alternative for the currently used foam manufacturing technologies such as foam injection molding. This perspective review article tackles the attempts taken toward initiating this novel technology to simultaneously foam and print thermoplastics. After explaining the basics of polymer foaming and additive manufacturing, this article classifies different attempts that have been made toward generating foamed printed structures while highlighting their challenges. These attempts are clustered into 1) architected porous structures, 2) syntactic foaming, 3) post-foaming of printed parts, and eventually 4) printing of blowing agents saturated filaments. Among these, the latest approach is the most practical route although it has not been thoroughly studied yet. A filament free approach that can be introduced as a potential strategy to unlock the difficulties to produce printed foam structures is also proposed.

One can realize complex structures with AM that are difficult or impossible to achieve with conventional fabrication techniques. In a recent project, the US Army attempted to demonstrate athermalization of an infrared lens using AM design and manufacturing techniques. The goal was to demonstrate these new techniques in a small-scale prototype lens for a missile application. U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, Aviation and Missile Center teamed with Materials Sciences LLC (MSC) to apply a previously-reported topology-optimization technique [1] to develop an additively manufactured multi-material, opto-mechanical structure. The composite structure was engineered to maintain the location of the detector focal plane at the focus of a lens as it changes with temperature. MSC initially fabricated several prototype lens housings of additively manufactured titanium and cast urethane which failed at the material interfaces during temperature cycling over the intended operational range. MSC is currently conducting fabrication trials with an injection molded thermoplastic polymer to replace the cast urethane. These unfinished prototype feedstocks are being evaluated for structural integrity under temperature cycling. Initial results are promising; but additional fabrication trials are required to produce fully dense feedstocks for finish machining. Composite structures allow tailoring of mechanics to react as designed to temperature and vibration. But it is nearly impossible to model all aspects of a composite structure. Prototyping and testing can quickly reveal limitations of materials and fabrication methods that can inform future optimization efforts. This effort documents these iterations and learned lessons, and presents evidence that this AM-composite technique is useful for designing robust opto-mechanics and that the current manufacturing method can be matured to deliver operational components.

As additive manufacturing (AM) becomes increasingly used for biomaterials and biofabrication, the translation of new, customizable, medical devices to the clinic becomes paramount. Melt processing is therefore a distinguishable group withinAMthat provides an avenue to manufacture scaffolds/implants with a clinical end-point. Three key melt processingAM technologies are highlighted in this review: melt micro-extrusion, selective laser sintering and melt electrospinning writing. The in vivo (including clinical) outcomes of medical devices and scaffolds made with these processes are reviewed. Together, they encompass the meltAMof scaffold architectures with feature sizes and resolutions ranging from 800 nmup to 700 mu m.

Different from the filament winding or fused deposition modeling process in additive manufacture, large-scale formwork is fabricated with layered winding of FRP fabric and simultaneously applying fast cure epoxy resin in the proposed methods. It increases the fabrication speed and material efficiency compared with the typical fabrication process of FRP formworks, and achieved the geometry flexibility from the numerically controlled additive process. The fabrication methods are developed through a series of preliminary tests, exploring the appropriate fabrication parameters, such as the overlapping height of each layer, winding speed, and epoxy resin type. Two additional prototypes addressing geometrical flexibility are also fabricated. Based on the feasibility studies, the article discussed the potential application of this system on a double-skin tubular arch (DSTA) bridge and a tree-like topological optimized column as the future outlook of this method. As developed based on the established construction systems such as CFFTs and DSTAs, not only the proposed system is compatible with current structure and construction system, but it also benefits from combining an off-shelf material with a flexible and accurate programmable robotic process. This research contributes to the scope of additive manufacturing system by targeting the fabrication of nonuniform optimized large-scale structures.

The previous work's filament was 1.75 mm in diameter and made up of 80:20 wt% ABS and cellulose fiber composite. The filament was utilized in a 3D printer to create customizable automotive parts that were developed with CAD software and produced as scaled models. To precisely compare the models, fabrication factors such as layer thickness, printing time and speed, and fill density were evaluated, and the components were printed at 100% fill density. Tensile, flexural, and impact strengths of the filament material were found to be 46%, 25%, and 17% greater than pure ABS composite, respectively. The study also demonstrated that additive manufacturing of customized car parts provided cost and strength benefits compared to conventionally manufactured components.

These products are obtained by extrusion-based 3D printing. The mechanical properties of the obtained specimens are studied by tensile and flexural strength testing with regard to the carbon fiber content. The scanning electron microscopy is used to study the structure of the fracture surface of the tested specimens. The physical-and-mechanical properties of polymer specimens and products produced therefrom are investigated with respect to the different content of carbon fibers. Secondary ABS polymer subjected to natural ageing for 17000 hours is used to prepare the composite material. Described are the production techniques for the composite filament and the filament fabrication process, which is optimum from the viewpoint of achieving the improved properties of physical-and-mechanical properties of the specimens obtained.

By combining the energy absorbing properties of water with polymers, it is possible to significantly improve the time to ignition of AM parts with open internal structures. Theory relating the flame temperature to the maximum wall temperature of WFPs is developed. A range of water-polymer configurations are presented as a basis for WFP designs. Three separate thermal experiments were conducted to test different aspects of the WFPs. The time to ignition for cone calorimetry samples was extended 794% over plain photopolymers. Case studies were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of WFPs with complex shapes. The results of thermo-fluid finite element simulations showed good agreement with experimental observations and provide a useful tool for the evaluation and optimisation of WFP designs. The fire resistance of thin walled structures with internal water volumes was found to be significantly improved. The water filling strategy was found to be more effective than adding intumescent coatings. Finally further work and recommendations are discussed.

In this work, we proposed a vision based measure algorithm with two custom metrics to quantitatively evaluate two typical defects: misalignment and twist, in the ME based CFRP fabrication process. Based on the proposed algorithm and metrics, we explored the effects of four printing parameters on the defects under different path radii for co-extrusion based process with Taguchi method. The experiments illustrate Fibre Feed Rate and Printing Speed have significant influences on fibre misalignment, whereas these parameters only show minor influences on fibre twist. Additionally, it is found that reduced printing radius can introduce more error to the defects, especially for fibre twist. Based on the analysis, optimum conditions for infill path with different curvature radii are proposed and the results of confirmation experiments support the proposed adaptive search method for printing parameters.

Other low molecular weight compounds are formed due to degradation of polymers and additives during synthesis, processing, use and after disposal. Knowledge of these compounds is important for evaluating the environmental impact and interaction of polymeric materials, to investigate long-term properties and degradation mechanisms, to verify ingredients, to investigate manufacturing problems, to quality control polymeric materials, to identify odorants, to avoid workplace exposure and to insure safety of food packaging and medical products. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a solvent-free extraction technique that has in recent years found an increasing number of applications in different fields. This paper presents a review of SPME technique in different polymer related applications including analysis of degradation products and polymer additives, monomer-rests, odor compounds, migrants from food packaging and medical products, extraction of polymer additives from environmental samples and biological fluids.

About 63 vol% of isotropic NdFeB magnet powders were compounded with 37 vol% of polyphenylene sulfide and bonded permanent magnets were fabricated while using Big Area Additive Manufacturing without any degradation in magnetic properties. The polyphenylene sulfide bonded magnets have a tensile stress of 20 MPa, almost double than that of nylon bonded permanent magnets. Additively manufactured and surface-protective-resin coated bonded magnets meet the industrial stability criterion of up to 175 degrees C with a flux-loss of 2.35% over 1000 h. They also exhibit better corrosion resistance behavior when exposed to acidic (pH = 1.35) solution for 24 h and also annealed at 80 degrees C over 100 h (at 95% relative humidity) over without coated magnets. Thus, polyphenylene sulfide bonded, additively manufactured, protective resin coated bonded permanent magnets provide better thermal, mechanical, and magnetic properties.	[Paranthaman, M.

Depending on discovering new materials and techniques, additive manufacturing technologies also develop and become more economical and sustainable technology. The widespread use of this technology in industrial areas has accelerated development and contributed to increased product quality. However, to ensure the development and continuity of this technology, it is necessary to reduce the production costs, increase the quality and accelerate the production processes. These processes also trigger competition and accelerate the development of technology. The areas that additive manufacturing technologies are mostly applied can be grouped as aerospace, biomedical, smart technologies, and other industrial applications. The fact that these areas are popular research areas also accelerates the development of additive manufacturing technologies. In this review, additive manufacturing technologies from past to present, advantages and disadvantages of these technologies, aspects that need to be developed, and industrial applications are examined and explained. When the studies on additive manufacturing technologies and industrial applications are examined, it is seen that this technology has a wide usage area. With the use of additive manufacturing technologies, previously encountered in prototypes and special applications, in automotive, biomedical, and smart technologies, it is seen that they have begun to take place more in people's daily lives.

In terms of sustainability and environmental impact, selection of biobased renewable alternatives instead of petroleum-based options is important. Nanocellulose, which gives plants and trees their structural integrity, can offer significant improvements in the mechanical properties of AM polymers, provided that the right fibril morphology, dispersion and adhesion are achieved. In this study, although the interfacial adhesion between the hydrophilic cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and the hydrophobic polylactate matrix was not strong, and the optimal dispersion in individual fibril level was not attained, dramatic improvements in mechanical properties of neat polymer were achieved (up to 80% tensile strength increase, up to 200% elastic modulus increase). An interlocking reinforcing mechanism in which CNF bundles act as "microsponges" was proposed and supported by high resolution electron microscopy images, x-ray computed chromatography scans and thermal and dynamic mechanical behavior. Additively manufactured samples showed significantly higher elastic modulus (7.12 GPa vs. 6.57 GPa at 30 wt % CNF content) and dramatically improved storage modulus (1.72 GPa vs. 0.9 GPa at 30 wt % CNF content) in the printing direction compared to compression molded samples. In conclusion, preparation and 3D-printing of a 100% biobased renewable feedstock material with substantial mechanical property improvements were successfully demonstrated, which can open up new window of opportunities in the AM industry.

Additive manufacturing (AM) of polyolefins offers both a viable path toward functional prototyping of design concepts and direct manufacturing of end-use parts. Melt-based AM of polyolefins is more challenging than other semicrystalline polymers (polyamides) due to the relatively high levels of volumetric shrinkage encountered during crystallization of such polymers that lead to significant issues related to warpage and interlayer adhesion. The focus of this review is to evaluate the latest state-of-the-art for processing polyolefins by powder bed fusion (PBF) and material extrusion (MatEx) AM modalities. Recent progress in processing neat, filled, and blends of polyolefins using PBF and MatEx are discussed to highlight the importance of the rheological and morphological characteristics of the polymer melt on the printed parts performance. The existing challenges to AM of polyolefins are emphasized and strategies to address the limitations are recommended through a better understanding of the associated process-structure-property relationships. A holistic approach spanning synthetic modifications for feedstock development, improved system design, and physics-guided process parameter selection is required to broadly adopt melt-based AM of polyolefins.

Vanillin, a naturally occurring molecule as well as a derivative easily obtained from biomass, including lignin, can be used as a building block for vinyl ester resins (VERB) and AM-ready materials. A vanillin-based VER, prepared via a 100% atom efficient and solventless technique, was investigated for AM applications due to its low viscosity and demonstrated ability to photopolymerize. The resin was additively manufactured via SLA and the effect of postprocessing after printing was investigated. The extent of cure between the printed and postprocessed samples was found to have the highest effect on polymer properties, increasing extent of cure by approximately 23%. With postprocessing, the printed material was shown to have a glass transition temperature (T-g) of 153 degrees C and Young's modulus of 4900 MPa, comparable to the same resin cured via traditional thermal techniques. This resin system has the potential to be used as a standalone high strength and high T-g material for SLA. Furthermore, the resin system also has potential as a formulation base for tunable SLA cure characteristics and final desired printed polymer properties while retaining significant biobased content.

J	Puttonen, T; Salmi, M; Partanen, J				Puttonen, Tuomas; Salmi, Mika; Partanen, Jouni			Mechanical properties and fracture characterization of additive manufacturing polyamide 12 after accelerated weathering	POLYMER TESTING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Powder bed fusion; Accelerated weathering; Polymer degradation; Mechanical properties; Fracture characterization	MULTI JET FUSION; ALIPHATIC POLYAMIDES; DEGRADATION; POLYMERS; PHOTOOXIDATION; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR; PHOTOCHEMISTRY; MICROSTRUCTURE; EMBRITTLEMENT	The additive manufacturing (AM) methods, selective laser sintering (SLS) and multi jet fusion (MJF), are increasingly used for end-use polymer parts. Chemical reactions caused by ionizing radiation and catalyzed by oxygen, moisture, and heat are known to degrade the polymer structure, result in visual defects, and loss of mechanical properties. However, the effects of the AM layer-wise manufacturing process on polymer degradation are not widely studied. Yet, they may have implications on the mechanical properties and fracture mechanisms of the components. This paper presents an open access data repository of mechanical properties after weathering for AM plastics, conventionally manufactured plastics, and for two clear protective coatings. All materials were exposed to a 1500-h accelerated weathering cycle (ISO-4982-3) followed by tensile testing (ISO-527). Special attention was given to polyamide 12 (PA12) produced via powder bed fusion AM in two build orientations. The fracture surfaces of PA12 and glass-filled PA12 were further studied with scanning electron microscopy. The AM materials were PA12, glass-filled PA12, and carbon reinforced PA12. Traditionally manufactured materials included glass-filled and molybdenum disulfide-filled PA66, PMMA, ABS, PC, and cast PA12. No clear differences were found between the AM build orientations in fracture mechanisms or weathering performance. AM and cast PA12 were strongly affected by accelerated weathering. Carbon reinforced PA12 with a UV varnish experienced the least changes. Weathering resistance was increased with protective coatings. However, an increase in the deviation of mechanical properties with the coatings was observed. The contrary results in ductility for the glass-filled and molybdenum disulfide-filled PA66 after weathering would merit further studies.

These issues are magnified at larger scale, where even a small thermal strain can correspond to several millimeters of deformation. In this work we investigate the thermal evolution in thin walls of carbon fiber/acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (CF/ABS) composite materials fabricated via Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAAM). We measure the thermal evolution of composite parts during the build process using infrared imaging, and develop a simple 1D transient thermal model to describe the build process. The model predictions are in excellent agreement with the observed temperature profiles and from the results we develop criteria to guide deposition parameter selection to minimize the likelihood of cracking during printing.

J	Bartolai, J; Simpson, TW; Xie, RX				Bartolai, Joseph; Simpson, Timothy W.; Xie, Renxuan			Predicting strength of additively manufactured thermoplastic polymer parts produced using material extrusion	RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL			English	Article						Polymers; Mechanical properties; Additive manufacturing; Material extrusion		Purpose - The weakest point in additively manufactured polymer parts produced by material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEAM) is the interface between adjacent layers and deposition toolpaths or roads. This study aims to predict the mechanical strength of parts by utilizing a novel analytical approach. Strength predictions are made using the temperature history of these interfaces, polymer rheological data, and polymer weld theory. Design/methodology/approach - The approach is validated using experimental data for two common 3D-printed polymers: polycarbonate (PC) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). Interface temperature history data are collected in situ using infrared imaging. Rheological data of the polycarbonate and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene used to fabricate the fused filament fabrication parts in this study have been determined experimentally. Findings - The strength of the interfaces has been predicted, to within 10% of experimental strength, using polymer weld theory from the literature adapted to the specific properties of the polycarbonate and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene feedstock used in this study. Originality/value - This paper introduces a novel approach for predicting the strength of parts produced by MEAM based on the strength of interfaces using polymer weld theory, polymer rheology, temperature history of the interface and the forces applied to the interface. Unlike methods that require experimental strength data as a prediction input, the proposed approach is material and build orientation agnostic once fundamental parameters related to material composition have been determined.

Supramolecular tools for polymer additive manufacturing	MRS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							HIGH TOUGHNESS; HIGH-STRENGTH; HYDROGELS; CHEMISTRY; MECHANOPHORE; ELASTOMERS	Advances in additive manufacturing have been mostly driven by developments in software and hardware for 3D printing. However, the limited number of printable polymers still restricts the applications of this technique. Researchers have made progress in the development of advanced polymeric materials that are compatible with 3D printing, by using a wide array of chemical interactions. In this prospective article, we discuss how 3D-printing technology can benefit from a supramolecular toolbox of dynamic covalent and non-covalent bonds. Furthermore, we aim to highlight how this toolbox is helping to overcome the main challenges in processability, functionality, and sustainability for 3D printing.

However, AM techni- ques cannot accurately build parts with large overhangs, especially for the large features close to horizontal, hanging over the void. The overhangs will make the manufactured model deviate from the design model, which will result in the performance of the manufactured model that cannot satisfy the design require- ments. In this paper, we will propose a new finite element (FE) analysis model that includes the manufacturing errors by mimicking the AM layer by layer con- struction process. In such FE model, an overhang coef ficient is introduced to each FE, which is de fined by the support elements in the lower layer. By mimicking the AM process from the bottom layer to the top layer, all the FE properties are updated based on their overhang coef ficients, which makes the computational model be able to predict the manufactured model with manufacturing errors. The proposed model can be used to predict the performance of the AM objects in the design stage, which will help the designers to improve their design by the simulation results.

The qp method is employed to avoid the singularity issue of stress-constrained problems. The P-norm function with stability transformation is adopted to build the global stress constraint with iterative corrections to eliminate the gap between the maximum local stress and the P-norm stress. The Heaviside projection is employed to generate clear-cut 0-1 designs. Two benchmark examples have been studied with the numerical algorithm. Experiments are performed on the topologically optimized MBB beam to investigate the impact of the FDM process parameters, including deposition path direction, building direction, and slicing layer height, on the resulted structural strength. The stress-constrained designs without and with Heaviside projection are comparatively tested with experiments. The stress-minimization designs subject to different P-norm parameters are compared both numerically and experimentally. Experiments show that the deposition path direction and the building direction evidently affect the derived structural strength. Moreover, overthin structural members may severely degrade the structural strength due to manufacturing and loading uncertainties.

This improvement is associated with the growing reliability of AM processes and is driven by a rise in demand from several industries. Large-format additive manufacturing (LFAM), when referring to polymeric extrusion systems, is quite new in the field of AM. The purpose of this paper is to present a review of large-format (those with build volumes over 1 m(3)) fused deposition or extrusion-based AM equipment. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents an exhaustive literature review for all the publications in the field of AM in the current decade, as well as technological coverage in the news, specialized blogs and technology fairs since the year 2015. Findings This review reveals growing scientific and industrial activity, as well as in equipment, in the field of LFAM. An increase in research activity is also occurring in parallel with a growing interest, potential and adaptation of these technologies in certain industries. Originality/value This review may be the first publication to collect the majority of existing information on LFAM for polymeric extrusion systems in terms of applied extrusion technologies, commercial products, specific material research and developments, intellectual property, design and simulation solutions, as well as its practical applications.

Especially powder and beam-based AM processes like selective laser sintering (SLS) of polymers are promising, although the choice of commercial SLS powders is very limited. To further extend the applications of SLS, new and cheap materials with good processability must be supplied. Within this contribution two innovative methods for production of spherical polymer micro particles for SLS are discussed: The first approach is a process chain applicable to a wide range of polymers consisting of wet grinding in a stirred media mill followed by rounding of the obtained irregular-shaped particles in a heated downer reactor and subsequent dry coating of the spherical particles for improvement of powder flowability. It will be outlined for glass-filled PBT systems. The second approach is melt emulsification with subsequent dry coating. In this process a polymer melt is emulsified by elongational and shear stresses in a rotor stator device. The method is exemplified for polypropylene (PP). Both approaches allow for production of spherical polymer micro particles. The effect of flowability, shape and bulk density on the powders' processabilities in SLS is assessed.

This article proposes a characterization approach to further address development of aeronautic secondary structures via 3D-printed composite materials replacing conventional manufactured carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites. Different 3D printing materials, technologies, printing directions, and parameters were investigated. Experimental results showed that carbon-reinforced ONYX_R material exhibits a transition point at 114 degrees C, a 600 MPa tensile strength, and an average tensile strain of 2.5%, comparable with conventional CFRP composites manufactured via autoclave, making it a suitable candidate for replacing CFRP composites, in the aim of taking advantage of 3D printing technologies. ONYX material exhibits higher stiffness than Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene Copolymer (ABS), or conventional Nylon 6/6 polyamide, the flexural modulus being 2.5 GPa; nevertheless, the 27 degrees C determined transition temperature limits its stability at higher temperature. Daylight High Tensile (further called HTS) resin exhibits a tensile strength and strain increase when shifting the printing direction from transversal to longitudinal, while no effect was observed in HighTemp DL400 resin (further called HTP).

Consequently, novel applications for additively manufactured ceramics, which leverage their structural, high temperature, and chemical-resistant properties, have been proposed in areas ranging from electrical engineering and micro/nanoelectronics to chemical engineering to biology. Polymer derived ceramics (PDCs) represent a relatively new class of materials within additive manufacturing. PDCs enable the development of ceramic parts patterned via low-cost polymer 3D printing methods followed by pyrolysis in a high temperature process in which the polymer itself forms a ceramic often in the absence of any ceramic filler. PDCs have served as a feedstock for various 3D printing techniques for which a wide range of physiochemical factors can be tailored to optimize the ceramic manufacturing processes. In particular, the silicon and carbon-rich polymeric microstructure of PDCs offers a high degree of tunability and potential to achieve a closely defined combination of functional, thermomechanical, and chemical properties. In this review, we cover mechanisms underlying the design and manufacture of ceramics via 3D printing and pyrolysis of preceramic polymers, focusing on chemical formulations, printing technologies, and the mechanical performance of the ceramic network from microscale to scale. We also summarize experimental data from the literature and present qualitative and quantitative comparisons between different AM routes to provide a comprehensive review for 3D printing of PDCs and to highlight potential future research.

A wide range of materials, including gels, can be shaped using this method. A gel material is composed of a three-dimensional cross-linked polymer or colloidal network immersed in a fluid, known as hydrogel when its main constituent fluid is water. Hydrogels are capable of absorbing and retaining large amounts of water. Cellulose gel is among the materials that can form hydrogels and, as shown in this work, has the required properties to be directly SAM, including shear thinning and formation of post-shearing gel structure. In this study, we present the developed method of SAM for the fabrication of complex-shaped cellulose gel and examine whether successive printing layers can be completed without delamination. In addition, we evaluated cellulose SAM without the need for support material. Design of Experiments (DoE) was applied to optimize the SAM settings for printing the novel cellulose-based gel structure. The optimum print settings were then used to print a periodic structure with micro features and without the need for support material.

The aim of the paper is the inves-tigation of rheological behaviour of polymer and composite blends regularly used for the production of scaffolds for bone tissue applications with the use of additive manufacturing. Poly-& epsilon;-caprolactone (PCL), hydroxyapatite (HA), b-tri-calcium phosphate (TCP) and Bioglass 45S5 blends containing different ceramic concentrations (10 wt%, 15 wt% and 20 wt%) were prepared with the use of melt blending procedure and investigated with the use of oscil-lation and rotational rheology tests. Results are showing that all blends are presenting viscoelastic behaviour with higher viscous modulus, compared with elastic modulus for low frequencies, with this difference reducing while the frequency is increasing. All blends are presenting shear-thinning behaviour suitable for use with additive manufacturing methods. Viscous and elastic modulus are increasing by adding ceramic particles. Results are presenting that PCL/HA blends of the same material concentration are presenting higher elastic modulus properties compared with the other blends, while PCL/Bioglass blends are presenting lower loss factor, lower relaxation time and lower shear viscosity making them easier to handle during the printing procedure.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

It allows to expand and accelerate human space exploration possibilities. Extrusion-based AM was demonstrated in zero gravity, while the realization of such a process in orbit-like vacuum conditions is currently under exploration. Still, a solution for protection of the UV and IR radiation sensitive polymers is needed in order to prevent their early mechanical failure under space conditions. Vacuum arc plasma based process is widely applied on earth for thin protective coating deposition. Its major advantage is its scalability-from tiny size used in electric propulsion to large scale coating devices. The usability of the vacuum arc process in space conditions was shown in electric propulsion applications in nano-satellites. In this work we discuss and demonstrate the integration of vacuum arc process as a post processing step after Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) for additive manufacturing and functionalization of long polymer structures. Here we address the concept for technical realization, which integrates the vacuum arc into additive manufacturing process chain. More over we present a laboratory prototype, which implements this concept together with a use case, where a previously printed PEEK structure is coated with aluminum based coating suitable for UV radiation protection.

The aim of this study is to properly characterize an additively manufactured polymer with the corresponding process-induced defects. To this effect, varied manufacturing orientations of fused filament fabrication were tested with a single-batch material manufactured by injection molding serving as a reference. Scans were carried out via micro-computed tomography to assess the void content and distribution with respect to quality. Local material performance was investigated via quasi-static and cyclic tests under tensile loading. The quasi-static tensile tests indicated a significant reduction of Young's modulus, tensile strength, and strain at fracture for the additively manufactured polymer. The mechanical investigations with cyclic loading intensified this trend of clear reduced mechanical properties due to process-induced defects. The quality assessment revealed void volume contents of the additively manufactured polymer of up to 6.5% and a void distribution dependent on manufacturing orientation. The results of this study are valuable as design guidelines for highly stressed components and serve as a basis for further characterizations of process-induced defects.

Conventional fabrication methods rely on a mold, which limits specimen geometry and is difficult to implement. In contrast, additive manufacturing, including fused filament fabrication or fused deposition modeling, direct ink writing, or stereolithography, combined with a method to align filler material such as a mechanical force or an electric, magnetic, shear force, or ultrasound wave field, enables 3D printing polymer matrix composite material specimens with complex geometry and aligned filler material, without the need for a mold. Herein, we review the combinations of fabrication and filler material alignment methods used to fabricate polymer matrix composite materials, in terms of operating and design parameters including size, resolution, print speed, filler material alignment time, polymer matrix and filler material requirements, and filler manipulation requirements. The operating envelope of each fabrication method is described and their advantages, disadvantages, and limitations are discussed. Finally, different combinations of 3D printing and filler material alignment methods in the context of important engineering applications, such as structural materials, flexible electronics, and shape-changing materials, are illustrated.

Negative additive manufacturing involves 3D printing of sacrificial molds used for casting negative copies. B4C powder distributions and rheology of suspensions were optimized to successfully cast complex shapes. In addition to demonstrating scalability of these complex geometries, hierarchically meso-porous structures were also shown to be possible from this technique. Resorcinol Formaldehyde (RF) polymer was selected as the gelling agent and can also pyrolyze into a carbon aerogel network to act as the sintering aid for B4C. Due to the highly effective distribution of in situ carbon for the B4C matrix, near-full sintered density of 97-98% of theoretical maximum density was achieved. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The importance of carbon fiber to polymer additive manufacturing	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH			English	Article								Additive manufacturing (AM) holds tremendous promise in terms of revolutionizing manufacturing. However, fundamental hurdles limit the widespread adoption of this technology. First, production rates are extremely low. Second, the physical size of the parts is generally small, less than a cubic foot. Third, the mechanical properties of the polymer parts are generally poor, limiting the potential for direct part replacement and functional use of the polymer components. This article describes various ways in which carbon fibers (CFs) can be used to address these fundamental hurdles. First, CF-reinforced polymers developed for AM have demonstrated specific strengths approaching aerospace-quality aluminum. Second, CF additions can radically reduce the distortion and warping of the material during deposition, which enables large-scale, out-of-the-oven, high deposition rate manufacturing. Finally, the complementary nature of CF technology and AM is discussed, showing how merging the two manufacturing processes enables the construction of complex components that would not be possible with either technology alone.

It gives the ability to manufacture parts with complex geometry, without the need of specific tools. This work focuses on fused filament fabrication process. It consists in melting the polymer, and extruding it through a nozzle to create a structure defined by a toolpath. The extruded filament solidifies while cooling. One of the major drawbacks of this process is the poor mechanical properties of the parts compared to thermoplastic injection. This is related to (i) the porosities between deposited filaments and (ii) the limited adhesion between deposited layers. This adhesion phenomenon is thermally driven by the molecular mobility of the polymer chains. The objective of this work is to understand, model and quantify heat exchanges in the process, in order to define the process window leading to optimal mechanical resistance of the parts. With this aim, a laboratory-scale instrumented 3D printing machine has been designed and manufactured. This bench is thermally controlled. Polymer and environment temperatures can be measured with an infrared camera, pyrometer and thermocouples instrumentation. In parallel, a numerical model has been developed to predict the influence of the process parameters on the cooling and adhesion. For this purpose, thermal properties have been characterized. A sensitivity analysis quantifies the most relevant properties to measure and control accurately and a comparison between numerical and experimental results validates the approach.

However, the polymers-based 3D printings are currently mainly used for prototype or mold printing due to the lack of functional polymer resins. Functional 3D printing has been one of the most important goal of scientific research and industry development. In the present work, we developed the 3D printable resin which allows the printing of 3D structures with photochromic properties, that is, their color can change reversibly with different light irradiation. By using the reversible photochromic properties, we developed the secondary printing technology that allows the printing of multicolor and different color patterns on the as-printed 3D structures. This will be of great importance and indeed for applications in jewelry design, UV indicator, optically modulated sensors, smart windows, display, package indicators, and so on.

Finite element modelling of fully-coupled flow/fiber-orientation effects in polymer composite deposition additive manufacturing nozzle-extrudate flow	COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING			English	Article						Finite element method; Polymer composite deposition additive manufacturing; Non-Newtonian polymer melt flow; Fiber orientation; Die swell	FIBER ORIENTATION; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; OPTIMAL-DESIGN; CARBON-FIBER; DIE SWELL; PART I; EXTRUSION; STATE; SUSPENSIONS	This paper presents a Finite Element Method (FEM) based algorithm to simulate the mutually dependent effects between non-Newtonian polymer melt flow and fiber orientation in Polymer Composite Deposition Additive Manufacturing (PCDAM). The computational approach is employed to analyze an axisymmetric flow with a free surface that defines the melt extrudate. The non-Newtonian power law model is applied to quantify the shear thinning rheological behavior of the polymer flow. The fiber orientation state of the composite melt is simulated using the Advani-Tucker orientation tensor approach, and a streamline-based remeshing technique is applied to compute die swell of the free extrudate. The non-linear FEM system is solved with the Newton Raphson iteration method. Computed results are compared to those obtained using a flow-fiber one way coupling simulation, where it is shown that the magnitude of flow field along the direction of extrusion, as well as the fiber alignment in the flow direction, both increase when full coupling is used. In addition, the extrudate swell ratio solved by the fully-coupled scheme reduces by roughly a factor of similar to 2 x as compared to the weakly-coupled flow solution.

To this end, we present an efficient strengthening method for the ME process by introducing bidirectional in situ infrared (IR) heating during the polymer melt deposition in the 3D-printing process. The auxiliary IR irradiation was applied to heat as-printed polymers in the deposited area along the printing paths at their glass transition temperature, which expectedly led to molecular diffusion and chain re-entanglement at the deposited interface. Consequently, the heating technique not only helped eliminate the structural defects due to the thermal stress but also helped enhance the mechanical strength, particularly of structures layered in transverse and upright directions. The reinforcement effects were confirmed by conducting tensile tests and thermal imaging analysis on typical polymers such as polylactic acid and polycarbonate. The experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed heating technique in extending the applicability of a wide range of engineering plastics or composite materials for the ME printing method.

Selective laser sintering of polyamide powders was used to 3D print a polymeric preform with controlled relative density, which allows manufacturing geometrically complex parts with small features. Preceramic polymer infiltration with a silicon carbide precursor followed by pyrolysis (PIP) was used to convert the preform into an amorphous SiC ceramic, and five PIP cycles were performed to increase the relative density of the part. The final densification was achieved via liquid silicon infiltration (LSI) at 1500 degrees C, obtaining a SiSiC ceramic component without change of size and shape distortion. The crystallization of the previously generated SiC phase, with associated volume change, allowed to fully infiltrate the part leading to an almost fully dense material consisting of beta-SiC and Si in the volume fraction of 45% and 55% respectively. The advantage of this approach is the possibility of manufacturing SiSiC ceramics directly from the preceramic precursor, without the need of adding ceramic powder to the infiltrating solution. This can be seen as an alternative AM approach to Binder jetting and direct ink writing for the production of templates to be further processed by silicon infiltration.

In particular, porosity is considered a crucial aspect of AM products. A prototype system for the deposition of continuous carbon fiber-reinforced polymers with a thermoplastic matrix has been recently developed at Mechanical Engineering Department of Politecnico di Milano. This application is of interest, as it would avoid the expensive development and manufacturing of specific molds. The mechanical performance of the manufactured components depends mainly on porosity and on non-correct adhesion among filaments, even in the case of conventional manufacturing processes. The additive deposition shows even more relevant issues of this kind. Hence the need for a characterization of the process. The conventional approach considers a destructive test to characterize the composite mechanical properties or porosity. The aim of this paper is proposing original approaches to evaluate both porosity and non-correct adhesion by means of X-Ray computed tomography. The method is validated by comparing the porosity with the reference destructive method defined in the ASTM D3171 standard. It is also shown that the amount of defects is correlated to the mechanical properties of the obtained components, thus the approach can be used for a non-destructive evaluation of the manufactured parts.

Additive manufacturing is a material-processing method in which the addition of materials layer by layer creates a three-dimensional object. Unfortunately, it still cannot compete with conventional manufacturing processes, and instead serves as an economically effective tool for small-batch or high-variety product production. Being preformed of composite filaments makes it easiest to print using an FDM 3D printer without or with minimum alteration to the hardware parts. On the other hand, natural fiber-reinforced polymer composite filaments have gained great attention in the market. However, uneven printing, clogging, and the inhomogeneous distribution of the fiber-matrix remain the main challenges. At the same time, kenaf fibers are one of the most popular reinforcements in polymer composites. Although they have a good record on strength reinforcement, with low cost and light weight, kenaf fiber reinforcement PLA filament is still seldom seen in previous studies. Therefore, this review serves to promote kenaf fiber in PLA composite filaments for FDM 3D printing. To promote the use of natural fiber-reinforced polymer composite in AM, eight challenges must be solved and carried out. Moreover, some concerns arise to achieve long-term sustainability and market acceptability of KF/PLA composite filaments.

Unfortunately, users of FFF have limited resources for easily and cost-efficiently characterizing the materials from the ever-expanding polymer filament market. To address this issue, we constructed a low-cost device and measuring procedure based on the pressure drop in the polymer melt flow through an FFF nozzle which is used to compute the filament material rheological properties. In this approach, an analytical pressure drop model based on the Generalized-Newtonian-Fluid power-law model is employed where the consistency and power-law indices are determined from the measured pressure drop and volumetric flow rate through a nonlinear regression curve fit. The applicability of our device was demonstrated with six commercially available FFF filaments (four unfilled polymers and two carbon fiber polymer composites) by comparing the predicted viscosity model parameters to those obtained from measurements using a commercial rotational rheometer. A Filament Flow Index (FFI) capable of characterizing the flow of melted filament similar to Melt Flow Index is also proposed to assess the extrusion of materials used in FFF part fabrication.

Whilst the development and implementation of AM technologies in the ceramic industry has been slower than in the polymer and metal industries, there is now considerable interest in developing AM processes capable of producing defect-free, fully dense ceramic components. A large variety of AM technologies can be used to shape ceramics, but variable results have been obtained so far. Selecting the correct AM process for a given application not only depends on the requirements in terms of density, surface finish, size and geometrical complexity of the part, but also on the nature of the particular ceramic to be processed.

Design and additive manufacture of functionally graded structures based on digital materials	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Digital materials; Functionally graded materials; Voxel printing; Multimaterial jetting; Topology optimization	TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZATION; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; MULTIMATERIAL; PARTS; COMPOSITES	Voxel-based multimaterial jetting additive manufacturing allows fabrication of digital materials (DMs) at the meso-scale (similar to 1 mm) by controlling the deposition patterns of soft elastomeric and rigid glassy polymers at the voxel-scale (similar to 90 mu m). The digital materials can then be used to create heterogeneous functionally graded material (FGM) structures at the macro-scale (similar to 10 mm) programmed to behave in a predefined manner. This offers huge potential for design and fabrication of novel and complex bespoke mechanical structures. This paper presents a complete design and manufacturing workflow that simultaneously integrates material design, structural design, and product fabrication of FGM structures based on digital materials. This is enabled by a regression analysis of the experimental data on mechanical performance of the DMs i.e., Young's modulus, tensile strength and elongation at break. This allows us to express the material behavior simply as a function of the microstructural descriptors (in this case, just volume fraction) without having to understand the underlying microstructural mechanics while simultaneously connecting it to the process parameters. Our proposed design and manufacturing approach is then demonstrated and validated in two series of design exercises to devise complex FGM structures. First, we design, computationally predict and experimentally validate the behavior of prescribed designs of FGM tensile structures with different material gradients. Second, we present a design automation approach for optimal FGM structures. The comparison between the simulations and the experiments with the FGM structures shows that the presented design and fabrication workflow based on our modeling approach for DMs at meso-scale can be effectively used to design and predict the performance of FGMs at macro-scale.

In this work, the mechanical and thermal properties of a multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT)/polyamide 11 nanocomposite for additive manufacturing was evaluated. Well-dispersed PA11/CNT nanocomposite powders were processed successfully by laser sintering. Compared to the pristine PA11, the fracture toughness of the PA11/CNT nanocomposite was enhanced by similar to 54% by incorporating of only 0.2 wt% CNTs. With differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope fractography analysis, the nanostructure and the toughening mechanism which lead to the toughness improvement was well identified and understood.

AM sample preparation is done using vat photo-polymerization and material extrusion with subsequent measurements of thermal conductivity and electrical insulation properties. The main goal herein in addition to material development is the demonstration of manufacturing applicability including usage properties. Use cases are heat sinks for power electronics, which have to be thermally conductive to spread the generated heat and electrically insulating to ensure general functionality and long-term operation.

Improvement of the adhesion in functional NiTi wire/polymer composites made by additive manufacturing	COMPOSITE STRUCTURES			English	Article						Shape memory alloys (SMA); NiTi; Functional hybrid materials; Surface treatment; Arburg plastic freeforming (APF); Additive manufacturing		Additive manufacturing allows the integration of shape memory wires into polymer matrices. Actuators produced in this way offer a wide range of shapes and wire integration appropriate to external loads is feasible. To reach this aim, NiTi wires and a polymer matrix may be co-deposited simultaneously using an Arburg plastic freeformer. The actuator abilities and reliability are largely affected by the load transmission between the NiTi wire and the polymer matrix. Therefore, different surface treatments are investigated to improve the adhesion. The influence of various treatments is quantified by performing pull-out tests and evaluating the surface roughness. The biggest impact on the interfacial shear strength (ISS) was achieved by a laser gas nitration of the wire surface before embedding them in the matrix material. This approach increased the ISS by a factor of 11 compared to the initial state.	[Eyer, P.; Trauth, A.; Weidenmann, K.

This paper introduces two different design potentials, where the combination of AM and CFRP can lead to better and lighter hybrid structures: First, Load Introductions often show complex superimposed loads and therefore lightweight metal alloys become a valuable alternative to CFRP. With AM, load-oriented designs that provide a more continuous introduction of the load into the fibers become possible. Secondly, tooling for complex composite structures is expensive and laborious. Here, inner tooling with AM can offer potentials in the design and development of complex-shaped composite parts. Within this paper, the potentials are highlighted by a case study that consists of the development of a Hydraulically actuated Quadruped robot (HyQ) leg. Based on the case study, the need for fundamental research in the design and processing of structures with AM and CFRP is pointed out in order to pave the way for its use in future high performance technological applications.

Electrochemical enhancement of carbon black-infused poly(lactic acid) filament for additive manufactured electronic applications	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive Manufacturing; Electronics; 3D printing; Electrically Conductive Polymers	NANOTUBES; PULSE	Here we present an electrochemical method to enhance the electrical conductivity of commercially available, carbon-black infused polylactic acid (PLA) for use in material extrusion-based additive manufacturing (MEAM). After fabrication, the carbon-black infused PLA structure was processed in aqueous solutions consisting of either hydrochloric acid (HCl), nitric acid (HNO3), or sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This study examines the effects of acid concentration of the three types of acids, input waveform shape applied during the electrochemical process, waveform amplitude, and the frequency of the waveforms on the bonding of the negatively charged ions to the conductive PLA. We found that inputting a DC square pulse in a 7 M H2SO4 solution yielded a 51% reduction in electrical resistance. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis shows that line width does shift to lower 2 theta values without affecting the D-spacing and the 2 theta peaks decay indicating that the ions introduced through the electrochemical doping process are being diffused into the conductive workpiece. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) showed the presence of sulfur ions located throughout the processed carbon-infused PLA, even at the core. Throughout this study, we found that this electrochemical process can create electrically in-active dead zones that occurs from higher current densities. XRD analysis reveals that peaks in these dead zones move to higher 2 theta, rather than lower 2 theta in the improved areas. This points to a shrinking of the lattice structure and verifies that structural changes are occurring. Electrically improved areas can be utilized in conjunction with electrically in-active dead zones to create conductive areas with insulating zones, mimicking copper traces on a PCB. This electrochemical process provides the opportunity for fused filament fabrication to be used in more electrical applications.

Rheology Effects on Predicted Fiber Orientation and Elastic Properties in Large Scale Polymer Composite Additive Manufacturing	JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES SCIENCE			English	Article						short fiber-reinforced polymer; large-scale additive manufacturing; rheology effect; die swell; fiber orientation; elastic properties		Short fiber-reinforced polymers have recently been introduced to large-scale additive manufacturing to improve the mechanical performances of printed-parts. As the short fiber polymer composite is extruded and deposited on a moving platform, velocity gradients within the melt orientate the suspended fibers, and the final orientation directly affects material properties in the solidified extrudate. This paper numerically evaluates melt rheology effects on predicted fiber orientation and elastic properties of printed-composites in three steps. First, the steady-state isothermal axisymmetric nozzle melt flow is computed, which includes the prediction of die swell just outside the nozzle exit. Simulations are performed with ANSYS-Polyflow, where we consider the effect of various rheology models on the computed outcomes. Here, we include Newtonian, generalized Newtonian, and viscoelastic rheology models to represent the melt flow. Fiber orientation is computed using Advani-Tucker fiber orientation tensors. Finally, elastic properties in the extrudate are evaluated based from predicted fiber orientation distributions. Calculations show that the Phan-Thien-Tanner (PTT) model yields the lowest fiber principal alignment among considered rheology models. Furthermore, the cross section averaged elastic properties indicate a strong transversely isotropic behavior in these composites, where generalized Newtonian models yield higher principal Young's modulus, while the viscoelastic fluid models result in higher shear moduli.

Experimental comparison of photogrammetry for additive manufactured parts with and without laser speckle projection	OPTICAL MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS FOR INDUSTRIAL INSPECTION X	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Optical Measurement Systems for Industrial Inspection X part of the SPIE Optical Metrology Symposium	JUN 26-29, 2017	Munich, GERMANY	SPIE		Photogrammetry; laser speckle; additive manufacturing	SCANNING METHODOLOGY; 3D DIGITIZATION; METROLOGY	In this paper we show that, by using a photogrammetry system with and without laser speckle, a large range of additive manufacturing (AM) parts with different geometries, materials and post-processing textures can be measured to high accuracy. AM test artefacts have been produced in three materials: polymer powder bed fusion (nylon-12), metal powder bed fusion (Ti-6Al-4V) and polymer material extrusion (ABS plastic). Each test artefact was then measured with the photogrammetry system in both normal and laser speckle projection modes and the resulting point clouds compared with the artefact CAD model. The results show that laser speckle projection can result in a reduction of the point cloud standard deviation from the CAD data of up to 101 mu m. A complex relationship with surface texture, artefact geometry and the laser speckle projection is also observed and discussed.	[Sims-Waterhouse, D.; Bointon, P.; Piano, S.; Leach, R.

This area has been expanding rapidly over the last 20 years. It includes several techniques such as selective laser sintering and stereolithography. The range of materials used today is quite restricted while there is a real demand for manufacturing lighter functional parts or parts with improved functional properties. In this article, we summarize recent work performed in this field, introducing new composite materials containing complex metallic alloys. These are mainly Al-based quasicrystalline alloys whose properties differ from those of conventional alloys. The use of these materials allows us to produce light-weight parts consisting of either metal-matrix composites or of polymer-matrix composites with improved properties. Functional parts using these alloys are now commercialized.

Moreover, advances in additive manufacturing (AM) open new perspectives for the next generation of design and manufacturing of composites, which possess spatially digitalized and materialized arrangement of material/structure in a voxel-by-voxel manner. This review examines the work performed in this fast-growing field and elaborates its future perspectives and potentials. Specifically, the polymer AM processes incorporating different types of reinforcements are discussed in terms of mechanism, feedstocks, their advantages, and constraints. Then, the AM-driven designs for polymeric composites on multiscale and for multi-functional applications are emphasized. Further, emerging research topics including digital composites, intelligence/data-driven design approaches, and four-dimensional printing are further addressed with the careful analysis of existing gaps and future research trends. Finally, this review is concluded with an outlook on future research opportunities on AM-fabricated composites from design to fabrication. This review aims to provide a comprehensive guide to the stakeholders who want to utilize or develop an AM process for polymeric composites.

Beyond process-material issues, deposition path planning is one of the major challenges to allow a wide use of these processes using multi-axis machines or robots. Early CAM software solutions dedicated to multi-axis additive manufacturing have been already commercialised. However, few elementary deposition strategies are currently available. In this article, the possibilities of multi-axis deposition and the developments needed to improve deposition path generation are highlighted through the analysis of a hollow half-sphere as a case study. Deposition strategies are experimentally tested on two different robotised polymer deposition systems. Based on the comparison of the trials, the issues related to the portability of technology from a specific machine setup to a different one are discussed. Finally, a framework for future Computer-Aided Multi-Axis Additive Manufacturing (CAMAAM) software is proposed. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

SLS is capable of creating unique, functional parts with little waste and no tooling by using a high-powered laser to selectively melt powdered polymer into desired shapes. This process relies heavily on understanding and controlling the thermodynamics of the polymer melt process. One of the biggest challenges SLS faces is lack of adequate process control, which leads to comparatively high component variations. It has been shown that implementing more advanced laser control techniques enable a higher level of control over the processing temperatures and lead to more uniform components. Currently, there are no commercial options for a laser power controller that allows continuously variable power to be used as a galvanometer system adjusts the laser position. This paper will also discuss the development and implementation of a galvanometer controller solution that works in conjunction with an off-the-shelf unit to enable this crucial functionality and will present results showing that, when applied to the SLS process, a 33 % reduction in thermal variation was achieved.

There are various techniques, including solvent casting, electrospinning, and rotary-jet spinning, which are widely used for the fabrication of cardiac patches from natural, synthetic, or natural/synthetic polymers. However, limited control over the structure of patches and poor reproducibility are some of the drawbacks associated with these fabrication methods. Currently, the development of additive manufacturing 3D bioprinting technology has opened a new avenue for tissue engineering applications. 3D bioprinting techniques allow the fabrication of cardiac patches with a flexible design based on the individual patient's needs to be placed in precise geometries as found in native counterparts. Recent research has focused on the improvement and implementing various functionalities of cardiac patches. Electroconductive, drug delivery, 4D, and shape memory cardiac patches are the most recent advances in cardiac patch manufacturing.

Sustainability issues in laser-based additive manufacturing	LASER ASSISTED NET SHAPE ENGINEERING 6, PROCEEDINGS OF THE LANE 2010, PART 1	Physics Procedia		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Laser Assisted Net Shape Engineering	SEP 21-24, 2010	Erlangen, GERMANY			Sustainability; Additive Manufacturing; Energy; Selective Laser Sintering; Electrolytic Deposition; Nylon; Silicon Carbide	COMPOSITE; NICKEL	Sustainability is a consideration of resource utilization without depletion or adverse environmental impact. In manufacturing, important sustainability issues include energy consumption, waste generation, water usage and the environmental impact of the manufactured part in service. This paper deals with three aspects of sustainability as it applies to additive manufacturing. First is a review of the research needs for energy and sustainability as applied to additive manufacturing based on the 2009 Roadmap for Additive Manufacturing Workshop. The second part is an energy assessment for selective laser sintering (SLS) of polymers. Using polyamide powder in a 3D Systems Vanguard HiQ Sinterstation, energy loss during a build was measured due to the chamber heaters, the roller mechanism, the piston elevators and the laser. This accounted for 95% of the total energy consumption. An overall energy assessment was accomplished using eco-indicators. The last topic is electrochemical deposition of porous SLS non-polymeric preforms. The goal is to reduce energy consumption in SLS of non-polymeric materials. The approach was to mix a transient binder with the material, to create an SLS green part, to convert the binder, and then to remove the open, connected porosity and to densify the part by chemical deposition at room temperature within the pore network. The model system was silicon carbide powder mixed with a phenolic transient binder coupled with electrolytic deposition of nickel. Deposition was facilitated by inserting a conductive graphite cathode in the part center to draw the positive nickel ions through the interconnected porous network and to deposit them on the pore walls. The Roadmap for Additive Manufacturing Workshop was sponsored by the National Science Foundation under Grant CMMI-0906212 and by the Office of Naval Research under Grant N00014-09-1-0558. The electrolytic deposition research was sponsored by the National Science Foundation, Grant CMMI-0926316. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V	[Sreenivasan, R.; Goel, A.; Bourell, D.

The considered polymer melt has an extremely high viscosity, which dominates in its deformation. Mainly considering the viscous effect, we derive analytical expressions of the flat width, compressed depth, bonding width and cross-sectional profile of the filament in four special cases, which have different combinations of extrusion speed, print speed and nozzle height. We further validate the derived relations, using our experimental results on acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), as well as existing experimental and numerical results on ABS and polylactic acid (PLA). Compared with existing theoretical and numerical results, our derived analytic relations are simple, which need less calculations. They can be used to quickly predict the geometries of the deposited strands, including the bonding widths.

However, previous studies have been limited to the design and fabrication of polymers, metals, and alloys, which can allow the retention of the structure at low temperatures. Metamaterials that operate at high temperatures or over large temperature ranges need to be developed. In this study, 3D-architected ceramic metamaterials with programmable thermal expansion, which can be used in high-temperature or large-temperature-range environments, were designed, fabricated, and characterized. First, three multi ceramic quadrangular-pyramid-structured metamaterials with programmable thermal expansion behaviors were proposed and designed based on ZrO2 and Al2O3 ceramics. The design mechanism and programmable range of thermal expansion were analyzed. Then, 3D-architected ceramic metamaterials with negative (-10 x 10(-6)/degrees C), zero (0 x 10(-6)/degrees C), and positive (+10 x 10(-6)/degrees C) thermal expansion were designed and fabricated through stereolithography additive manufacturing. The manufactured 3D-architected multi-ceramic meta materials with programmable thermal expansion behaviors were analyzed using a digital image correlation (DIC) method. The results showed that the experimentally measured values were in good agreement with the theoretical values. The obtained findings pave the way for the application of 3D-architected multi-ceramic metamaterials.

The purpose of this article is to summarize the research done to date, to highlight successes in the field, and to identify opportunities that the union of AM and nanotechnology could bring to science and technology. Design/methodology/approach - Research in which metal, ceramic, and carbon nanomaterials have been incorporated into AM technologies such as stereolithography, laser sintering, fused filament fabrication, and three-dimensional printing is presented. The results of the addition of nanomaterials into these AM processes are reviewed. Findings - The addition of nanostructured materials into the printing media for additive manufacturing affects significantly the properties of the final parts. Challenges in the application of nanomaterials to additive manufacturing are nevertheless numerous. Research limitations/implications - Each of the AM methods described in this review has its own inherent limitations when nanoparticles are applied with the respective printing media. Overcoming these design boundaries may require the development of new instrumentation for successful AM with nanomaterials. Originality/value - This review shows that there are many opportunities in the marriage of AM and nanotechnology. Promising results have been published in the application of nanomaterials and AM, yet significant work remains to fully harness their inherent potential. This paper serves the purpose to researchers to explore new nanomaterials-based composites for additive manufacturing.

Some of the common additive manufacturing processes include fused filament fabrication, vat photopolymerization, powder bed fusion, binder jetting, and material jetting. In this paper, the authors discuss the use of (i) binder jetting technology to fabricate sand molds for casting complex, cellular structures and (ii) fused filament fabrication & vat photopolymerization to produce complex investment casting patterns. Binder jetting of foundry sand molds allows the realization of cast structures that are impossible to mold using conventional methods. The structures are lightweight, multi-functional and may provide exceptional blast protection. With regards to investment casting, wax is currently the primary material used for producing expendable patterns due to a desirable combination of thermal expansion, thermal conductivity and melting point. However, wax is not a typical printed material. A variety of polymers are available for additive manufacturing and, as would be expected, only a few are suitable for use as expendable patterns for investment casting. The best polymers for use as expendable patterns for investment castings are PMMA, epoxy resin containing a reactive diluent and ABS.

J	Garino, S; Antonaci, P; Pastrone, D; Sangermano, M; Maggi, F				Garino, Simone; Antonaci, Paola; Pastrone, Dario; Sangermano, Marco; Maggi, Filippo			Photo-polymerization for additive manufacturing of composite solid propellants	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA			English	Article						Composite solid propellant; Polymer binder; HTPB; PBDDA; Photopolymerization; Additive manufacturing	DIISOCYANATE	The established state-of-the-art for composite solid propellant grain manufacture consists in mix-cast-cure process using hazardous chemicals and specific molds for propellant forming. In most of the cases, polyaddition of oligomers involves isocyanate functional groups. Construction constraints limit the feasibility of propellant geometries, confining the pressure-time history of rocket motors to some established configurations. Composition pot-life becomes one of the most important parameters in the definition of correlated industrial processes. An additive manufacturing process for propellant grain production based on UV curing has been recently proposed for patenting. This technique enables more complex grain geometries, paving the way for new propulsive missions, thanks to customized thrust-time profiles or local composition fine tuning. The new curative method makes innovative use of pre-polymers, replacing isocyanates with UV-sensitive components characterized by lower chemical hazard for operators. The paper illustrates the experimental results obtained during the preliminary test campaign on propellant inert simulators, produced as lab-scale proof of concept. The activity targeted mono-layer samples, focusing on binder properties. Dynamic-mechanical thermal analysis, thermal-gravimetric analysis, and stress-strain tests have been carried out to measure mechanical and physical characteristics of different formulations. Both hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) and polybutadiene diacrylate (PBDDA) binders have been considered, using ammonium sulfate as substitute of ammonium perchlorate. Aluminized and non-aluminized samples have been manufactured to evaluate the impact of opaque-reflective materials during the UV curing process. The reported analyses show comparable results for both the new UV-cured materials and demonstrate the feasibility of propellants based on isocyanate-free process.

The manufactured scaffolds could be suitable for tissue engineering research. Objectives: To design novel trachea scaffold prototypes for tissue engineering purposes, and to fabricate them by additive manufacturing. Methods: A commercial 3D model and CT scans of a middle-aged man were obtained for geometrical observations and measurements of human trachea. Model trachea scaffolds with variable wall thickness, interconnected pores, and various degrees of porosity were designed. Photocurable polycaprolactone (PCL) polymer was used with 3D photocuring technology. Thermoplastic polylactide (PLA) and PCL were used with FDM. Cell cultivations were performed for biocompatibility studies. Results: Scaffolds of various sizes and porosities were successfully produced. Both thermoplastic PLA and PCL and photocurable PCL could be used effectively with additive manufacturing technologies to print high-quality tubular porous biodegradable structures. Optical microscopic and SEM images showed the viability of cells. The cells were growing in multiple layers, and biocompatibility of the structures was shown.

By using dry powder based process, solvent and drying process used in conventional battery process can be removed which allows large-scale Li-ion battery production be more economically viable in markets such as automotive energy storage systems. Thermal activation time has been greatly reduced due to the time and resource demanding solvent evaporation process needed with slurry-cast electrode manufacturing being replaced by a hot rolling process. It has been found that thermal activation time to induce mechanical bonding of the thermoplastic polymer to the remaining active electrode particles is only a few seconds. By measuring the surface energies of various powders and numerical simulation of powder mixing, the powder mixing and binder distribution, which plays a vital role in determining the quality of additive manufactured battery electrodes, have been predicted and compared favorably with experiments.

Using this in situ mixing strategy, we print polyimide and barium titanate (BaTiO (3)) nanocomposite films with variable levels of ceramic loading. This is accomplished with multimaterial aerosol jet printing. The relative dielectric constant and loss tangent of these composite materials are characterized using two ring resonator circuits designed for the first resonance below 12 and 110 GHz, respectively. This yields material characterization results from the X-band to the W-band. We use these results to estimate the ceramic loading by volume in the composites. In addition, we use scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to characterize the dispersion and ceramic loading of the composite films. Using this process, we demonstrate a range of relative dielectric constants from 3.1 to 8.9. To demonstrate the capabilities of this process, a continuous gradient of material is also shown in a printed film. Finally, we demonstrate a slightly modified process in order to lower the loss characteristics of the printed films to provide insight into the loss mechanisms. By mixing composites in situ, we are able to dynamically alter the ceramic loading of the printed material without formulating multiple inks and pattern 3-D structures without the use of photosensitive materials. This allows us to manufacture material gradients and patterns that would otherwise be impractical to fabricate using conventional microfabrication. Using composite mixing in place adds a new dimension to the flexibility and capability of AM.

Material Extrusion-Based Additive Manufacturing with Blends of Polypropylene and Hydrocarbon Resins	ACS APPLIED POLYMER MATERIALS			English	Article						additive manufacturing; semicrystalline polymers; polypropylene; crystallinity; mechanical properties	HIGH-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE; NATURAL TERPENE RESINS; ISOTACTIC POLYPROPYLENE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; TENSILE PROPERTIES; THERMAL-BEHAVIOR; IMPACT STRENGTH; PHASE-STRUCTURE; CRYSTALLIZATION; COMPOSITES	Filament-based material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEAM) is one of the most commonly used techniques in additive manufacturing (AM). In spite of recent notable development in the MEAM process, there is still a need to develop more materials that can be printed consistently using this technique. Isotactic polypropylene (PP), a popular thermoplastic material, undergoes rapid crystallization and subsequent volume contraction. This can lead to residual stress buildup in PP parts when processed using MEAM, resulting in poor adhesion to the printing platform, poor geometric tolerance, and mechanical performance. In this work, the effects of varying composition of low molecular weight hydrocarbon resins incorporated to PP are investigated. Specifically, the thermal behavior, crystallization, morphology, and printability of the blends are studied. The rapid crystallization of PP has been delayed by the addition of hydrocarbon resins that provided a larger time window for the residual stresses to relax. The addition of the resins to the pure PP matrix lowers the crystallization temperature of PP from 121.8 to 116.0 degrees C, which further enables additional diffusion during the solidification process. Polarized optical microscopy demonstrates the differences in crystalline morphology, which is expected to impact the structure at the interlayer boundaries between deposited layers. The combination of modifications in crystallization rate, time, and morphology significantly affects the interlayer adhesion and residual stress state, which directly controls the mechanical properties and part warpage of printed parts. Tensile bars of the different blends were printed in two different orientations to analyze the mechanical performance and study part anisotropy. The maximum tensile stress of pure PP (26.8 +/- 2.1 MPa) printed at a +/- 45 degrees raster angle increased with addition of 20 wt % hydrocarbon resin (32.4 +/- 3.0 MPa) when printed under the same conditions. The improvement in the tensile strength is due to a combination of changes in crystallinity, morphology, and improved interlayer adhesion during printing. The parts were annealed postprinting to improve polymer chain diffusion across the layers, thereby improving interlayer adhesion and resulting in tensile modulus and strength values in excess of 90% of injection-molded PP parts.

Numerical analysis of screw swirling effects on fiber orientation in large area additive manufacturing polymer composite deposition	COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING			English	Article						Large area additive manufacturing; Swirling motion; Non-Newtonian viscoelastic flow; Reduced strain closure model	CLOSURE APPROXIMATIONS; SUSPENSIONS; STIFFNESS; BEHAVIOR; GEOMETRY; EQUATION	Large Area Additive Manufacturing (LAAM) polymer deposition employs a single screw extruder to deliver pelletized feedstock resulting in significantly higher flow rates as compared to conventional filament-based extrusion additive processes. Swirling kinematics in LAAM melt flow that result from the screw rotation generate unique particle alignment patterns within the fiber-filled polymer during deposition processing. This paper investigates the effect of the single screw swirling motion on the resulting fiber orientation in a short fiber polymer composite extrudate. An axisymmetric non-Newtonian viscoelastic flow is simulated with the finite element method, where the flow nearby the extruder screw tip, within the printing nozzle, and a short section of free extrudate compose the flow domain. Fiber orientation tensors within the flow domain are evaluated using the Wang-O'Gara-Tucker Reduced Strain Closure (RSC) fiber orientation diffusion model with the orthotropic fitted closure. The results indicate that swirling kinematics yield a longer flow path for fibers to travel and orientate within the flow domain, yielding orientation tensor results that are notably different as compared to a non-swirl event. The predicted principal elastic constant from the swirling flow and non-swirling flow models exhibit 21% difference, and those from the swirling model using the RSC closure shows a good agreement with reported experimental data for a similar material system.

However, the full application of these technologies to industrial manufacturing has to be supported by the study of the AM materials' properties and their correlations with the feedstock and the building conditions. Furthermore, nowadays, only a limited number of materials processable by AM are available on the market. It is, therefore, fundamental to widen the materials' portfolio and to study and develop new materials that can take advantage of these unique building processes. The present special issue collects recent research activities on these topics.

The authors have highlighted the potential research gap that can be explored in the current field of study. Three-dimensional (3D) printing is an additive manufacturing technique that uses metallic powder, ceramic or polymers to build simple/complex parts. The parts produced possess good strength, low weight and excellent mechanical properties and are cost-effective. Therefore, efforts have been made to make the adoption of 3D printing successful in space so that complex parts can be manufactured in space. This saves a considerable amount of both time and carrying cost. Thereof the challenges and opportunities that the space sector holds for additive manufacturing is worth reviewing to provide a better insight into further developments and prospects for this technology. Design/methodology/approach The potentiality of 3D printing for the manufacturing of various components under space conditions has been explained. Here, the authors have reviewed the details of manufactured parts used for zero-gravity missions, subjected to onboard international space station conditions and with those manufactured on earth. Followed by the major opportunities in 3D printing in space which include component repair, material characterization, process improvement and process development along with the new designs. The challenges like space conditions, availability of power in space, the infrastructure requirements and the quality control or testing of the items that are being built in space are explained along with their possible mitigation strategies. Findings These components are well comparable with those prepared on earth which enables a massive cost saving. Other than the onboard manufacturing process, numerous other components as well as a complete robot/satellite for outer space applications were manufactured by additive manufacturing. Moreover, these components can be recycled onboard to produce feedstock for the next materials. The parts produced in space are bought back and compared with those built on earth. There is a difference in their nature, i.e. the flight specimen showed a brittle nature, and the ground specimen showed a denser nature. Originality/value This review discusses the advancements of 3D printing in space and provides numerous examples of the applications of 3D printing in space and space applications. This paper is solely dedicated to 3D printing in space. It provides a breakthrough in the literature as a limited amount of literature is available on this topic. This paper aims at highlighting all the challenges that additive manufacturing faces in the space sector and also the future opportunities that await development.

By digital slicing of CAD, 3D scan, or tomography data, AM builds objects layer by layer without the need for molds or machining. AM enables decentralized fabrication of customized objects on demand by exploiting digital information storage and retrieval via the Internet. The ongoing transition from rapid prototyping to rapid manufacturing prompts new challenges for mechanical engineers and materials scientists alike. Because polymers are by far the most utilized class of materials for AM, this Review focuses on polymer processing and the development of polymers and advanced polymer systems specifically for AM. AM techniques covered include vat photopolymerization (stereolithography), powder bed fusion (SLS), material and binder jetting (inkjet and aerosol 3D printing), sheet lamination (LOM), extrusion (FDM, 3D dispensing, 3D fiber deposition, and 3D plotting), and 3D bioprinting. The range of polymers used in AM encompasses thermoplastics, thermosets, elastomers, hydrogels, functional polymers, polymer blends, composites, and biological systems. Aspects of polymer design, additives, and processing parameters as they relate to enhancing build speed and improving accuracy, functionality, surface finish, stability, mechanical properties, and porosity are addressed. Selected applications demonstrate how polymer-based AM is being exploited in lightweight engineering, architecture, food processing, optics, energy technology, dentistry, drug delivery, and personalized medicine. Unparalleled by metals and ceramics, polymer-based AM plays a key role in the emerging AM of advanced multifunctional and multimaterial systems including living biological systems as well as life-like synthetic systems.

J	Miclette, O; Côté, R; Demers, V; Brailovski, V				Miclette, Olivier; Cote, Raphael; Demers, Vincent; Brailovski, Vladimir			Material extrusion additive manufacturing of low-viscosity metallic feedstocks: Performances of the plunger-based approach	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Material extrusion additive manufacturing with highly-filled polymers (MEAM-HP); Additive manufacturing; 3D-printing; Metallic powder; Binder; Feedstock	POWDER; DEPOSITION; PARTS; FABRICATION; SYSTEM; FLOW; WAX	In recent years, increasing attention has been directed at the material extrusion additive manufacturing of highly-filled polymers (MEAM-HP). This is because conventional polymer 3D printers, which are low cost and readily available, can easily be adapted for use with metal powder-filled polymer filaments. However, fabricating the latter is time-consuming and their formulations differ from regular metal injection molding (MIM) feedstocks by lower powder solids loadings and higher elastomer contents, thus requiring significant efforts to optimize their debinding and sintering conditions. Favorably, other types of MEAM-HP printers, such as screw- and piston-based ones, can process available MIM feedstocks and apply the debinding and sintering procedures that have already been optimized. In this study, a novel ram extruder-based printer with a 100 mm-diameter -250 mm-high build volume was developed to print a low-viscosity MIM feedstock composed of 65% of 17-4PH powder, 23 % of paraffin wax, 10% of ethylene vinyl acetate and 2 % of stearic acid (all in vol%). The printer calibration and the process optimization procedures are detailed herein. The kinematic accuracy of the build platform revealed a maximum deviation of 29 and 92 mu m in the vertical (Z) and horizontal (XY) directions, respectively. Prior to printing, a relative feedstock density of 99.8 % was obtained using a one-minute degassing procedure. During printing, a 52.5 degrees C build platform temperature was used and an 85 degrees C extrusion temperature conferred to the feedstock a viscosity of 142 Pas at a shear strain rate of 180 s(-1) (empty set0.4 mm E3D V6 nozzle, 1 mm(3)/s flow rate). Indirect measurements of the extrusion pressure using a load cell positioned under the piston allowed to maximize the accuracy of start/stop extrusion sequences by adjusting the retraction volumes. An overlap printing path technique was introduced to eliminate typical MEAM voids between printed lines. Finally, six parts exhibiting complex geometries were printed to validate the capacity of the printer to produce functional components using conventional low-viscosity MIM feedstocks.

Due to their low price, ease of manufacture, resistance to water and versatility, polymers have several applications in different domestic and industrial sectors. Digital fabrication technology which is also referred to as 3D printing or additive Manufacturing (AM) is used for creating physical components from a geometrical representation by step-by-step addition of materials. This review paper elaborates on the use of polymers for Rapid Manufacturing. One such material used is Shape Memory Polymers that have been analyzed as Smart Materials (4D Printing Materials). Polymers such as Thermoplastics, elastomers, thermosets, and polymers with integrated fillers, bio-polymers, and polymers blended with biological materials come under the range of other polymeric materials used in AM. The quality evaluations that are performed are based on mechanical properties, part density and temperature stability. Polycarbonates (PC), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polyether-ester ketone (PEEK), polyetherimide (ULTEM) and Nylon are usually utilized polymers in measures which need thermoplastics, or plastics treated by warming to a semi-fluid state and near the softening point. Properties of materials were reviewed for example, Strength parameters of a specific list of Polymeric Materials used in 3D printing was revised, where strength tests showed that material such as Polybutylene terephthalate has a high Yield Strength and Polypropylene has a high Ultimate Tensile Strength. Special characteristics such as Water Solubility, Shape Memory and Corrosion Resistance were reviewed for the ability to choose the ideal material for its application. Impact on the Society, Environment and Economy, of 3D printing plastics was brushed up from previous surveys in order to understand the necessity of growth of this industry. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Rapid prototyping of high-performance flexible sensors has become an important method to develop flexible sensors. The purpose of this study was to develop a flexible resin with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) for the rapid fabrication of flexible sensors using digital light processing additive manufacturing. In this study, MWCNTs were mixed in thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) photosensitive resin to prepare polymer-matrix composites, and a flexible strain sensor was prepared using self-developed additive equipment. The results showed that the 1.2 wt% MWCNTs/TPU composite flexible sensor had high gauge factor of 9.988 with a linearity up to 45% strain and high mechanical durability (1000 cycles). Furthermore, the sensor could be used for gesture recognition and monitoring and has good performance. This method is expected to provide a new idea for the rapid personalized forming of flexible sensors.

Influence of raster orientation on the determination of fracture properties of polypropylene thin components produced by additive manufacturing	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED FRACTURE MECHANICS			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Essential work of fracture; Raster orientation; Polymer	FUSED-FILAMENT-FABRICATION; ESSENTIAL WORK; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; CHAIN ORIENTATION; POLYMER; BEHAVIOR; CRYSTALLIZATION; TECHNOLOGIES; DEFORMATION; PERFORMANCE	Additive manufacturing techniques are increasingly being used to produce components in different sectors, including industrial, aeronautical, education and medical applications. In order to predict the mechanical behaviour of these components, it is necessary to characterise materials according to their manufacturing process. Considering the technology of additive manufacturing by "fused filament fabrication" (FFF) or "fused deposition modelling" (FDM), and specifically in "material extrusion additive manufacturing" (ME-AM), several parameters must be defined to produce the required geometries. The infill orientation is one of the parameters that most affects mechanical and fracture properties of the final components, often causing premature failures. Therefore, the objective of this work is to study the influence of raster orientation on fracture parameters for thin polymer components. For this purpose, double deeply edge-notched tensile (DDEN-T) thin specimens have been tested considering the essential work of fracture (EWF) approach. The studied material has been polypropylene (PP). Experimental results show the influence of filament orientation on the essential work of fracture and the limitations of the EWF approach for some of the assessed orientations. Additionally, two different fracture mechanisms have been observed and discussed. This work demonstrates the importance of optimising the raster orientation during the filament deposition layer by layer, depending on the application of the manufactured component, to preserve its structural integrity.

In this work, lattices based on triply periodic minimal surfaces were produced by polymer additive manufacturing and examined with a combination of experimental and computational methods. This investigation elucidates their deformation mechanisms and provides numerical parameters crucial in establishing relationships between their geometries and mechanical performance. Three types of lattice were examined, with one, known as the primitive lattice, being found to have a relative elastic modulus over twice as large as those of the other two. The deformation process of the primitive lattice was also considerably different from those of the other two, exhibiting strut stretching and buckling, while the gyroid and diamond lattices deformed in a bending dominated manner. Finite element predictions of the stress distributions in the lattices under compressive loading agreed with experimental observations. These results can be used to create better informed lattice designs for a range of mechanical and biomedical applications. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Maskery, I.; Aremu, A.

Mechanical properties of hexagonal lattice structures fabricated using continuous liquid interface production additive manufacturing	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Architectured materials; Additive manufacturing; Lattice; Honeycomb	TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZATION; BEHAVIOR	Additive manufacturing (AM) is a key enabler for architectured lattice materials, because of the geometric complexity of parts that can be produced. Recent advancements in AM have enabled rapid production speeds, high spatial resolution, and a variety of engineering polymers. An open question remains whether production grade AM can accurately and repeatably produce lattice parts. This study presents design, production, and mechanical property testing of hexagonal lattice parts manufactured using continuous liquid interface production (CLIP) based AM. We printed and tested 84 parts, in three polymer materials having relative density ranging from 0.06 to 0.23. Lattice wall structures were reliably printed when truss aspect ratio was in the range 5 to 20 and wall thicknesses were 0.35 or 0.5 mm. The printed lattice parts, each comprising hundreds of slender walls, were measured using high resolution optical scanning. The images were analyzed to evaluate the difference between the printed parts and their designs, and the effect of geometric deviations on the mechanical behavior. The measured elastic moduli of the printed parts are close to the values expected from the materials specifications. The measured strength of the printed parts deviates by 7% from the behavior predicted from the scanned geometry. The failure mode of the printed structures depends upon the material and part geometry. To our knowledge, this is the largest study on the accuracy and performance of AM lattice parts, and the first study of its type for lattice parts made using CLIP.

As the use of support structure is generally not appropriate when printing at these scales, understanding the limits of overhanging feature angles is necessary to establish the economic case for using large 3D printing. Additionally, understanding the physics of the process is paramount to avoiding expensive failed prints. Rapid sequential layers can result in slumping as the structure retains excessive heat when the next layer is printed. In this study, the thermal profiles of large printed parts have been experimentally measured and mathematically modeled in order to assist in the decision of whether a delay between layers is required to avoid slumping of overhanging features. The model can be used to insert additional dwell times after each layer so that the next layer of printing initiates after the previous layer is sufficiently cool such that the existing structure is appropriately solidified. Inputs to the model include the feedstock material, the number of beads in the overhanging wall, the angle of overhang and the threshold of failure represented as out-of-plane displacement from the intended geometry. The proposed thermal model can then be used with slicing software to insert pauses a priori, or can be leveraged during the print in conjunction with infrared imaging in order to provide in situ process control to improve quality and yield.

The process is composed of aerosol jet multi-material deposition followed by laser-assisted stereolithography in an alternating fashion to fabricate multi-material three-dimensional objects. The layer-wise dynamic tuning of the refractive index provides the possibility to fabricate optics with tailored index profiles. The index range achieved by the presented approach is considerably higher than the common index tuning techniques. Using this technique, a planar multilayer STIN lens is fabricated. The index profile of the fabricated lens has similar progression to the designed profile. In addition, through simulation and also optical characterization, the lensing functionality of the structure is observed.

Samples from three fiber-filled amorphous thermoplastic materials 3D printed using a Masterprint 3X machine from Ingersoll Machine Tools were studied, along with their neat counterparts. Characterization techniques included thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA). TGA results showed that the fillers decreased the degradation temperature for most of the materials investigated, with a 30 degrees C decrease for polycarbonate (PC) and a 12 degrees C decrease for polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG). For all the materials used, heat capacity increases with increasing temperature. Moreover, results show that a highly conductive filler increases the heat capacity. In contrast, a material with a lower conductivity decreases the heat capacity indicated in the 15.2% and 2.54% increase for acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and PC and a 27.68% decrease for PETG. The TMA data show that the printed bead exhibits directional properties consistent with an orthotropic material. Smaller strains and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) were measured along the bead direction and across the bead compared to the through bead thickness showing that fillers are predominantly oriented in the bead direction, which is consistent with the literature. CTE values through bead thickness and neat material are similar in magnitude, which corresponds to the CTE of the matrix material. The experimental results serve to characterize the effect of fiber filler on the part thermal strains in three principal directions and two-part locations during the extrusion and bead deposition of large-format polymer extrusion-based additive manufacturing technologies.

In the industry and laboratories, quality controls of these objects have to be fulfilled. But these quality controls are challenging compared to classical methods of fabrication because of very complex object manufacturing, unachievable with standard tools. Consequently, we demonstrate terahertz (THz) imaging as an efficient method and THz tomography may be considered as a routine control. This paper proposes an experimental study of 3D polymer objects obtained by additive manufacturing techniques. This approach allows us to characterize defects and to control dimensions by volumetric measurements on 3D data reconstructed by tomography.	[Perraud, J.

Additive manufacture enables custom phantom manufacture, however there exist technical challenges, namely the lack of specialised materials to mimic radiation interaction properties of natural materials, and a lack of automated methods to reduce the manual effort required to convert medical scan data into an additive component. This work demonstrates a novel approach to overcome these challenges to enable the automated manufacture of customised radiation dosimetry phantoms using commercial ultraviolet cured printers.

The ECAM fabrication of polypyrrole entails the electrochemicalpolymerization of pyrrole monomers and additive manufacturing of polymers.Herein, we investigate the 2-naphthalene sulfonic acid sodium salt(NSA-a), sodium naphthalene-2,6-disulfonate (NSA-b), and 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzenedisulfonicacid disodium salt (Tiron) as anionic dopants for the ECAM processingof polypyrrole. The analysis of the dopants, encompassing the electrochemicaltests and electron microscopy measurements coupled with energy-levelcalculations, provides an insight into the influence of their structureand functional groups on polypyrrole depositions. The increase inthe charge/mass ratio of the dopant results in lower deposition potential,higher deposition rate, and reduced particle agglomeration. Atomicforce microscopy tests reveal that the employment of Tiron demonstratesimproved deformation tolerance with stronger adhesion due to the chelatingproperties. The high electronic conductivity of Tiron-doped polypyrroleis attributed to multiple -SO3 (-) groups, which enhance the interchain mobility of charge carriers.Tiron-doped polypyrrole micropillars are successfully produced viapulling of the meniscus. The findings present an opportunity for theoptimization and engineering of ECAM fabrications.

The problem of selecting rational compositions with the aim of improving the manufacturability (extrudability) of UHMWPE was solved. It is shown that extrudable 3D-printed UHMWPE composites over their tribomechanical properties (wear resistance, friction coefficient, elastic modulus, yield point, tensile strength, and elongation at break) exceed those of the hot pressing fabricated composite. This is related to more uniform ordered permolecular structure formation with increased crystallinity. It is shown that the composite "UHMWPE + 20 wt.% PP" is the most efficient from the standpoint of maintaining high tribomechanical properties and possessing acceptable melt flow rate (MFR) index.

Without a doubt, AM is experimenting with significant progress due to technological innovations that are currently advancing. In this context, the state-of-the-art considers both research areas as working separately and contributing to developing the different AM technologies. First, AM techniques' advantages and current limitations are analyzed and discussed. A detailed overview of the efforts made to improve the two most extensively employed techniques, i.e., material extrusion and VAT-photopolymerization, is presented. Aspects such as the part size, the possibility of producing parts in a continuous process, the improvement of the fabrication time, the reduction of the use of supports, and the fabrication of components using more than one material are analyzed. The last part of this review complements these technological advances with a general overview of the innovations made from a material perspective. The use of reinforced polymers, the preparation of adapted high-temperature materials, or even the fabrication of metallic and ceramic parts using polymers as supports are considered. Finally, the use of smart materials that enable the fabrication of shape-changing 3D objects and sustainable materials will also be explored.

The advances in additive manufacturing has led to the development of essential technological innovations with state-of-the-art research prospectus which facilitates the development of parts that are complex to manufacture using other manufacturing technologies. The current paper aims to provide a review of the process characteristics of additive manufacturing techniques and the dimensional accuracy related to the parts manufactured. Several materials are considered for additive manufacturing of engineering components. In this regard, the field of additive manufacturing is gaining importance and has lot of prospects for evaluating its characteristics. The domain of product development has gained wide scope in its role for process optimization and has evolved into a major research area. Thus, an attempt has been made to review the research gap and identift the key field of metal additive manufacturing. This can help in understanding the application of parameters and its subsequent optimization is important in reviewing the process of additive manufacturing in Al-Si-Mg alloys.

J	Jayant, HK; Arora, M				Jayant, Hemang Kumar; Arora, Manish			Droplet-on-demand metal additive manufacturing using a magnetostrictive actuator	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES			English	Article						Droplet -on -demand; Metal additive manufacturing; Magnetostrictive actuator; Metal droplet -on -demand	DEPOSITION; SUBSTRATE	The molten metal droplet-on-demand (MMDoD) mechanism is one of the many advanced ways to achieve metal additive manufacturing (AM). A novel MMDoD mechanism is designed and developed using a magnetostrictive actuator to achieve a desktop-based metal AM system using a low input voltage circuit. The MMDoD mechanism further includes the use of a thermally insulating piston to protect the actuator from the heat of the molten metal pool. The oscillation of the piston in the MMDoD mechanism is used to generate the molten metal droplets. To generate reproducible molten metal droplets with the least geometrical variations, the effect of the input signal pulse shape, the input signal voltage amplitude, and stand-off distance between piston and nozzle entrance on the MMDoD mechanism performance is studied using high-speed videography. The input signal pulse shape is selected to be either the unfiltered signal (UFS) and low pass filtered signal (LPFS). Using UFS and LPFS, a parametric study of molten metal droplets size and its variation is conducted by varying the stand-off distance between the piston and nozzle and input signal voltage amplitude across the magnetostrictive actuator. To demonstrate the metal additive manufacturing using this system, a study is conducted to find the optimal gap between each droplet. Using the MMDoD system, molten metal droplets of uniform shape (571 mu m) are ejected at fixed generation rate and deposited with an optimal gap to print conductive traces on a polymer substrate. As these conductive lines were printed using metal on polymer substrate, they could provide a new way to connect the electronic components to achieve AM of the electronic circuits.

In order to lead this advanced manufacturing technique toward cleaner production and to save costs, this study addresses the ability to remanufacture a wide range of commercially available filaments. Most of them either tend to degrade by chain scission or crosslinking. Only polypropylene (PP)-based filaments appear to be particularly thermally stable and therefore suitable for multiple remanufacturing sequences. As the extrusion step exerts the largest influence on the material in terms of temperature and shear load, this study focused on the morphological, rheological, thermal, processing, tensile, and impact properties of a promising PP composite in the course of multiple consecutive extrusions as well as the impact of additional heat stabilizers. Even after 15 consecutive filament extrusions, the stabilized additively manufactured PP composite revealed an unaltered morphology and therefore the same tensile and impact strength as the initial material. As the viscosity of the material of the 15th extrusion was nearly identical to that of the 1st extrusion sequence, the processability both in terms of extrusion and FFF was outstanding, despite the tremendous amount of shear and thermal stress that was undergone. The present work provides key insights into one possible step toward more sustainable production through FFF.

Here, this fabrication technique is exploited for engineering scaffolds accurately mimicking the shape and size of three types of human cells. The human cell models employed in the study were chosen to include a range of dimensions and different identifiable features to highlight the versatility of this fabrication approach, yet other cell shapes can easily be fabricated in similar manner. The design and fabrication parameters for the additive manufacturing process were optimized to obtain polymeric scaffolds with biomimetic shapes. After fabrication, the cell scaffolds were converted to polymer-cushioned model cell membranes through layer-by layer functionalization with a cationic polymer and a lipid bilayer. Scaffold functionalization was verified using con focal laser scanning microscopy. Polymer-cushioned model cell membranes supported on 3D scaffolds mimicking the shape of human cells are particularly suitable for membrane interaction studies where membrane curvature plays an important role. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the engineering of biomimetic cell membranes by high resolution additive manufacturing combined with surface functionalization. The interdisciplinary approach highlights the value of additive manufacturing as technological solution for challenges encountered in biomedical studies. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Such structures are attractive for use in various engineering applications. It follows that knowledge about the mechanical response of additive manufactured materials, and how to model it numerically, is required. In this work, a polymer manufactured with the stereolithography (SLA) method was studied through tensile and compression testing of smooth and notched specimens. The material exhibited an initial linear elastic behaviour followed by strain-rate-and pressure-dependent inelastic flow before failing at rather large strains in a brittle fracture mode. Motivated by the observed material behaviour, a hyper-viscoelastic constitutive model with a brittle fracture criterion was developed, implemented in a commercial finite element software, and calibrated to the material tests. Compression tests of lattice structures were performed and simulated to validate the model's capabilities at complex stress states. The model captured the experimentally observed nonlinear stress-strain behaviour, and predicted the fracture initiation and a failure mode similar to the experimental results.

Endeavors have been done in 2D flow models, where significant knowledge is achieved in explaining the material anisotropy of the deposited composite parts. Nevertheless, 2D flow models are limited by a couple of assumptions that lose significant characters of the deposition flow. This study is one of the first few that employ a 3D flow model which focuses on the quasi-steady state of the polymer composite melt flow within the nozzle and the subsequent 90-degree turning deposition onto the material substrate. The material flow is assumed as a highly viscous Newtonian flow. The fiber orientation is evaluated using the advanced pARD-RSC fiber orientation tensor evaluation model, via the one-way weakly-coupled flow/orientation analysis formulation. Computed results show the fiber orientation state on the entire cross-section of a deposited bead, which yields a clear view of how the material anisotropy is affected by the locally varied fiber orientation. The 3D-flow prediction proves that the transverse directional fiber alignments are in high degree of similarity as compared to the over-predicted results from the simplified 2D planar flows. In addition, the 3D-model results exhibit a more favorable agreement with the reported experimental data than that yielded by the conventional 2D models.

Additive Manufacturing to Produce Complex 3D Ceramic Parts	JOURNAL OF CERAMIC SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Review						Shaping; additive manufacturing; photopolymerization; stereolithography	STEREOLITHOGRAPHY; FABRICATION; PHOTOPOLYMERIZATION; SUSPENSIONS; COMPONENTS; SCAFFOLDS	Attempts to improve the performance of ceramic parts have recently led to advances in their design and in the processes used to tailor these parts. Thus, Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies, initially developed in the polymers and metals industries, have become of increasing interest for shaping ceramic parts. Among AM techniques, photopolymerization (referred to as stereolithography (SLA) and micro-stereolithography) makes it possible to reach high accuracy that matches the design requirements for new applications of ceramics in a wide range of fields. The development by means of (micro)-stereolithography of complex 3D ceramic parts with improved performance requires the mastering of various parameters linked to the inorganic-organic system involved in this processing route. This paper reports on some recent achievements in the production of ceramics using photopolymerization. Some examples of the work performed at the SPCTS laboratory to produce complex 3D ceramic parts for applications in the fields of information and communication technologies, healthcare and jewellery are presented.

Characterization of polyaryletherketone (PAEK) filaments and printed parts produced by extrusion-based additive manufacturing	POLYMER INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						aromatic polyketone polymers (PAEK); polyaryletherketone (PAEK); polyetheretherketone(PEEK); polyetherketoneketone (PEKK); additive manufacturing (AM); 3D printing (3DP)	STRUCTURE-PROPERTY RELATIONSHIPS; ETHER ETHER KETONE); MOLECULAR-WEIGHT; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; THERMAL HISTORY; CRYSTALLIZATION; PEEK; POLY(ARYL-ETHER-ETHER-KETONE); MORPHOLOGY; POLYETHERETHERKETONE	This study describes a detailed analytical characterization of polyaryletherketone (PAEK) polymers used in extrusion-based additive manufacturing. The results provide key observations and highlight differences between commercially available polymers of the PAEK family, specifically polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and polyetherketoneketone (PEKK). Results suggest that inherent differences in their molecular structure lead to notable differences in terms of their viscoelastic, thermal and physical properties. Similarly, direct comparison of the properties between parent filaments and three-dimensional printed (3DP) parts suggests that, as observed in subtractive processes, the molecular structure of the PAEK polymer selected (PEEK or PEKK), as well as the inherent physical properties associated with it, determine greatly the performance of final 3DP parts. Differential scanning calorimetry results suggest that the glass transition temperature (T-g) of PEEK 3DP bars (146.8 degrees C) is about 8 degrees C lower than that of the parent PEEK filament (154.8 degrees C). These small differences manifest greatly in the viscoelastic response after T-g, and the temperature at which a decrease in storage modulus is observed occurs consistently at lower temperatures in 3DP PEEK bars (ca 130 degrees C) compared to PEEK filaments (ca 150 degrees C). In contrast, no observable differences are noted between parent filaments and 3DP bars in PEKK polymers. For these polymers, the inherent semi-crystalline behavior dominates their thermal and viscoelastic response. These structure-property relationships provide fundamental understanding to aid in the design and manufacturing of several industrial and biomedical applications that could potentially leverage the advantages of high-temperature thermoplastic PAEK resins, as well as in the incorporation of these polymers in a growing number of technologies encompassing the field of additive manufacturing.

The big area additive manufacturing (BAAM) system, developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Manufacturing Demonstration Facility, has been used to manufacture several composite components, demonstration vehicles, molds, and dies. These components have been designed and fabricated using various CF-reinforced thermoplastics. In this study, the dynamic rheological and mechanical properties of a material commonly used in additive manufacturing, 20 wt% CF-acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), as well as three CF-reinforced high-temperature polymers, 25 wt% CF-polyphenylsulfone (PPSU), 35 wt% CF-polyethersulfone (PES), and 40 wt% CF-polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), used to print molds were investigated. The viscoelastic properties, namely storage modulus, loss modulus, tan delta, and complex viscosity, of these composites were studied, and the rheological behavior was related to the BAAM extrusion and bead formation process. The results showed 20 wt% CF-ABS and 40 wt% CF-PPS to display a more dominant elastic component at all frequencies tested while 25 wt% CF-PPSU and 35 wt% CF-PES have a more dominant viscous component. This viscoelastic behavior is then used to inform the deposition and bead formation process during extrusion on the BAAM system.

Smart Manufacturing Process of Carbon-Based Low-Dimensional Structures and Fiber-Reinforced Polymer Composites for Engineering Applications	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE			English	Article						additive manufacturing; carbon; composites; polymers	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; GRAPHENE OXIDE; MATRIX COMPOSITES; TENSILE-STRENGTH; NANOTUBES; SCAFFOLDS; STEREOLITHOGRAPHY; NANOCOMPOSITE; FABRICATION; PERFORMANCE	Reinforced polymers have gained a significant interest in the research community in recent years due to their enhanced performance as compared to their parent polymers. Nanosized reinforcement-based polymer composites have shown a considerable enhancement in performance as compared to micro-/macro-sized fillers. But achieving a high degree of filler alignment in nanocomposites via conventional manufacturing techniques continues to be a challenging task. Additive manufacturing (AM) is a possible solution to this challenge and has undergone a significant development in recent years. AM is an efficient technique to fabricate nanocomposites in complex shapes which uses a layer-by-layer method to fabricate materials and thereby eliminates the need for multi-step processing and the use of fasteners/joints to fabricate complex structures. Due to a wide range of properties and the existence of carbon in a variety of forms, carbon filler-based polymer matrix composites are suitable for applications in several technical sectors. AM of carbon-based structures and fiber-reinforced polymer composites enables the production of highly customized parts with a high degree of filler alignment. AM techniques which are generally employed for the fabrication of carbon-based fillers/fiber-reinforced polymer composites are fused deposition modeling, stereolithography, direct ink writing and selective laser sintering. Although AM techniques are efficient, some critical issues such as voids and defects between interlayers, the low adhesion strength between filaments, part curling and insufficient curing of layers need to be addressed to utilize its full potential.

The layers of material are deposited using a variety of established methodologies, the most popular of which involve either the use of a powerful laser to sinter/melt successive layers of metal/alloy/polymer powders or, the deposition of layers of polymers through a heated extrusion head at a controlled rate. The thermal nature of these processes causes the development of temperature gradients throughout the part and as a result, the part undergoes irregular deformations which ultimately leads to dimensional inaccuracies in the manufactured part. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based methodology is presented in this paper to directly compensate the part geometric design which will help to counter the thermal deformations in the manufactured part. A feed forward ANN model is trained using backpropagation algorithm to study part deformations resulting from the AM process. The trained network is subsequently employed on the part Stereolithography (STL) file to effect the required geometrical corrections. Two examples are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed compensation methodology. A novel approach to evaluate the conformity of the final part profile to the original part CAD profile has also been developed to quantify the performance of the proposed methodology. The results of the examples show substantial improvement in the part accuracy and thus validate the ANN based geometric compensation approach.

If materials used for 3D printers were first mainly polymers, nowadays they are beginning to become more complex in order to allow metal and ceramic 3D printing using composite feedstock. In this work, we aim at additively manufacturing magnetic component. The building process is presented by using filament feedstock for Fused Deposition Modeling process and part of the produced cores have been magnetically characterized. A second innovative printing process using a pellet-based material is investigated for the printing part. In order to consider soft magnetic ferrite, the modeling of the printed object has been carried out. First to calculate the losses in a toroidal inductor and take into account the strong impact of the temperature on the magnetic permeability. Second, to investigate the evolution of magnetic permeability in link with the material density. Thereafter an undulated geometry of a toroidal inductor that is enabled by 3d printing is presented as an illustration. Experimental characterization of the magnetic properties has been carried out to verify the modeling results concerning the impact of the density over permeability.

Integrated manufacture of polymer and conductive tracks for real-world applications	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Conductive tracks; Hybrid 3D printer; Integrated manufacture	FREEFORM FABRICATION; 3D	The present study demonstrates for the first time a unique UK-designed and built Additive Manufacturing (AM) hybrid system that combines polymer based structural deposition with digital deposition of electrically conductive elements. This innovative manufacturing system is based on a mull-planar build approach to improve on many of the limitations associated with AM, such as poor surface finish, low geometric tolerance and poor robustness. Specifically, the approach involves a mull-planar Material Extrusion (ME) process in which separated build stations with up to 5 axes of motion replace traditional horizontally-sliced layer modelling. The construction of multi-material architectures also involved using multiple print systems in order to combine both ME and digital deposition of conductive material. To demonstrate multi-material 3D Printing (3DP) we used three thermoplastics to print specimens, on top of which a unique Ag nano-particulate ink was printed using a non-contact jetting process, during which drop characteristics such as shape, velocity, and volume were assessed using a bespoke drop watching system. Electrical analysis of printed conducive tracks on polymer surfaces was performed during mechanical testing (static tensile and flexural testing and dynamic fatigue testing) to assess robustness of the printed circuits. Both serpentine and straight line patterns were used in the testing of Ag particle loaded ink and they showed very similar resistance changes during mechanical exposure. Monitored resistance and stress changed as a function of strain exhibiting hysteresis with more prominent residual strain during stretching and compression cycles and 3-point bending flexural tests of PA and CoPA substrates. Bare and encapsulated tracks exhibited low electrical resistivity (1-3*10(-6) Omega*m), and its change was more rapid on ABS and minor on PA and CoPA when increasing tensile and flexural strain up to 1.2% and 0.8%, respectively. Resistance of Ag tracks on ABS also increased rapidly during fatigue testing and the tracks easily fractured during repeated stretching-compression cycles at 1% and 1.2% strain. No resistance changes of Ag tracks printed on PA and CoPA were observed at lower strain amplitudes whereas at higher strain amplitudes these changes were the lowest for conducive tracks on CoPA. Thermal analyses were conducted to determine the printed material's glass transition temperature (Tg), stability and degradation behavior to find the optimum annealing conditions post printing. The novel AM printer has the ability to fabricate fully functional objects in one build, including integrated printed circuitry and embedded electronics. It enables product designers and manufactures to produce functional saleable electronic products. This new technology also gives the opportunity for designers to improve existing products, as well as create new products with the added advantages of geometrically unconstrained 3DP.

In addition, additive manufacturing can allow DEAs with complex geometric configurations to be realized. This study investigates analytical approaches to optimize the performance of helical dielectric elastomer actuator (HDEA) based on additive manufacturing technologies. Optimized geometric configurations tailored to additive manufacturing and proper material selection for elastomer and electrode can improve the overall performance of HDEA. Due to the absence of pre-stretch in the elastomer membranes with additive manufacturing, associated drawbacks, such as electromechanical instability, high external voltage requirement, and their alternate solutions are analyzed and discussed. The performance of HDEA are evaluated by displacement, block force, and weight-to-force ratio by varying multiple geometric parameters including membrane thickness, pitch angle, inner-to-outer electrode ratio, and actuation voltage. Since the selection of materials is as important as the geometric parameters of the actuator, printable elastomer and electrode materials with dielectric and mechanical properties for HDEA are evaluated. By optimizing geometric parameters and selecting appropriate materials based on its properties, appropriate manufacturing techniques are discussed to print both dielectric elastomer and electrode layers.

Additive manufacturing (AM) is making an object layer by layer directly from digital data. Previous works of literature have classified additive manufacturing processes into seven types. However, there is a lack of comprehensive review describing the optimization challenges and opportunities in the material extrusion process (polymer technology) and also the need for FDM polymer materials application in impeller making. In this review paper, a specific optimization method called multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) from the mathematical programming technique used in additive manufacturing polymer technology (AMPT) is discussed. The other topics such as different types of optimization techniques, applications of different MCDM tools and their applications in different fields including AM, and the optimization challenges and opportunities in AMPT particularly impeller application are discussed.

As demand for AM parts start to shift from prototypes to end products, there is an increasing impetus to improve the performance of 3D printed polymers. In response, recent studies have begun to explore ways to reinforce polymer matrices through the incorporation and alignment of fillers during the additive manufacturing process. Here, a review of the recent advances in 3D printing techniques for polymer composites has been conducted and analyzed, specifically for their ability to control the alignment and arrangement of discontinuous fillers, as well as other benefits and disadvantages associated with their operations.

This extension creates a bridge to aid the implementation of taking a sustainability approach to additive manufacturing. In order to develop this extension, we distinguish between direct/indirect customers and internal/external customers and then create a matrix of incentives and cognitive frames that we believe will help companies interested in large-scale AM improve both the speed and the effectiveness of AM adoption. We provide an organizing framework that managers can use to create a supply chain that is aligned around closed-loop principles that will help speed adoption and move closer to sustainable goals that exist for AM technologies. These include reduced raw material use, reduced scrap and material overage, reduced rework, and lower transportation costs. The goal is to attain often-conflicting goals of lower long-term costs and decreased environmental footprint. Using our extension, we believe we can provide a useful framework to help managers implementing advanced manufacturing technologies to achieve lower costs and greater environmental sustainability by creating a common supply chain framework around customized, on-demand products.

J	Lovo, JFP; de Camargo, IL; Araujo, LAO; Fortulan, CA				Parreira Lovo, Joao Fiore; de Camargo, Italo Leite; Oliveira Araujo, Luis Antonio; Fortulan, Carlos Alberto			Mechanical structural design based on additive manufacturing and internal reinforcement	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						Mechanical design; material extrusion; mechanical structures; composite; additive manufacturing	3D; PARTS	The design of modern mechanical components often requires the use of low-density and high-strength parts. Additive manufacturing presents competence in obtaining format complexity internally (voids, ducts, channels) and externally (shape, holes). However, parts obtained by material extrusion additive manufacturing are highly anisotropic and relatively weak. This paper aims to present a new mechanical design technique that combines the high geometry flexibility of additive manufacturing with internal structuring reinforcement by high-strength materials, which enables optimized parts with reinforcement in the most mechanical stressed areas during service, through adopting structured internal geometry filled with reinforcement material. Dense test specimens and test specimens with internal structural canals filled with reinforcement material (epoxy resin and carbon fibers) were designed, fabricated and tested physically and virtually. The obtained results provide property values for 3D-printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (typical material of additive manufacturing) and for this polymer reinforced with various reinforcement material configurations (useful for mechanical design). The reinforcement decreased anisotropy and improved mechanical properties. Optimized parts filled with resin and long carbon fibers had maximum flexural resistance of 112 MPa, with a specific weight of 1.1 g/cm(3). This reinforcement provided parts with specific flexural strength similar to structural aluminum alloys, preserving the geometry and external dimension of the printed parts. The technique presented here shows the possibility of new conceptions in mechanical components design and strength optimization by internal reinforcement canals in parts. The technique is useful for mechanical design activity and allows for new product conceptions based on additive manufacturing.

The methacrylate component of the mixture was photocured using UV light exposure and, in a second curing process, the mixture was thermally postcured. The polymers formed a partially miscible system with two glass transition temperature (T-g) peaks measured using dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). The composition and relative rate of reaction of the two orthogonal polymerisations influenced the extent of miscibility of the two polymer-rich phases and the samples were transparent, indicating that the two phases were finely dispersed. The addition of a glycidyl methacrylate compatibiliser further increased the miscibility of the two polymers. The utility of this polymer system for additive manufacturing was investigated and simulated through layer-by-layer processing of the mixture in two steps. Firstly, the methacrylate component was photocured to solidify the material into its final shape, whilst the second step of thermal curing was used to polymerise the epoxy component. With the use of a simulated photomask, a simple shape was formed using the two orthogonal polymerisation stages to produce a solid object. The mechanical properties of this two-phase system were superior to a control sample made only of the methacrylate component, indicating that some reinforcing due to polymerisation of the epoxy across the interfaces had occurred in the postcuring stage.

This work presents a methodology to predict the tensile, compressive, and flexural yield strength of single beads of a large-scale, 3D printed, short-fiber reinforced material. The methodology is built on the strength theory of Van Hattum and Bernardo, which combines the Tsai-Wu failure criteria with Advani and Tucker's orientation averaging technique, allowing fiber orientation flow model results to serve as direct input into strength predictions. Visual advantages of the methodology such as the ability to plot spatially varying strength constants and failure plots are demonstrated. In addition, an analysis of the methodology's sensitivity to various parameters is conducted.

It has greatly added to the medical industry advancements in visualising and creating complex human or animal anatomies and can be used as an aid for surgical planning and preparation, physician and patient pre-operative/treatment education, medical procedure training and upskilling, medical devices, medical device development, and custom medical device manufacturing. Additive manufacturing (AM) is rapidly growing with advances in new material development, higher resolution, and faster speeds, making it a cost-effective alternative manufacturing solution for many medical applications. The objective of this chapter is to provide some guidelines and considerations of the many steps involved in the manufacturing of biomedical polymers and the main post-processing considerations for individual types of industrial polymer technologies.

Recently, there has been increasing interest on sustainability of AM approaches and the materials that can be used. Advances in both AM technologies and polymer chemistry present multiple pathways for AM to become more sustainable, such as raw material sourcing, green synthesis, and end-of-life processing. This review provides a brief overview of AM techniques for polymers, sustainable sourcing of polymers in AM, and the advances of degradable/recyclable polymers in AM. It also provides a perspective of the potential role of AM in economic and chemical circularity, as well as opportunities for digital manufacturing for the future. Biodegradable materials for medical or other biological applications are beyond the scope of this review.

In-situ monitoring of polymer flow temperature and pressure in extrusion based additive manufacturing	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; In-situ; Temperature; Pressure; Extrusion	FUSED DEPOSITION; DYNAMICS	We demonstrate a novel Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) nozzle design to enable measurements of in-situ conditions inside FFF nozzles, which is critical to ensuring that the polymer extrudate is flowing at appropriate temperature and flow rate during the part build process. Testing was performed with ABS filament using a modified Monoprice Maker Select 3D printer. In-situ measurements using the printer's default temperature control settings showed an 11 degrees C decrease in temperature and significant fluctuation in pressure during printing as well as fluctuations while idle of +/- 2 degrees C and +/- 14 kPa. These deviations were eliminated at lower flow rates with a properly calibrated proportional-integral-derivative (PID) system. At the highest tested flow rates, decreases in melt temperature as high as 6.5 degrees C were observed, even with a properly calibrated PID, providing critical insight into the significance of flow rate and PID calibration on actual polymer melt temperature inside the FFF nozzle. Pressure readings ranging from 140 to 6900 kPa were measured over a range of filament feed rates and corresponding extrusion flow rates. In-situ pressure measurements were higher than theoretical predictions using a power-law fluid model, suggesting that the assumptions used for theoretical calculations may not be completely capturing the dynamics in the FFF liquefier. Our nozzle prototype succeeded in measuring the internal conditions of FFF nozzles, thereby providing a number of important insights into the printing process which are vital for monitoring and improving FFF printed parts.

CFF utilizes a similar method of layer by layer printing as fused filament fabrication but is also capable of reinforcing parts with layers of various continuous fibers into a polymer matrix. Due to the orthotropic characteristics of additive manufacturing based on fused filament fabrication, 3D printed parts may present different mechanical behavior under different orientations of stress. Furthermore, technologies such as CFF allow a range of configurations to fabricate and reinforce the parts. In this study, mechanical characterization of polyamide 6 (PA6) reinforced with carbon fiber was conducted by design of experiment as a statistical method, to investigate the effect of reinforcement pattern, reinforcement distribution, print orientation and percentage of fiber on compressive and flexural mechanical properties. CFF technology 3D print stronger parts than conventional additive manufacturing technologies. Maximized compressive response was achieved with a 0.2444 Carbon Fiber volume ratio, concentric and equidistant reinforcement configuration, resulting in a compressive modulus of 2.102 GPa and a stress at proportional limit of 53.3 MPa. Maximized flexural response was achieved with 0.4893 Carbon Fiber volume ratio, concentric reinforcement and perpendicular to the applied force, resulting in a flexural modulus of 14.17 GPa and a proportional limit of 231.1 MPa.

New types of 3D printers have appeared and new types of polymeric and composite materials have been developed for these printers. Thus it passed very quickly from the stage in which the parts that were made by rapid prototyping (RP) only to be exposed (demonstration parts) to stage AM the parts are fully functional. Of course, the future of AM is still on the horizon, it is barely visible. The other technologies for forming the geometry of the part, ie subtractive manufacturing technology and formative manufacturing technology are still the basis of industrial production. Each technology has its own advantages and disadvantages and is chosen on a case-by-case basis, depending on the objectives pursued. In this paper, a study is made on the rapid prototyping of a single pump rotor part. The material of the piece is of polymer type, ABS. The piece was made in two variants: by additive manufacturing technology (PolyJet) and by subtractive manufacturing technology (milling). After processing, several parameters were followed, such as the functionality of the part, the surface quality, the mechanical tensile strength, the dimensional accuracy, and last but not least the manufacturing cost and the duration of the manufacturing cycle. The data thus obtained were processed with an artificial intelligence program for decision making.	[Belgiu, George; Turc, Cristian G.

Although their final products differ significantly in terms of mechanical properties and building cost, many structural optimization studies were performed with either one without systematic justification. Therefore, this study investigated whether the Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) and Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) methodologies can provide similar conclusions when performing geometrical manipulations for optimizing structural crashworthiness. Two identical sets of four shapes of stiffened hexagonal cells were built and crushed under quasi-static loading. The results were compared in terms of collapsing behavior, load-carrying performance, and energy-absorption capability. Although the observed failure modes were different since the base-materials differ, similar improvement trends in performance were observed between both fabrication approaches. Therefore, FDM was recommended as a fabrication method to optimize thin-walled cellular hexagonal parameters since it was 80% more time-efficient and 53.6% cheaper than the DMLS technique.

DSSC are mostly flexible, easier to handle and are less susceptible to damage compared to c-Si solar cells. Additionally, DSSC is an excellent choice for indoor application as they perform better under diverse light condition. Most DSSCs are made of liquid medium sandwiched between two conductive polymer layers. However, DSSCs have significantly lower efficiencies compared to silicon solar cells. Also, use of liquid medium resulting in leaking of liquid, and occasional freezing during cold weather, and thermal expansion during hot weather conditions. DSSC can be manufactured in small quantities using relatively inexpensive solution-phase techniques such as roll-to-roll processing and screen printing technology. However, scaling-up the DSSC manufacturing from small-scale laboratory tests to sizeable industrial production requires better and efficient manufacturing processes. This research studies the feasibility of using additive manufacturing technique to fabricate electrodes of DSSC. The study aims to overcome the limitations of DSSCs including preventing leakage and providing more customized design. Experimental studies are performed to evaluate the effects of critical process parameters affecting the quality of electrodes for DSSC. Volume resistivity test is performed to evaluate the efficiency of the electrodes. In this study, the electrodes of DSSC are successfully fabricated using Fused Disposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing technique. The results of this study would enable additive manufacturing technology towards rapid commercialization of DSSC technology.

This study shows an experimental analysis of the mechanical behavior of three types of core, including (i) out-of-plane and (ii) in-plane hexagonal honeycomb, and (iii) S-shape corrugated core. The fused deposition modeling method (FDM) is applied in the manufacture of fully integrated sandwich structures using polylactic acid (PLA) biopolymer filaments. Tensile, flexural and Charpy impact tests are used for the experimental investigation. The failure modes of polymeric structures are analyzed. The out-of-plane -comb and S-shape corrugated panels achieve similar mechanical behavior, however, superior tensile modulus, tensile strength, flexural modulus, flexural strength and energy absorbed are obtained in comparison with in-plane -comb core panels. Sandwich panels fabricated by AM achieve acceptable mechanical properties for secondary structural applications, especially when lightness is required.

Additive manufacturing technology has been emerging as a solution, enhancing circular economy models, and using recycled composites for glass fiber-reinforced polymers is spreading as a new additive manufacturing trend. Nevertheless, their mechanical properties are still not comparable to pristine materials. The purpose of this paper is to examine the additive re-manufacturing of end-of-life glass fiber composites with mechanical performances that are comparable to virgin glass fiber-reinforced materials. Through a systematic characterization of the recyclate, requirements of the filler for the liquid deposition modeling process were identified. Printability and material surface quality of different formulations were analyzed using a low-cost modified 3D printer. Two hypothetical design concepts were also manufactured to validate the field of application. Furthermore, an understanding of the mechanical behavior was accomplished by means of tensile tests, and the results were compared with a benchmark formulation with virgin glass fibers. Mechanically recycled glass fibers show the capability to substitute pristine fillers, unlocking their use for new fields of application.

This investigation presents a comparative experimental analysis of long-fiber-reinforced thermoplastic parts (LFTs), which are produced through additively manufactured injection molding polymer tools. After giving a review on the state of the art of AT and LFTs, additive manufacturing (AM) plastic tools are compared to conventionally manufactured steel and aluminum tools toward their qualification for spare part and small series production as well as functional validation. The assessment of the polymer tools focuses on three quality criteria concerning the LFT parts: geometrical accuracy, mechanical properties, and fiber configuration. The analysis of the fiber configuration includes fiber length, fiber concentration, and fiber orientation. The results show that polymer tools are fully capable of manufacturing LFTs with a cycle number within hundreds before showing critical signs of deterioration or tool failure. The produced LFTs moldings provide sufficient quality in geometrical accuracy, mechanical properties, and fiber configuration. Further, specific anomalies of the fiber configuration can be detected for all tool types, which include the occurrence of characteristic zones dependent on the nominal fiber content and melt flow distance. Conclusions toward the improvement of additively manufactured polymer tool life cycles are drawn based on the detected deteriorations and failure modes.

Bones' fractures are common, and the healing process is physiologically complex and involves both mechanical and biological aspects. Tissue engineering of bone scaffolds holds great promise for the future treatment of bone injuries. However, conventional technologies to prepare bone scaffolds cannot provide the required properties of human bones. Over the past decade, three-dimensional (3D) printing or additive manufacturing technologies have enabled control over the creation of bone scaffolds with personalized geometries, appropriate materials, and tailored pores. This article aims to review recent advances in the fabrication of bone scaffolds for bone repair and regeneration. A detailed review of bone fracture repair and an in-depth discussion on conventional manufacturing and 3D printing techniques are introduced with an emphasis on novel studies concepts, potentials, and limitations.

The geometric shapes of polymer powder particles and fibres are represented by multi-sphere particles and individual cylinders with round ends, respectively. The numerical model can help to understand the flow dynamics of composite powder particles and the formation mechanisms of voids in powder packing processes. The numerical model has been utilised to analyse the effects of packing parameters on the packing quality of the powder bed. The simulation results suggest that the increase of the powder layer thickness is beneficial for increasing the packing density and lowering the surface roughness of the powder bed. A high roller spreading velocity degrades the packing quality of the powder bed. A small number of fibres in the composite powder particles are in favour of the packing quality, while excessive fibres reduce the packing quality of the powder bed.

Influences of zirconium tungstate additives on characteristics of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) components fabricated via material extrusion additive manufacturing process	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Warping; Coefficient of thermal expansion; Material extrusion additive manufacturing	THERMAL-EXPANSION COEFFICIENT; FUSED DEPOSITION; PHASE-TRANSFORMATION	Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), a thermoplastic material with excellent resilience and piezoelectric potential, is a natural candidate for use in filament-based additive manufacturing technologies. However, due to the high thermal expansion and low surface energy of homopolymer PVDF, fabrication of this polymer via extrusion deposition processes is challenging, often resulting in substantial stress accumulation and unwanted distortion in printed parts. To address these challenges, this work investigates the effects of adding microscale zirconium tungstate particulate to improve the printability of PVDF materials. Zirconium tungstate was specifically selected because for its demonstrated negative coefficient of thermal expansion over the range of standard filament extrusion deposition method processing temperatures. Composite filament specimens were characterized with respect to mechanical, thermal, and microstructural properties. Compared with pure homopolymer printed specimens, results show that the particulate additives effectively lowered the net coefficient of thermal expansion at the expense of yield strength and total elongation to failure, while the semi-crystalline structure showed a mild reduction in beta-phase formation associated with increasing particulate content.

A myriad of techniques utilizing the directed energy of lasers were invented. Lasers are used to selectively sinter or fuse incremental layers in powder-beds, melt streaming powder following a programmed path, and polymerize photopolymers in a liquid vat layer-by-layer. The laser is an energy source of choice for repair of damaged components, for manufacture of new or replacement parts, and for rapid prototyping of concept designs. Lasers enable microstructure gradients and heterogeneous structures designed to exhibit unique properties and behavior. Laser-based additive manufacturing has been successful in producing relatively simple near net-shape metallic parts saving material and cost, but requiring finish-machining and in repair and refurbishment of worn components. It has been routinely used to produce polymer parts. These capabilities have been widely recognized as evidenced by the explosion in interest in AM technology, nationally. These successes are, however, tempered by challenges facing practitioners such as process and part qualification and verification, which are needed to bring AM as a true manufacturing technology. The ONR manufacturing science program, in collaboration with other agencies, invested in basic R&D in AM since its beginnings. It continues to invest, currently focusing on developing cyber-enabled manufacturing systems for AM. It is believed that such computation, communication and control approaches will help in validating AM and moving it to the factory floor along side CNC machines.

Powder bed fusion processes use a laser to melt a polymer powder at predefined locations and iterate the scheme to build 3D objects. The design of flowable powders is a critical parameter for a successful fabrication process that currently limits the choice of available materials. Here, a bottom-up process is introduced to fabricate tailored polymer- and composite supraparticles for powder-based additive manufacturing processes by controlled aggregation of colloidal primary particles. These supraparticles exhibit a near-spherical shape and tailored composition, morphology, and surface roughness. These parameters can be precisely controlled by the mixing and size ratio of the primary particles. Polystyrene/silica composite particles are chosen as a model system to establish structure-property relations connecting shape, morphology, and surface roughness to the adhesion within the powder, which is accessed by tensile strength measurements. The adhesive properties are then connected to powder flowability and it is shown that the resulting powders allow the formation of dense powder films with uniform coverage. Finally, successful powder bed fusion is demonstrated by producing macroscopic single layer specimens with uniform distribution of nanoscale silica additives.

J	Allison, J; Sharpe, C; Seepersad, CC				Allison, Jared; Sharpe, Conner; Seepersad, Carolyn Conner			Powder bed fusion metrology for additive manufacturing design guidance	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Design guidelines; Powder bed fusion; Selective laser sintering; Metrology	PARAMETERS; ANISOTROPY	Design for additive manufacturing (DFAM) guidelines are important for helping designers avoid iterations and leverage the design freedoms afforded by additive manufacturing (AM). Comprehensive design guidelines should incorporate a variety of features of interest to designers, and given the wide variety of AM processes and their associated capabilities and limitations, those guidelines may need to be process- or even machine-specific. One way to generate detailed DFAM guidelines is to implement a metrology study focused on a strategically designed test part. This paper describes how quantitative design guidelines are compiled for a polymer selective laser sintering (SLS) process via a metrology study. As part of the metrology study, a test part is designed to focus specifically on geometric resolution and accuracy of the polymer SLS process. The test part is compact, allowing it to be easily inserted into existing SLS builds and therefore eliminating the need for dedicated metrology builds. To build a statistical foundation upon which design guidelines can be compiled, multiple copies of the test part are fabricated within existing commercial builds in a factorial study with materials, build orientations, and locations within the build chamber as control factors. Design guidelines are established by measuring and analyzing the as-built test parts. The guidelines are summarized in this paper and documented in a publicly accessible, online web tool.

This system is used in an integrated way with the filamentary fusion additive manufacturing technology and allows a localized and oriented reinforcement of polymer components for advanced engineering applications at a low cost. To demonstrate the capabilities of the developed system, composite components of thermoplastic matrix (polyamide) reinforced with pre-impregnated long carbon fiber (carbon + polyamide), 1 K and 3 K, were processed and their tensile and flexural strength evaluated. It was demonstrated that the tensile strength value depends on the density of carbon fibers present in the composite, and that with the passage of 2 to 4 layers of fibers, an increase in breaking strength was obtained of about 366% and 325% for the 3 K and 1 K yarns, respectively. The increase of the fiber yarn diameter leads to higher values of tensile strength of the composite. The obtained standard deviation reveals that the deposition process gives rise to components with anisotropic mechanical properties and the need to optimize the processing parameters, especially those that lead to an increase in adhesion between deposited layers.

The motivation for using these sustainable alternatives in 3D printing includes enhancing material properties of the resulting printed parts, while providing a green alternative to carbon or glass filled polymer matrices, all at reduced material costs. Previous review articles on this topic have focused only on introducing the use of natural fillers with material extrusion AM and discussion of their subsequent material properties. This review not only discusses the present state of materials extrusion AM using natural filler-based composites but will also fill in the knowledge gap regarding state-of-the-art applications of these materials. Emphasis will also be placed on addressing the challenges associated with 3D printing using these materials, including use with large-scale manufacturing, while providing insight to overcome these issues in the future.

Herein, we demonstrate the additive manufacturing of catalytically active living materials (AMCALM) for continuous fermentation. A multi-stimuli-responsive yeast-laden hydrogel ink, based on F127-dimethacrylate, was developed and printed using a direct-write 3D printer. The reversible stimuli-responsive behaviors of the polymer hydrogel inks to temperature and pressure are critical, as they enabled the facile incorporation of yeast cells and subsequent fabrication of 3D lattice constructs. Subsequent photo-cross-linking of the printed polymer hydrogel afforded a robust elastic material. These yeast-laden living materials were metabolically active in the fermentation of glucose into ethanol for 2 weeks in a continuous batch process without significant reduction in efficiency (similar to 90% yield of ethanol). This cell immobilization platform may potentially be applicable toward other genetically modified yeast strains to produce other high-value chemicals in a continuous biofermentation process.

Photoresponsive units are attractive for this purpose, as the spatial and temporal application of light is easily controlled. Coumarin derivatives undergo a [2 + 2] cycloaddition upon exposure to long-wave UV irradiation (365 nm), and this process can be reversed using short-wave UV light (254 nm). Therefore, polymers cross-linked by coumarin groups are excellent candidates as reversible covalent gels. In this work, copolymerization of coumarin-containing monomers with the hydrophilic comonomer N,N-dimethylacrylamide yielded water-soluble, linear polymers that could be cured with long-wave UV light into free-standing hydrogels, even in the absence of a photoinitiator. Importantly, the gels were reverted back to soluble copolymers upon short-wave UV irradiation. This process could be cycled, allowing for recycling and remolding of the hydrogel into additional shapes. Further, this hydrogel can be imprinted with patterns through a mask-based, post-gelation photoetching method. Traditional limitations of this technique, such as the requirement for uniform etching in one direction, have been overcome by combining these materials with a soft-matter additive manufacturing methodology. In a representative application of this approach, we printed solid structures in which the interior coumarin-cross-linked gel is surrounded by a nondegradable gel. Upon exposure to short-wave UV irradiation, the coumarin-cross-linked gel was reverted to soluble prepolymers that were washed away to yield hollow hydrogel objects.

By using recycled filaments, waste and future costs can be efficiently cut while creating in-house, customizable, filaments. Testing mixed filaments is necessary to determine the physical and chemical benefits and costs of mixing filaments. This work aims to characterize mixtures of Polylactic Acid and Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene. Mixtures were characterized through tensile strength testing and differential scanning calorimetry of extruded filament samples. The tested mixed filaments were found to be comparable to purchased filaments, with drastic increases in elasticity and decreases in torsional strength and tensile strength. This study shows that while possible to produce mixed filaments, and in spite of their chemical similarities, mixtures are not comparable in physical strength to pure filaments.

J	Peters, D; Drallmeier, J; Bristow, DA; Landers, RG; Kinzel, E				Peters, Daniel; Drallmeier, Joseph; Bristow, Douglas A.; Landers, Robert G.; Kinzel, Edward			Sensing and control in glass additive manufacturing	MECHATRONICS			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Path planning; Process control		There has been tremendous interest in the Additive Manufacturing (AM) of polymers, metals, and ceramics leading to a wealth of research and development of these processes. By contrast, there has been little attention paid to AM processes for glass. This paper presents a custom-made glass additive machine. A CO2 laser is used to generate a molten pool of glass into which glass filaments are fed. A motion system is used to trace a layer, after which the build platform is lowered to fabricate the next layer. Two of the unique issues that must be addressed in the AM of glass are 1) various mechanisms can cause the formation of bubbles that deteriorate part optical and mechanical properties and 2) significant processing forces can move the melt pool away from its desired location. In this paper a melt pool temperature controller is designed to regulate the melt pool temperature at a constant value and a path and trajectory generation algorithm is constructed to maintain a constant glass filament feed direction relative to the scan velocity. The experimental results demonstrate that the melt pool temperature controller is able to avoid bubble formation over a wide range of build speeds and that the path planned directional-control is able to maintain good dimensional accuracy throughout closed contours. The capabilities of the AM for glass machine are demonstrated on a thin-walled, multi-layer star pattern and a spring in which the material is printed in freespace without the need for support structures.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the adoption process of AM within a manufacturing system and its business impact. Design/methodology/approach - Research was conducted to collect empirical data at two manufacturing case companies in the North West England. Both cases are located in areas of industrial recovery using AM engineering innovation for value creation. Findings - Early findings showed that the implementation of AM caused a shift in value propositions and the creation of additional value streams (VSs) for the case study companies. AM was shown to compliment and strengthen traditional manufacturing VSs rather than replacing them. Research limitations/implications - Limitations include the generalizability due to the number and location of case companies included in this research. Practical implications - It is worthwhile to explore the opportunities that AM brings with the existing customer base as it has the potential to add unexplored and untapped value. However, managers need to be mindful of the capability and resources required to put the VS into practice. Social implications - Both cases resulted in skill retainment and development due to the implementation of AM. Hence, the innovation contributed to regional economic recovery and business survival. Originality/value - This empirical research is one of the early field explorations focussing on the impact of AM on VS structures. Hence, this paper contributes to the area of technology enhanced manufacturing systems.

We conduct non-planar slicing and optimize the print trajectories to maximize the alignment between the material deposition direction and the stress flow induced by a predefined load case. The trajectory optimization framework considers manufacturability constraints in the form of uniform layer height and line spacing. We demonstrate the method by manufacturing a load bearing mechanical bracket using a 5-axis 3D printer and a liquid crystal polymer material. The failure strength and stiffness of the optimized bracket are improved by a factor of 44 and 6 respectively when compared with conventional printing.

The maturation of AM has made it a viable alternative to Subtractive Manufacturing (SM) processes, nevertheless there remain several unexplored opportunities. One of these is profile plastic ex-trusion tooling, which is typically produced at low volumes, can be complex in geometry, and could benefit from AM's bottom-up process. Such manufacturing options raise the question of how one can evaluate whether AM should be considered as opposed to SM. The objective of this work is to establish a technology assessment method to evaluate which extrusion profile cases warrant consideration for AM. Results from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of polymer flow through the flow channel are related to several applied parameters used by the extrusion industry. This provides a means to evaluate a tool's design virtually before implementing in production. The technology assessment is performed on a U-Channel case, which is a common open profile shape with several product variations in industry. Results from this work indicate that there is no advantage of pursuing AM over an SM informed design for the specific U-Channel case used in this study. In addition, streamlining features alone do not necessarily lead to clear improve-ments, highlighting the need for technology assessment tools and methods to evaluate whether AM or SM should be implemented. This work lays the foundation for evaluating which extrusion profile cases warrant consideration for an AM process.(c) 2023 CIRP.

Additive manufacturing of reflective and transmissive optics - potential and new solutions for optical systems	LASER 3D MANUFACTURING V	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	5th Meeting of Laser 3D Manufacturing at Photonics West Conference	JAN 29-FEB 01, 2018	San Francisco, CA	SPIE, PolarOnyx, Inc		3D printing; Additive Manufacturing; reflective and transmissive monolithic optical component; active optical components		Additive manufacturing enables the realization of complex shaped parts. This also provides a high potential for optical components. Thus elements with virtually any geometry can be realized, which is often difficult with conventional fabrication methods. Depending on the material and thus the manufacturing method used, either transparent optics or reflective optics can be developed with the aid of additive manufacturing. Ultimately, the application or the specification decides on the approach. For example, transmissive 3D printed parts exhibit the disadvantage of a significant reduced transmission. Conversely, reflective 3d printed optics often requires a greater amount of rework in order to achieve a sufficient optical quality of the surface. Here, we discuss 3D printed metal optics (manufactured using a selective laser melting machine) and 3D printed polymer optics (realized either by stereolithography or by multijet modling). In addition to the basic properties, the post-processing of the 3D printed optics is regarded. This includes, for example, cleaning and polishing of the surface using lasers, a robot based fluidjet process for metallic and polymer optics. In the case of the polymer optics a dip-coating process was developed in order to improve the surface quality, which is presented as well. Our aim is to integrate the additive manufactured optics into optical systems. Therefore we present different examples in order to point out new possibilities and new solutions enabled by 3D printing of the parts. In this context, the development of 3D printed reflective and transmissive adaptive optics will be discussed as well.

Research on its application for the development of customized devices tailored to specific anatomical parts of the human body can provide new personalized medicine strategies. This research activity was aimed at testing a new multifunctional AM system for the design and fabrication by MEX of anatomical and dog-bone-shaped PLA samples with different infill densities and deposition angles. In particular, a commercial PLA filament was employed to validate the computer-aided design (CAD) and manufacturing (CAM) process for the development of scaffold prototypes modeled on a human bone defect. Physical-chemical characterization of the obtained samples by H-1-NMR spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) demonstrated a small reduction of polymer molecular weight (-5%) due to thermal processing, as well as that the commercial polymer employed was a semicrystalline poly(D,L-lactide). Mechanical characterization highlighted the possibility of tuning elastic modulus and strength, as well as the elongation at break up to a 60% value by varying infill parameters.

Due to their superior material properties compared to steels, tungsten carbide?cobalt hardmetals are an exciting material for manufacturing tools. AM technologies' geometric freedom makes it possible to design more efficient tools compared to other manufacturing techniques. These technologies are known as resource-efficient and sustainable processes. The material that is not required for manufacturing is re-used for the production of additional components. The high energy input in laser powder bed-based AM processes leads to strong grain growth and brittle phases, so the achievable mechanical properties are significantly limited. Lithography-based additive manufacturing shows high potential due to the manufacturing of a polymer-bound green body and a subsequent heat treatment. Tungsten carbide?cobalt (88-12 wt%) slurries were developed with a solid content of 40 vol%, based on the resin's reactive components. Dispersants made it possible to increase the maximum processable volume fraction of solid particles. A thixotropic agent helped stabilize the slurry. Rheological investigations characterized these effects. The influence of the photoinitiator concentration and the volume fraction of tungsten carbide and cobalt particles on the curing depth was analyzed. Prepared slurries and manufactured multi-layered green bodies were evaluated for homogeneity using quantitative microstructure analysis. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cellulose is abundantly available renewable and sustainable raw material. This work focused on studying the properties of thermoplastic cellulose-based composites and their properties using injection molding and 3D printing of granules. The aim was to maximize the cellulose content in composites. Different compounds were prepared using cellulose acetate propionate (CAP) and commercial cellulose acetate propionate with plasticizer (CP) as polymer matrices, microcellulose (mc) and novel cellulose-ester additives; cellulose octanoate (C8) and cellulose palmitate (C16). The performance of compounds was compared to a commercial poly(lactic acid)-based cellulose fiber containing composite. As a result, CP-based compounds had tensile and Charpy impact strength properties comparable to commercial reference, but lower modulus. CP-compounds showed glass transition temperature (Tg) over 58% and heat distortion temperature (HDT) 12% higher compared to reference. CAP with C16 had HDT 82.1 degrees C. All the compounds were 3D printable using granular printing, but CAP compounds had challenges with printed layer adhesion. This study shows the potential to tailor thermoplastic cellulose-based composite materials, although more research is needed before obtaining all-cellulose 3D printable composite material with high-performance.

However, most currently existing methods of producing coatings do not go beyond the laboratory, as they have low encapsulation efficiency and/or difficulties in scaling up. The PLACE (Printed Layered Adjustable Cargo Encapsulation) technology proposed in this article uses an additive approach for film manufacturing. PLACE technology is accessible, scalable, and reproducible in any laboratory. As a demonstration of the technology capabilities, we fabricated layered drug-eluting polyglycolic acid films containing different concentrations of Cefazolin antibiotic. The influence of the amount of loaded drug component on the film production process and the release kinetics was studied. The specific loading of drugs was significantly increased to 200-400 mu g/cm(2) while maintaining the uniform release of Cefazolin antibiotic in a dosage sufficient for local antimicrobial therapy for 14 days. The fact that the further increase in the drug amount results in the crystallization of a substance, which can lead to specific defects in the cover film formation and accelerated one-week cargo release, was also shown, and options for further technology development were proposed.

These processes are being used more and more to produce models, prototypes and partially finished products made of plastic, metal or ceramic and require neither a tool nor a form. Affected by decreasing installation spaces and increasing functional densities, flexible methods for circuit board application and their combination with additive manufacturing are in the focus of electronic industry research activities. In the context of this article both a thermoplastic polymer polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) which has been prepared to defined powder fractions with cryogenic milling, and the established and commercially available SLS material (PA12, PA2200) were the subject of a dry coating process with LDS-additives. Subsequently, these LDS-powders were processed with SLS to form test specimens. Finally their surface was structured and metallized through the LPKF-LDS-process (Laser-Direct-Structuring). Based on these metallized specimens, the metallization was studied as a function of an LDS-additive filling ratio. To uncover positive synergy effects from additively manufacturing the polymer body, the metallization was analyzed in terms of shape and adhesive strength.

This automated technique focuses on polymer composite manufacturing for use in a wide range of automotive and aerospace applications. The AFP process offers an elevated level of customization through the possibility of placing each individual tow at custom-designed trajectories. Additive manufacturing (AM) method, on the other hand, has the potential to fabricate functional end user parts of complex geometries, thus eliminating the need for costly tooling, multi-step processing and fasteners or joints. This paper will highlight the potential of fusing AFP and AM processes to fabricate complex 3D polymer based composite parts. A combination of these two processes suggests a promising option for composite materials development, improving composite structures in terms of complexity and customizability. The paper presents the adopted research methodology, background research, the design, development and set up of an experimental workcell that fuses AM and AFP, and the design methodology which is required to design complex composite parts using the proposed manufacturing process. Main challenges and opportunities are discussed, such as how restrictions of conventional composite production can be eased, and additional freedoms of design can be achieved.

This is to directly and continuously print piezoelectric devices from Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymeric filament rods under a strong electric field and mechanical stretching along the filament core. Piezoelectric devices were fabricated and its crystalline phase transition was measured by using the Fourier transform infrared spectroscope. The results demonstrate that increasing the electric field increases the piezoelectric crystalline phase transitions and results in a device with higher current output under stress. This technique can be used to fabricate fully 3D freeform structured piezoelectric devices for sensing, actuator and energy harvesting applications with a simple, low cost, integrated processing and fabrication step.

Continuous Additive Manufacturing using Olefin Metathesis	ADVANCED SCIENCE			English	Article						additive manufacturing; dual-wavelength; olefin metathesis; photosensitizer; stereolithography	THIOL-MICHAEL ADDITION; POLYMERS; POLYMERIZATION	The development of chemistry is reported to implement selective dual-wavelength olefin metathesis polymerization for continuous additive manufacturing (AM). A resin formulation based on dicyclopentadiene is produced using a latent olefin metathesis catalyst, various photosensitizers (PSs) and photobase generators (PBGs) to achieve efficient initiation at one wavelength (e.g., blue light) and fast catalyst decomposition and polymerization deactivation at a second (e.g., UV-light). This process enables 2D stereolithographic (SLA) printing, either using photomasks or patterned, collimated light. Importantly, the same process is readily adapted for 3D continuous AM, with printing rates of 36 mm h(-1) for patterned light and up to 180 mm h(-1) using un-patterned, high intensity light.

Large robotic arm- and gantry-systems have been created to print building parts using aggregate-based materials, metals, or polymers. Significant benefits of AM are the automation of the production process, a high degree of design freedom, and the resulting potential for optimization. However, the building components and 3D-printing processes need to be modeled appropriately. In this paper, the current state of AM in construction is reviewed. AM processes and systems as well as their application in research and construction projects are presented. Moreover, digital methods for planning 3D-printed building parts and AM processes are described.

Geometric imperfections of additive manufactured members	ENGINEERING STRUCTURES			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Geometric imperfections; Tolerances of hollow sections; Wire arc welding process; 3D-scanning		Challenges in civil engineering and construction industries increase, and simultaneously it is necessary to provide a sustainable utilization of resources. Optimising material applications and manufacturing processes is therefore essential for modern constructions. Highly optimised structural components are already in use in lightweight constructions as well as in aircraft and vehicle industries. In the course of digitisation, new possibilities have evolved in recent years for producing individual and optimized solutions with regard to the consumption of materials, especially in construction industries. Methods of generative or additive manufacturing are employed to develop various prototypes of structural components. In this context, Wire-Arc-Additive-Manufacturing (WAAM) is a promising method for steel structures. However, it remains to be investigated to what extent dimensional accuracy, surface finish, weld quality and repeated thermal influences from the build-up process affect the structural behaviour of corresponding members. This paper deals with the geometric imperfections of corresponding additively manufactured profiles and exemplifies their influence on the bearing capacity.

It is capable of manufacturing complex-shaped parts from a variety of materials including metals, ceramics, and polymers. This paper provides a comprehensive review on currently available reports on metal binder jetting from both academia and industry. Critical factors and their effects in metal binder jetting are reviewed and divided into two categories, namely material-related factors and process-related parameters. The reported data on density, dimensional and geometric accuracy, and mechanical properties achieved by metal binder jetting are summarized. With parameter optimization and a suitable sintering process, ten materials have been proven to achieve a relative density of higher than 90%. Indepth discussion is provided regarding densification as a function of various attributes of powder packing, printing, and post-processing. A few grades of stainless steel obtained equivalent or superior mechanical properties compared to cold working. Although binder jetting has gained its popularity in the past several years, it has not been sufficiently studied compared with other metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes such as powder bed fusion and directed energy deposition. Some aspects that need further research include the understanding of powder spreading process, binder-powder interaction, and part shrinkage.

For instance, quality of AM-fabricated parts varies from run to run and from machine to machine. There is also a lack of standards developed for AM processes. Another limitation is inconsistent dimensional accuracy error, which is often out of the standard tolerancing range. To tackle these challenges, this work aims at predicting scaling ratio for each part separately depending on its placement, orientation and CAD characteristics. Recent attention to machine learning techniques as a tool for data analysis in additive manufacturing shows that such methods as classical artificial neural networks (ANN), such as multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and convolutional neural networks (CNN) have a great potential. For the data collected on polymer powder bed fusion system (EOS P395), MLP outperformed CNN based on accuracy of prediction and mean squared error.

Because the parts are created in a layer-by-layer manner, the flexibility of additive manufacturing is unparalleled and has opened the design space to enable features like undercuts and internal channels which cannot exist on traditional, subtractively manufactured parts. This flexibility can also be leveraged for optical applications. This paper outlines some of the current uses of 3D printing in the optical manufacturing process at Optimax. Several materials and additive technologies are utilized, including polymer printing through fused deposition modeling, which creates parts by depositing a softened thermoplastic filament in a layerwise fashion. Stereolithography, which uses light to cure layers of a photopolymer resin, will also be discussed. These technologies are used to manufacture functional prototypes, fixtures, sealed housings, and other components. Additionally, metal printing through selective laser melting, which uses a laser to melt metal powder layers into a dense solid, will be discussed due to the potential to manufacture thermally stable optical-mechanical assembly frameworks and functional optics. Examples of several additively manufactured optical components will be shown.

Here, in order to improve the flexibility of polydicyclopentadiene, comonomers (norbornene-terminated polyether, ND-230,400,2000) are designed and synthesized, which can copolymerize with dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) by FP. The polymers (ND) prepared by ND-2000 and DCPD have tunable mechanical properties, from thermosets to elastomers. Specifically, the breaking elongation of the polymers can be varied 69-fold, from 6.1% to 423.4% by controlling the proportion of ND-2000. Among them, ND polymer with 50 wt% ND-2000 has good elastic behavior without yield. And, the reaction mixture solutions of DCPD and ND-2000 have the characteristics of controllable gel time and shear thinning, which make it have the potential of application in additive manufacturing.

MCC is modified by grafting onto its surface with different silanes, in particular perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane, n-octyltriethoxysilane (OTS), or aminopropyltriethoxysilane. The efficacy of the surface modification is confirmed by attenuated total reflectance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The affinity of the modified MCC to the polar PP matrix is investigated by direct melt-compounding, and the applicability of the resulting composites for material ME-AM is accessed by fabrication of filaments and evaluating the relevant property requirements. The surface modification of the MCC improves their dispersibility in PP and enhances the mechanical properties of the composites. Moreover, the OTS-modified MCC shows the best reinforcement, good surface finish of the filament, and flawless printability.

Machine learning is typically limited to the application of online monitoring of AM systems due to a lack of accurate and accessible databases. In this work, a system is developed for real-time identification of defective regions, and closed-loop adjustment of process parameters for robot-based CFRP AM is validated. The main novelty is the development of a deep learning model for defect detection, classification, and evaluation in realtime with high accuracy. The proposed method is able to identify two types of CFRP defects (i.e., misalignment and abrasion). The combined deep learning with geometric analysis of the level of misalignment is applied to quantify the severity of individual defects. A deep learning approach is successfully developed for the online detection of defects, and the defects are effectively controlled by closed-loop adjustment of process parameters, which is never achievable in any conventional methods of composite fabrication.

Technical pathways for distributed recycling of polymer composites for distributed manufacturing: Windshield wiper blades	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Polymer composite; Recycling; Additive manufacturing; Distributed recycling; Distributed manufacturing; 3D printing	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; PROCESS PARAMETERS; EXTRUSION SYSTEM; WASTE POLYMER; REPRAP; FILAMENT; POLYETHYLENE; FABRICATION; RECYCLEBOT; TIME	Centralized waste plastic recycling is economically challenging, yet distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM) provides consumers with direct economic incentives to recycle. This study explores the technical pathways for DRAM of complex polymer composites using a case study of windshield wiper blades. These blades are a thermoplastic composite made up of a soft (flexible) and hard (less flexible) material. The distributed manufacturing methods included mechanical grinding to fused granular fabrication, heated syringe printing, 3-D printed molds coupled to injection molding and filament production in a recyclebot to fused filament fabrication. The particle size, angle of repose, thermal and rheological properties are characterized for the two sub-materials to define the conditions for the extrusion. A successful pathway for fabricating new products was found and the mechanical properties of the resultant components were quantified. Finally, the means to convert scrap windshield wiper blades into useful, high-value, bespoke biomedical products of fingertip grips for hand prosthetics was demonstrated. This study showed that the DRAM model of materials recycling can be used to improve the variety of solutions for a circular economy.

Recycling meal-ready-to-eat (MRE) pouches into polymer filament for material extrusion additive manufacturing	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Distributed recycling; Fused filament fabrication; Low density polyethylene; Military applications	HIGH-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE; LIFE-CYCLE ANALYSIS; MULTIPLE EXTRUSIONS; FUSED DEPOSITION; DEGRADATION; NANOCOMPOSITES; STABILIZATION; POLYPROPYLENE; FEEDSTOCK; WASTE	Millions of Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) are consumed annually by soldiers around the world. This results in the generation of thousands of tons of residual polymeric packaging waste, which is either left behind in the environment or otherwise recycled or incinerated at a cost of several millions of U.S. dollars per year. Advancements in distributed recycling technologies now allow for on-demand reconstitution of traditionally neglected MRE pouch waste into useful appliances via material extrusion additive manufacturing. In this work, we demonstrate recycling of MRE pouch materials through a combined compounding, filament extrusion, and fused filament fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing protocol. Mechanical properties and barrier properties of additively manufactured structures were evaluated through tensile testing and water vapor transmission testing, respectively, and found to be comparable to the native pouch materials. Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Thermogravimetric Analysis of the extruded filament and printed materials were contrasted with native pouch materials, showing minimal effects of the manufacturing process on critical thermal transitions in the polymer. Economics and viability of on-demand reconstitution using these proposed methods are briefly discussed and reveal the multiple benefits of this recycling process.

The PLA phase was deformed into a microfiber structure because of the strong shear effect of extrusion-based additive manufacturing. This novel microfiber could not only reinforce considerably the matrix but was also beneficial to the shape memory property. When stretched at an appropriate temperature, the samples could maintain their deformation after cooling and recover automatically after thermal stimulation. Thus, a high-efficiency method to create 4D-printed samples by extrusion-based additive manufacturing is proposed. The effects of phase morphology and molecule structure on the shape memory cycle are also discussed.

The influence of printing parameters on multi-material two-photon polymerisation based micro additive manufacturing	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Two-photon polymerisation; Printing parameters; Micro additive manufacturing; Multi-material printing	MICROSTRUCTURES; INITIATORS	Two-photon polymerisation (2PP) based additive manufacturing has emerged as a powerful technology to fabricate complex three-dimensional micro- and nanoscale architectures. However, a comprehensive understanding of the effect of printing parameters on the functional properties of these structures is needed to unleash the potential of 2PP and enable controlled deposition / integration of various materials into multi-material structures. In this study we investigate the correlation between printing parameters, resin composition and the final properties of 2PP structures fabricated with different monomers and initiators. The link between 2PP process and final material properties is validated by morphological studies, vibrational spectroscopy and advanced mass spectrometry, ToF-SIMS, imaging. We establish empirical relationships between printing parameters and mechanical properties, and achieve controlled deposition of different monomers with high precision and uniform composition. The approaches developed here are successfully used to demonstrate multi-material 2PP and produce complex 3D architectures incorporating three polymers. The 2PP structures produced can be transferred into solution or onto different substrates, in addition to direct fabrication on flexible substrates. This work advances the understanding of the 2PP process, which enable rational design and manufacture of complex geometries and additive manufacturing of nanoscale multi-material structures.

Fiber-Reinforced Composite Sandwich Structures by Co-Curing with Additive Manufactured Epoxy Lattices	JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES SCIENCE			English	Article						composite materials; composite structures; additive manufacturing; experimental studies; polymer composites; digital light synthesis	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES	In this paper, a new process of joining additive manufactured (AM) lattice structures and carbon fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRPs) to manufacture hybrid lattice sandwich structures without secondary bonding is investigated. Multiple variations of lattice structures are designed and 3D printed using Digital Light Synthesis (DLS) and a two-stage (B-stage) epoxy resin system. The resulting lattice structures are only partially cured and subsequently thermally co-cured with pre-impregnated carbon fiber reinforcement. The mechanical properties of the additive manufactured lattice structures are characterized by compressive tests. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of hybrid lattice sandwich structures are assessed by flexural beam testing. From compressive testing of the additive manufactured lattice structures, high specific strength can be ascertained. The mechanical behavior shows these lattice structures to be suitable for use as sandwich core materials. Flexural beam testing of hybrid lattice sandwich structures shows high strength and stiffness. Furthermore, the strength of the co-cured bond interface is high enough to surpass the strength of the lattice core.

Like most natural fillers in 3D printing, wood particles serve mainly as a filler that lowers the cost of the printing material due to their low price. However, could wood be used as a main ingredient to affect/improve the properties of 3D-printed parts? Several advantages, such as its reinforcing ability, biodegradability, availability as waste material from other industries, ability to be used in different forms or only in partial components, recycling options or even the use of its undesirable hydromorph-induced dimensional instability for 4D printing, indicate the importance of exploring its use in 3D printing. A review of publications on 3D printing with wood biomass and technologies involving the use of wood particles and components was conducted to identify the possibilities of using wood in additive technologies and their potential.

Additive manufacturing (AM) offers promising prospects in the realm of conductive polymer composites by allowing for greater design flexibility, more complicated shapes, and rapid manufacturing. In addition, a rising number of additive manufacturing (AM) methods, including material extrusion, vat photopolymerization, material and binder jetting, powder bed fusion, and sheet lamination are now available for the 3D printing of conductive polymer composites. In this article, we present an insight into current research advances in the field of conductive polymer composites developed for additive manufacturing, which accelerate the design and development of 3D printable electrical devices. We examine various AM processes in terms of their respective limitations, address the material requirements and significant breakthroughs in 3D printing of conductive polymer composites, and discuss promising electronic applications -such as flexible electronics, energy storage and conversion devices, etc. This overview concludes with an assessment of potential future directions and themes in this developing area.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Infrared thermography of welding zones produced by polymer extrusion additive manufacturing	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Infrared (IR) thermography; Material extrusion; Fused deposition modeling (FDM); Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)		In common thermoplastic additive manufacturing (AM) processes, a solid polymer filament is melted, extruded though a rastering nozzle, welded onto neighboring layers and solidified. The temperature of the polymer at each of these stages is the key parameter governing these non-equilibrium processes, but due to its strong spatial and temporal variations, it is difficult to measure accurately. Here we utilize infrared (IR) imaging - in conjunction with necessary reflection corrections and calibration procedures - to measure these temperature profiles of a model polymer during 3D printing. From the temperature profiles of the printed layer (road) and sublayers, the temporal profile of the crucially important weld temperatures can be obtained. Under typical printing conditions, the weld temperature decreases at a rate of approximately 100 degrees C/s and remains above the glass transition temperature for approximately 1 s. These measurement methods are a first step in the development of strategies to control and model the printing processes and in the ability to develop models that correlate critical part strength with material and processing parameters.

It is sustainable with having a layer-by-layer manufacturing process contrary to the traditional material removal technology-subtractive manufacturing. However, there are still challenges on the AM technologies, which created barriers for their further applications in engineering fields. For example, materials properties including mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of the additively manufactured products are greatly affected by using different ways of AM methods and it was found as the material anisotropy phenomenon. In this study, a detailed literature review is conducted to investigate research work conducted on the material anisotropy phenomenon of additively manufactured materials. Based on research findings on material anisotropy phenomenon reported in the literature, this review paper aims to understand the nature of this phenomenon, address main factors and parameters influencing its severity on thermal, electrical and mechanical properties of 3D printed parts, and also, explore potential methods to minimise or mitigate this unwanted anisotropy. The outcomes of this study would be able to shed a light on improving additive manufacturing technologies and material properties of additively manufactured materials.

Typically, these 3D-printed composites have a porosity of 10-30% depending on the material and the printing process parameters, which significantly reduces the quality of the part. Therefore, the additive manufacturing of load-bearing structural applications requires a proper consolidation after the printing process-the so-called 'additive fusion technology'-allowing close to zero void content in the consolidated part. By means of the upfront digital modeling of the consolidation process, a highly optimized composite component can be produced while decreasing the number of expensive prototyping iterations. In this study, advanced numerical methods are presented to describe the consolidation process of additive manufactured continuous carbon fiber reinforced composite parts based on the polyamide 12 (PA12) matrix. The simulation of the additive fusion step/consolidation provides immediate accuracy in determining the final degree of crystallization, process-induced deformation and residual stresses, final engineering constants, as well as porosity. The developed simulation workflow is demonstrated and validated with experimental data from consolidation tests on the final porosity, thickness, and fiber-volume ratio.

The work here explores the raster pattern sensitivity of the shape memory properties of two iterations of a polymer blend system composed of thermoplastic rubber and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. Tensile test specimens were fabricated in three different raster patterns through the use of material extrusion additive manufacturing and deformed at room (25 degrees C), low (-40 degrees C) and high temperatures (105 and 110 degrees C). Shape memory parameters were assessed and the shape fixation ratio was found to exhibit a sensitivity to raster pattern when deformation occurred at room and low temperatures, while the shape recovery ratio was found to be sensitive to raster pattern when deformation occurred at elevated temperatures. The influence of phase content was also explored and a decrease in rubber content led to an improvement in shape memory properties. The alignment of polymer phases with print raster direction was also found to influence raster pattern sensitivity.	[Chavez, Francisco Andrade; Siqueiros, J.

Thereby, thermoplastic materials are likely to be used. However, thermoplastics are highly dependent on the temperature and loading rate in comparison to other material classes. Therefore, it is crucial to characterise these influences on the mechanical properties. On this account, dynamic mechanical analyses to investigate the application temperature range, and tensile tests at different crosshead speeds (10(3), 10(1), 10(-1) and 10(-3) mms(-1)) were performed on various 3D-printable polymers, namely polyetheretherketone (PEEK), polylactide (PLA), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), glycol-modified poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PETG), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and polypropylene (PP). It was found that the mechanical properties of PEEK, PLA, PMMA and PETG hardly depend on temperature changes inside the human body. PVDF and PP show a significant decrease in stiffness with increasing body temperatures. Additionally, the dependency of the stiffness on the strain-rate is increasing between PLA, PP, PEEK, PETG, PMMA and PVDF. Besides the mechanical integrity of these materials (strength, stiffness and its strain-rate and temperature dependency inside the body), the materials were further ranked considering their filling density as a measure of their processability. Hence, useful information for the selection of possible medical applications for each material and the design process of 3D-printed implants are provided.

Importance of Polymer Rheology on Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing: Correlating Process Physics to Print Properties	ACS APPLIED POLYMER MATERIALS			English	Review						3D printing; material extrusion; polymer rheology; die swell; interlayer adhesion; polymer diffusion	FUSED-FILAMENT-FABRICATION; MELT EXTRUSION; HEAT-TRANSFER; AMORPHOUS THERMOPLASTICS; NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS; STRETCHING RHEOMETRY; EXTRUDATE SWELL; DEPOSITION FLOW; BEHAVIOR; MODEL	Recent advances in the field of additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing, have garnered serious interest for its potential to substitute time-consuming and costly subtractive and formative manufacturing techniques. Material extrusion (MatEx), employing filament and pelletbased feedstocks, is an AM technique for fabricating three-dimensional objects dictated by a computer-aided design (CAD) file in a layer-by-layer manner. Being inherently a "melt-and-form" technique, the physics of MatEx is strongly dependent on the melt flow behavior of the polymers and hence on their rheology. The focus of this review article is to analyze the current progress in rheological characterizations of filament and pellet-based polymeric feedstocks for application in MatEx. The importance of shear and temperature-dependent viscosities in relation to consistent extrusion through the print nozzle and in the standoff region between nozzle and bed will be highlighted. The importance of shear and/or extensional viscosities and extent of die swell (upon exit from the nozzle) experienced by the polymers under processing parameters relevant to MatEx will be investigated. Postextrusion from the nozzle, the rheological characteristics of the viscous polymer melt as it cools once deposited on the print bed governs the degree of interlayer welding, that impacts the mechanical performance of the printed parts. Controlling and monitoring rheological properties such as zero-shear viscosities and shear moduli of the melt is of significant importance in this region in order to ensure proper mechanical robustness and shape integrity of the deposited layers. Both experimental and theoretical approaches based on polymer chain reptation mechanisms will be reviewed in detail and suggestions to address the existing limitations associated with the process will be provided. Fundamental understanding of the correlation between the classical theories and current understanding based on recent experimentation and analysis is expected to assist the design and development of the next generation of polymer feedstocks and machine designs for MatEx-based AM.

J	Sharma, S; Gupta, V; Mudgal, D				Sharma, Shrutika; Gupta, Vishal; Mudgal, Deepa			Current trends, applications, and challenges of coatings on additive manufacturing based biopolymers: A state of art review	POLYMER COMPOSITES			English	Review						additive manufacturing; bioactivity; bioadditive; coatings; osseointegration; polymers	NICKEL ELECTROLESS DEPOSITION; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS; SURFACE MODIFICATION; PLA FILAMENT; BIOMATERIALS; FIXATION; FILMS; FRACTURES; IMPLANTS	Healing of bone fractures highly depends on the biocompatibility, stability in biological conditions, biodegradability, technical functionality, and shelf-life of biomaterials. Metallic biomaterials offer excellent mechanical properties and biocompatibility. However, metallic bone implants result in stress shielding, release of toxic ions, excessive wear, and corrosion. Polymer materials are being explored for bone implants due to their light-weight, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and absence of stress shielding. In the new era, additive manufacturing (AM) is being preferred due to its capability of fabricating customer specific implants with minimum material wastage. However, AM based polymer implants lack in mechanical strength and biological properties. Surface modification of polymeric substrates using coatings and incorporation of bioadditives have been regarded as alternatives for improvement of mechanical and biological properties. This review discusses about various coating techniques and gives an overview about coatings and bioadditives that can be used for enhancement of properties. From the review, it is evident that reinforcement of hydroxyapatite to polylactic acid resulted in prevention of crack growth during shape recovery cycles which can be used for self-fitting implants. Coatings have been successful in enhancing hydrophilicity, mechanical properties, anti-biofouling, antibacterial and anti-coagulative properties, adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of cells on the coated surface. This review also discusses the challenges that need to be overcome for progression in this field.

To respond to shipping market needs, this new process is being developed. FAM technology is a conventional three-dimensional (3D) printing process whereby layers are deposited onto a high-pressure head mounted on a six-axis robotic arm. Traditionally, molds and masters are made with computer numerical control (CNC) machining or finished by hand. Handcrafting the molds is obviously time-consuming and labor-intensive, but even CNC machining can be challenging for parts with complex geometries and tight deadlines. Design/methodology/approach The proposed FAM technology focuses on the masters and molds, that are directly produced by 3D printing. This paper describes an additive manufacturing technology through which the operator can create a large part and its tools using the capacities of this new FAM technology. Findings The study shows a comparison carried out between the traditional manufacturing process and the additive manufacturing process, which is illustrated through an industrial case of application in the manufacturing industry. This work details the application of FAM technology to fabricate a 2.5 m boat hull mold and the results show the time and cost savings of FAM in the fabrication of large molds. Originality/value Finally, the advantages and drawbacks of the FAM technology are then discussed and novel features such as monitoring system and control to improve the accuracy of partly printed are highlighted.

Additive manufacturing of PLA/HNT nanocomposites for biomedical applications	29TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FLEXIBLE AUTOMATION AND INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING (FAIM 2019): BEYOND INDUSTRY 4.0: INDUSTRIAL ADVANCES, ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING	Procedia Manufacturing		English	Proceedings Paper	29th International Conference on Flexible Automation and Intelligent Manufacturing (FAIM) - Beyond Industry 4.0 - Industrial Advances, Engineering Education and Intelligent Manufacturing	JUN 24-28, 2019	Limerick, IRELAND			Additive manufacturing; Fused Filament Fabrication; biodegradable stents; polylactic acid; halloysite nanotubes	HALLOYSITE	Additive manufacturing has been of great interest of research in various applications due to their ease in processability, cost effectiveness and adaptability. In this study Poly Lactic Acid (PLA) was used as the base polymer which was reinforced with Halloysite Nanotubes (HINT) powder as they are known to be biodegradable and has high mechanical properties individually. HINT loadings with 3% and 5% were added to PLA by the method of twin screw extrusion and pelletized. For comparison, the PLA on its own was also extruded and pelletized. The resultant homogeneous pellets was extruded successfully into filaments of 1.75 +/- 0.10 mm diameter using twin screw extruder with specialized die fixed to the extruder for the manufacture of production grade 3D printing filament. This resultant filament was utilized for Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) into standard tensile test bars and 25mm medical implants using a standard FFF printing machine. The 3D printed samples were characterized for mechanical properties by uniaxial tensile test and thermal stability by Differential scanning calorimetry. Interestingly there was no significant change in the mechanical properties of the 3D printed tensile bars due to the processing parameters during FFF. However, the decrease in cold crystallization temperature by DSC indicates the nucleating effect of the HINT on the PLA matrix which in turn increases the mechanical properties. We could successfully 3D print model medical implants. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Integration of additive manufacturing and inkjet printed electronics: a potential route to parts with embedded multifunctionality	MANUFACTURING REVIEW			English	Review						Inkjet Printing; Additive Manufacturing; Printed Electronics	CONTACT-ANGLE; CONDUCTIVE PATTERNS; LOW WEBER; DEPOSITION; DROPLET; POLYMER; FABRICATION; TRANSISTOR; LIQUID; STEREOLITHOGRAPHY	Additive manufacturing, an umbrella term for a number of different manufacturing techniques, has attracted increasing interest recently for a number of reasons, such as the facile customisation of parts, reduced time to manufacture from initial design, and possibilities in distributed manufacturing and structural electronics. Inkjet printing is an additive manufacturing technique that is readily integrated with other manufacturing processes, eminently scalable and used extensively in printed electronics. It therefore presents itself as a good candidate for integration with other additive manufacturing techniques to enable the creation of parts with embedded electronics in a timely and cost effective manner. This review introduces some of the fundamental principles of inkjet printing; such as droplet generation, deposition, phase change and post-deposition processing. Particular focus is given to materials most relevant to incorporating structural electronics and how post-processing of these materials has been able to maintain compatibility with temperature sensitive substrates. Specific obstacles likely to be encountered in such an integration and potential strategies to address them will also be discussed.

J	Estelle, KT; Gozen, BA				Estelle, Kevin T.; Gozen, B. Arda			Humidity-controlled direct ink writing for micro-additive manufacturing with water-based inks	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES			English	Article						3D bioprinting; Bioinks; Hydrogels; Extrusion-based additive manufacturing; Water-soluble polymers		Direct-ink-writing type additive manufacturing with water-based inks such as hydrogels or polymer solutions is broadly utilized for bioprinting applications. However, the resolution of this implementation is limited due to the rapid ink drying experienced at small size scales leading to nozzle clogging and low fidelity prints. To address this issue, a humidity-controlled direct-ink-writing (HCDIW) approach is presented, where the microenvironment around the printing nozzle is controlled through introduction of aerosolized water. Using this approach, the nozzle microenvironment can be varied between undersaturated yet high relative humidity (ambient to 100% RH) to oversaturated conditions where condensing droplets are deposited on the already printed ink filaments. The influence of the aerosolized water and the resultant micro-environment on the printing process was studied using water dissolved sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) ink, specifically focusing on nozzle clogging, printed filament geometry, surface quality and layer by layer stacking. These studies showed that the ink drying induced nozzle clogging issues can be mitigated through increased relative humidity at the nozzle exit and is virtually eliminated for similar to 100 mu m nozzles in oversaturated conditions. The decelerated ink drying under the effect of aerosolized water leads to reduced solute advection and skin formation. This in turn improves surface roughness while reducing adverse effects such as coffee-ring and void formation during additive manufacturing of micro-scale structures. Furthermore, layer-to-layer fusion and associated side-surface quality were improved specifically in undersaturated conditions. Reduction of deposited ink filament concentration in oversaturated conditions leads to excessive spreading of the deposited inks leading to geometric distortions. These results indicate that the humidity control approach can significantly improve the resolution of the direct-ink-writing approaches, enabling processing of water-based inks at micro-scales.

Thereby, these techniques are mainly used in order to realize mechanical components. But the additive manufacturing technology offers a high potential in the field of optics as well. Owing to new design possibilities, completely new solutions are possible. We report on the realization of complex freeform optics using standard 3D printers. We briefly point out the characteristics of 3D printing and its influence on the optical properties. Additionally we address the needed rework of 3D printed optical components. Therefore we apply two different methods - a robot-based fluid jet polishing and a coating method. The advantage of a 3D printed optic lies in its shape complexity. Thus different complex shaped optical elements are discussed. They are used for either metrology tasks or illumination tasks.

Temperature Dependent Damping in Additively Manufactured Polymer Structures	JOURNAL OF APPLIED AND COMPUTATIONAL MECHANICS			English	Article						Metastructures; Metamaterials; Temperature effects; Polymer structures; 3D printing; Additive manufacturing	FINITE-ELEMENT; VISCOELASTIC STRUCTURES; VIBRATION SUPPRESSION; METASTRUCTURES; MODEL	Temperature effects are predominantly ignored when computing the dynamic response of structures. Yet, in applications where large changes in temperature occur, the dynamic response can drastically change. This is particularly true for polymers. While the temperature effects on modulus and loss factor are often available for most polymers, this change is not addressed or corrected for. Meanwhile, the recent research on additively manufactured polymer metastructures has yet to consider the effects of temperature change on their ability to suppress vibrations. In order to fill this gap, the study presented in this paper focuses on the effects of temperature change on additively manufactured structures.

To address these limitations, a reactive extrusion AM (REAM) process is introduced, in which successive layers of a thermoset resin are deposited and cured rapidly in situ with no external energy input aside from that required to pump and position the resin. Mechanical properties of tensile specimens fabricated in multiple orientations indicate that the tensile modulus and ultimate strength are isotropic, but elongation at break and toughness depend on orientation. The isotropic properties are attributed to chemical crosslinking of polymer chains that occurs between layers of printed parts. Moreover, the tensile modulus and strength are influenced by the local thermal environment in the build, which varies within the build envelope because of the exothermic nature of the polymerization reaction and affects the degree of curing within the specimen. The degree of curing was measured via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and was commensurate with the tensile strength of the tested coupons. When coupled with a large nozzle and high material flow rates, the REAM system can create nearly isotropic structural parts substantially more quickly than other AM systems, while using appreciably less energy at the point of manufacture.

A special focus on AM to fabricate nuclear-grade silicon carbide (SiC) is explored in this paper. First, we present currently available AM processing options for SiC. AM methods commonly used for other ceramics, in which the feedstocks are forms of polymers, powders, and/or reactive chemical vapors, are also applicable to SiC. SiC phases are formed by pyrolysis of pre-ceramic polymer, direct reaction of powder precursors, sintering of SiC powders, or chemical vapor deposition/infiltration. Second, we discuss how the different microstructures of SiC materials fabricated by various processing methods affect their behavior in nuclear environments. Third, we discuss state-of-the-art AM technologies for the fabrication of relatively pure SiC, which show great potential to retain its strength under neutron irradiation: (1) binder jet printing followed by chemical vapor infiltration, (2) laser chemical vapor deposition, and (3) selective laser sintering of SiC powders.

The advancement in the resolution of AM has enabled the microfabrication of the architectures of electrodes and sensing layers for high-performance sensing. Diversiform printable materials, including biocompatible materials, polymers, various gels and metals, have enormously broadened the horizon in sensors and analytical devices for both research and commercial purposes. The considerable shortening of time and cost in sensor prototyping and fabrication has been reported and various highly customizable biosensing platforms and devices are under development. Herein, the most recent studies on the applications of AM in biosensors and bioanalytical devices are summarized with the aim to provide a panorama of emerging 3D-printing strategies for sensor design and bioanalytical device fabrication.

The preparation of an n-type polymer-based thermoelectric composite with good stability in air atmosphere via additive manufacturing holds promise for application in flexible thermoelectric devices. For WC/PLA volume ratios varying from similar to 33% to 60%, the electrical conductivity of the composites increased from 10.6 to 42.2 S/cm, while the Seebeck coefficients were in the range -11 to -12.3 V/K.

Additive manufacturing of PA12 carbon nanotube composites with a novel laser polymer deposition process	JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE			English	Article						composites; manufacturing; morphology; nanotubes; porous materials	BEHAVIOR; MICROSTRUCTURE; NANOCOMPOSITE; MECHANISM	The facile manufacture of PA12 MWCNT/silica (50/50 by weight) nanocomposite powders through a high energy mixing process is presented, which are useful to generate 3D objects by a novel Laser Polymer Deposition (LPD) process. The mixing as well as the LPD process led to no discernible changes in the material properties (DSC, SEM, LD) of the core-shell nanocomposites, enabling the recycling of unconverted powder. The built parts yield ultimate tensile stresses and Young's modulus at 10%-20% of the bulk material. Partially unmolten particles and voids were identified as the main mechanical failure mechanism in the built parts. The mechanical properties are better with low additive content (Young's modulus: 89.8 +/- 5.4 MPa; UTS: 12.9 +/- 5.3 MPa with 0.25 wt% additives). Electronic conductivity up to the region of moderate conductivity could be achieved by multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) network formation (8 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 1.25 wt% of additives). A variant of the processing strategy revealed that a higher mechanical strength can be achieved by a laser induced remelting of the traces following their initial construction.

J	Ramaraju, RV; Chandra, S				Ramaraju, Ramgopal Varma; Chandra, Sanjeev			Additive Manufacturing of Metal Components by Thermal Spray Deposition on 3D-Printed Polymer Parts	JOURNAL OF THERMAL SPRAY TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						3D printing; additive manufacturing; internal channels; rapid prototyping; thermal spray	COLD SPRAY; METALLIZATION; COMPOSITE; COATINGS	Metals were deposited using wire-arc spray-on components made by 3D printing with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a water-soluble polymer. The polymer was then dissolved, leaving a metal layer whose surface topography was negative to that of the polymer. This is a rapid and low-cost alternative to 3D printing directly using metal, but to succeed it is essential for the sprayed metal to adhere to the polymer substrate. Tests were done in which aluminum and copper were sprayed using a twin-wire arc spray system onto 3D printed coupons, 50 x 50 mm in size, made from PVA, polylactic acid (PLA), and PLA mixed with metal (aluminum, copper) or carbon fiber. Adhesion depended on substrate roughness (minimum 1-2 mu m) substrate temperature (above the glass transition temperature but below the melting temperature of the polymer) and minimizing residual stresses due to mismatch of the thermal expansion coefficients of metal and polymer. It was shown that surface features could be made on metal components using this technique. Plates with internal flow passages were made by placing 3D printed PVA parts in channels machined in the plates, spraying metal over the polymer, and then dissolving the polymer.

Compared with classical manufacturing technologies, AM offers the advantages of reducing weight and improving performance and offers excellent design capabilities for prototyping and rapid sample manufacture. To achieve its full potential regarding cost, durability, material consumption, and rigidity, as well as maintaining competitiveness, there are several research directions that have not been explored. One less frequently explored direction is the involvement of dimensional methods in obtaining an optimal and competitive final product. In this review, we intend to discuss the ways in which dimensional methods, such as geometric analogy, similarity theory, and dimensional analysis, are involved in addressing the problems of AM. To the best of our knowledge, it appears that this field of engineering has not fully maximized the advantages of these dimensional methods to date. In this review, we survey mainly polymer-based AM technology. We focus on the design and optimization of highly competitive products obtained using AM and also on the optimization of layer deposition, including their orientation and filling characteristics. With this contribution to the literature, we hope to suggest a fruitful direction for specialists involved in AM to explore the possibilities of modern dimensional analysis.

One of the primary disadvantages of these composite materials is their high cost due to labor-intensive manufacturing. Because the fiber path can be steered directly along the load path, structures can be manufactured in a near-net shape, and a high degree of reproducibility with low scrap rates can be achieved. Additive manufacturing of these composite structures could enable cost efficiency with a high degree of complexity. However, the high degree of porosity and high void content between the printed fiber filaments results in unacceptable structural performance. Following the printing process, a post-consolidation process (additive fusion) can be performed to improve the mechanical performance of the part and use fiber-reinforced polymers for load-bearing applications. Numerical simulation of the consolidation process enables the production of these complex parts without expensive prototyping iterations. Because of the rapid and local changes in material stiffness, the simulation of the consolidation process is combined with a set of numerical model convergence problems. An advanced finite-element numerical model for simulating the consolidation process of additive manufactured continuous fiber composite parts is presented in this paper. The additive fusion step simulation allows for the evaluation of process-induced deformations, final engineering constants, and porosity. The simulation workflow is demonstrated and validated using experimental data from the manufacturing process of a typical aerospace part, specifically a helicopter hinge element.

Dynamic fracture behaviour of additively manufactured polymers and composites under ballistic impact	4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (ICSI 2021)	Procedia Structural Integrity		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Structural Integrity (ICSI)	AUG 30-SEP 02, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK			Additive Manufacturing; Ballisitic Impact; Dynamic Fracture; Numerical Modelling; Polymer Composite		Recent technological advancements led to active research in the field of additive manufacturing (AM) thanks to its ability to fabricate complex structures with reduced material waste. While many studies focused on quasi-static performance of AM materials and structures, investigations on the dynamic performance of these materials are still limited, especially for polymers and composites. The aim of this research is to investigate the dynamic fracture behaviour of AM polymer composites under ballistic impact. Nylon reinforced with short carbon fibres was selected, and fused deposition modelling was used to fabricate solid quasi-isotropic structures. Quasi-static tensile and compression tests were carried out based on ASTM standards to characterise the elastic-plastic properties of the manufactured material. Based on these tests, the material's deformation and fracture behaviour can be considered elastic-brittle. Further, dynamic mechanical analysis was conducted under a frequency sweep at room temperature to examine the viscoelastic properties; the material exhibited high elastic behaviour. Then, ballistic impact tests were performed on solid plates using a gas gun with 9 mm spherical steel projectiles at velocities ranging from 95 m s(-1) to 120 m s(-1). Post-experimental observation revealed the complete target perforation, with a circular hole at the front of the plates and delamination at the back. The dynamic experimental conditions were reproduced within the finite-element simulations, employing Hashin damage criteria via a user subroutine. A similar perforation was achieved at the front of the plate. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A review of the techniques used to characterize laser sintering of polymeric powders for use and re-use in additive manufacturing	MANUFACTURING REVIEW			English	Review						Additive manufacturing; characterization of LS polymeric powder; re-use of polymeric powder; LS		Additive manufacturing (AM), is one of the key components of the 4th industrial revolution. Polymer laser sintering (PLS) is a subset of AM that is commonly used to process polymers, and which achieves good surface finish, good mechanical properties of finished products and for which there is no need for support structures. However, the requirements for polymeric powder for PLS are strident. Moreover, PLS subjects polymeric feed powders to high temperatures that lead to degradation of their thermal, rheological, and physical properties and is thus an impediment to their recyclability. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the degree of polymer degradation or aging before re-using the material. This paper reviews the common techniques that are employed to characterize the suitability of polymeric powders for use and re-use in the PLS process. These include, but are not limited to, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), laser diffraction analysis, gas pycnometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and melt flow index (MFI) testing.

Due to variations in temperature during the manufacturing process and the resulting stress between the stacked layers, the final parts show anisotropic mechanical properties. One possible approach for their reduction is the immediate local preheating of the surface via laser radiation. At first, our research examines the influence of laser parameters as wavelength, power, velocity and area of impact for the preheating of the surface. In addition, an overview of possible parameter combinations is given based on the selection of raw materials, its colors, thicknesses and the manufacturing process. Initially, the absorption level of the materials regarding the emitted wavelength is detected using a spectrophotometer. Subsequently, preheating tests are conducted with different laser types while the temperature is determined by a thermal camera. The selected laser type is planned to get mounted on a prototype-machine for further in-situ preheating experiments on FLM parts during the manufacturing process. (C) 2018 The Authors.

However, the limited choice of available materials tends to limit its application domain. Addition of nanoparticles can significantly improve the material properties of the AM parts. Moreover, nanoparticles can be added in different stages of the process which will play an important role in determining the increase in material properties. This aspect of the stage-dependent addition of nanoparticles in AM process has not been fully explored. The present work discusses the effect of adding nanoclay in three stages of AM process namely preprocessing, on-site and post-processing stage. It has been found that the nanoparticles interact in a different way with the polymer and result in different structure, morphology and mesostructure of the nanocomposites. The approach can be utilized for achieving improved material properties of AM-fabricated parts.

J	Wang, ZG				Wang, Zhaogui			Exploring the applicability of a simplified fully coupled flow/orientation algorithm developed for polymer composites extrusion deposition additive manufacturing	INTERNATIONAL POLYMER PROCESSING			English	Article						extrusion deposition additive manufacturing; flow/orientation coupling effects; polymer composites; scalar representation; simplified fully coupled algorithm	FIBER ORIENTATION; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; NOZZLE GEOMETRY; FLOW; SUSPENSIONS; BEHAVIOR; SWELL; MODEL	Prior literature employed a finite element based fully coupled algorithm that solved the flow/orientation coupling effects in extrusion deposition additive manufacturing, i.e., a key component for identifying the material properties of solidified deposited polymer composites. However, the complex iterative solution protocol reduces the computational capability of the algorithm. This paper simplifies the finite element based fully coupled algorithm by employing a scalar representation of the fourth order orientation tensor affected viscosity tensor. The revised code predicts similar fiber orientation results as compared to a related prior study. With the simplified fully coupled algorithm, effects of material deposition rate and fiber aspect ratio on a 2D planar large area extrusion deposition flow are explored, where the power law rheology model is employed for the flow simulation. Computed results show that an increased material deposition rate reduces the extrudate-swell ratio of the melt front and varies the local fiber orientation of the deposited bead especially near the flow region in contact with the substrate. Higher fiber aspect ratio enhances the principal fiber alignment of the extrusion and deposition flows, where the maximum local difference of the principal A(11) component is 23% with increasing fiber aspect ratio from 10 to 25.

J	Baturynska, I				Baturynska, Ivanna			Statistical analysis of dimensional accuracy in additive manufacturing considering STL model properties	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Statistical analysis; Polymer powder bed process; Dimensional accuracy; STL model parameters; Regression modeling	SHRINKAGE COMPENSATION; PROCESS PARAMETERS; OPTIMIZATION	Additive manufacturing (AM) is a technology that produces a part layer by layer based on the computer-aided designed (CAD) model. Each AM process is defined by a set of parameters and materials. The laser power, scan spacing and speed, preheating and bed temperatures, hatch length, pulse frequency, and part placement (coordinates of a part placed in the build) are among the most studied process parameters reported in the literature. Recent attention to improving part quality is caused by the possibility of using AM for manufacturing, but the inconsistency of results' repeatability is the main challenge that is not solved yet. This work attempts to improve the dimensional accuracy by predicting dimensional features of the part, namely length, width, and thickness. Data is collected from two identical runs done on EOS P395 polymer laser sintering system. By identical runs is meant that build layout, material and process parameters were kept constant in both runs. Pearson correlation test is used to identify whether the new parameters (the number of mesh triangles, surface, and volume of CAD model) are significantly correlated to dimensional features. Based on the correlation results, linear regression models are developed to predict dimensional features (compensate shrinkage effect). The obtained results are the following: models for thickness (in XZY orientation), length (in ZYX orientation), and length and thickness (in Angle orientation) can already be used to predict dimensional features (to minimize shrinkage effect by proposing scaling ratio for each specimen in the build separately).

Additive manufacturing (AM) techniques provide a new revolution in manufacturing by expanding freedom for design and fabrication for complex geometries. One way to overcome these problems is by developing novel polymer-based composite materials with improved thermal conductivity properties for AM technologies. In this review, the fundamental principles of designing high thermal conductive polymer nanocomposites are presented. High thermal conductive polymer nanocomposites generally consist of the base polymer and thermally conductive filler materials such as aluminum oxide or boron nitride which are reviewed in detail. The factors affecting the thermal conductivity of composites, such as the filler loading and overall composite structure, are also summarized. This article stands on statistical data from technical papers published during 2000-2020 about the topics of fused deposition modeling (FDM) polymers or their thermal conductive composites. Finally, the most critical factors affecting the thermal conductivity of polymer nanocomposites are described in detail. Nonetheless, various novel techniques show the potential abilities of thermal conductivity of polymer nanocomposites usage by AM technologies, enabling applications in LED devices, energy, and electronic packaging.

Polymer recycling codes for distributed manufacturing with 3-D printers	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						3-D printing; Additive manufacturing; Recycling codes; Polymers; Distributed manufacturing	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; WASTE MANAGEMENT; ASSESSMENT LCA; FEEDSTOCK; PLASTICS; REPRAP; SYSTEM; DEBRIS; IMPACT	With the aggressive cost reductions for 3-D printing made available by the open-source self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) the economic advantage of custom distributed manufacturing has become substantial. In addition, the number of free designs is growing exponentially and the development and commercialization of the recyclebot (plastic extruders that fabricate 3-D printing filament from recycled or virgin materials) have greatly improved the material selection available for prosumer 3-D printer operators. These trends indicate that more individuals will manufacturer their own polymer products, however, there is a risk that an even larger fraction of polymer waste will not be recycled because it has not been coded. The current limited resin identification code available in the U.S. similarly restricts closing the loop on less popular polymers, which could hamper the environmental impact benefits of distributed manufacturing. This paper provides a solution for this challenge by (1) developing a recycling code model based off of the resin identification codes developed in China that is capable of expansion as more complex 3-D printing materials are introduced, (2) creating OpenSCAD scripts based on (1) to be used to print resin identification codes into products, (3) demonstrating the use of this functionality in a selection of products and polymer materials, and (4) outlining the software and policy tools necessary to make this application possible for widespread adoption. Overall the results showed that a far larger resin code identification system can be adopted in the U.S. to expand distributed recycling of polymers and manufacturing of plastic-based 3-D printed products.

Quadruple Hydrogen Bonding Supramolecular Elastomers for Melt Extrusion Additive Manufacturing	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						quadruple hydrogen bonding; supramolecular polymer; extrusion additive manufacturing; microphase separation; rheology; mechanical property	UREIDO-CYTOSINE; IONIC LIQUIDS; POLYMERS; DEPOSITION; MONOMERS; NETWORK; DESIGN; TOUGH	This manuscript describes the versatility of highly directional, noncovalent interactions, i.e., quadruple hydrogen bonding (QHB), to afford novel polyurea segmented supramolecular polymers for melt extrusion three-dimensional (3D) printing processes. The molecular design of the polyurea elastomers features (1) flexible polyether segments and relatively weak urea hydrogen-bonding sites in the soft segments to provide elasticity and toughness, and (2) strong ureido-cytosine (UCyt) QHB in the hard segments to impart enhanced mechanical integrity. The resulting polyureas were readily compression-molded into mechanically-robust, transparent, and creasable films. Optimization of polyurea composition offered a rare combination of high tensile strength (95 MPa), tensile elongation (788% strain), and toughness (94 MJ/m(3)), which are superior to a commercially available Ninjaflex elastomer. The incorporation of QHB facilitated melt processability, where hydrogen bonding dissociation provided low viscosities at printing temperatures. During cooling, directional self-assembly of UCyt QHB facilitated the solidification process and contributed to part fidelity with the formation of a robust physical network. The printed objects displayed high layer fidelity, smooth surfaces, minimal warpage, and complex geometries. The presence of highly directional QHB effectively diminished mechanical anisotropy, and the printed samples exhibited comparable Young's moduli along (x-y direction, 0 degrees) and perpendicular to (z-direction, 90 degrees) the layer direction. Remarkably, the printed samples exhibited ultimate tensile strains approaching 500% in the z-direction prior to failure, which was indicative of improved interlayer adhesion. Thus, this design paradigm, which is demonstrated for novel polyurea copolymers, suggests the potential of supramolecular polymers with enhanced mechanical performance, melt processability, recydability, and improved interlayer adhesion for melt extrusion additive manufacturing processes.

Analysis of Multi-scale Mechanical Properties of Ceramic Trusses Prepared from Preceramic Polymers (Revision Prepared for <i>Additive Manufacturing</i>)	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Preceramic Polymer; Vat Photopolymerization; Truss; Mechanical Properties; Shrinkage	STEREOLITHOGRAPHY	To better understand the impact of complex structure on mechanical properties in additively manufactured ceramics, truss structures were 3D printed in preceramic polymer and mechanically evaluated in the pyrolyzed SiOC state. Specimens were printed using digital light processing with a siloxane polymer resin blend. Four different designs were printed: two bending-dominant Kelvin cell structures, a stretching-dominant octet structure, and a mixture of the two with geometries chosen for equivalent stiffness. Mechanical characterization was done at multiple length scales: uniaxial compression to evaluate the entire truss structure, and three-point flexure to assess individual beam elements. After pyrolysis, it was found that truss designs exhibited different shrinkages at the beam element scale despite being composed of the same preceramic polymer and exhibiting isotropic shrinkage at the macro-truss scale. This manner of nonuniform shrinkage has rarely, if ever been reported, as it is standard practice in additive manufacturing to report only bulk linear shrinkage. In uniaxial compression, Kelvin structures with thicker beams exhibited the highest strength of 10 MPa, and octet structures exhibited the lowest strength of 3.8 MPa. In beam element flexure however, the octet beams had the highest strength, 1.9 GPa, four times stronger than the Kelvin beam elements and 500 times stronger than the octet bulk structure. Lastly, the implications for interchangeable truss structures are discussed.	[Brodnik, N. R.; Faber, K.

One of the commercial AM techniques is Binder-jetting (BJ). This technique can be used to process a variety of materials including stainless steel, ceramic, polymer and glass. However, there is very limited research about this AM technology on energy consumption aspect. This paper presents a method to build an energy consumption model for printing stage of BJ process. Mathematical analyses are performed to find out the correlation between the energy consumption and geometry of the manufactured part. Based on the analyses, total energy consumption is calculated as a function of part geometry and printing parameters. Finally, test printing is performed to check the accuracy of the model. This process model provides a tool to optimise part geometry design with respect to energy consumption.

To fabricate the micromanipulator, we developed an additive manufacturing system based on high-resolution microstereolithography using a 405-nm blue laser. The fabrication system makes it possible to fabricate 3D microstructures on a glass capillary with 2.5 mu m lateral resolution and 25 mu m layer thickness. We also demonstrated the capture and release of a spheroid with the micromanipulator fabricated using our additive manufacturing system. We showed that spheroids can be easily handled by a simple operation with minimal damage using a cage-like multiple finger structure. Additive manufacturing of tailor-made micromanipulators mounted on a glass capillary will be useful in biological and tissue engineering research.

J	Huang, HH; Liu, WH; Liu, ZF				Huang, Haihong; Liu, Weihao; Liu, Zhifeng			Additive manufacturing-inspired approach to re-manufacture fiber reinforced plastic with programmable orientation of recycled carbon fiber	COMPOSITES COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						CFRP; Additive manufacturing; Laminates; Re-manufacture	POLYMERS	The carbon fiber recycled from end-of-life Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) offers a low-cost and environmentally friendly option to produce CFRP parts. However, the reclaimed carbon fibers (rCFs) are usually in a discontinuous and disordered form, which limits the performance of fiber-filled composite. An additive manufacturing-inspired approach is proposed to re-manufacture CFRP, in which the rCFs were dispersed and orderly deposited to form a slice of pre-defined rCF sheet with programmable fiber orientation, then the rCF sheets were stuck layer by layer to fabricate aligned rCF reinforced plastic (rCFRP). Experiments show that preferential alignment degree, flexible strength and electric conductivity of designedly aligned rCFRP were 0.96, 393.53 MPa and 7.23 x 10-1 S/cm, respectively, which are significantly higher than the unoriented rCFRP (0.28, 217.59 MPa and 1.07 x 10-2 S/cm). This approach paves the way for additively fabricating rCFRP parts with customized performance by arranging rCFs orientation.

Researchers at AUT University in New Zealand and the National University of Singapore have developed a novel Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process in which the layers of material that make up the part are deposited as curved layers instead of the conventional flat layers. This technology opens up possibilities of building curved plastic parts that have conductive electronic tracks and components printed as an integral part of the plastic component, thereby eliminating printed circuit boards and wiring. It is not possible to do this with existing flat-layer additive manufacturing technologies as the continuity of a circuit could be interrupted between the layers. With curved-layer fused deposition modeling (CLFDM) this problem is removed as continuous filaments in 3 dimensions can be produced, allowing for continuous conductive circuits.

In this study, a single-stage light gas gun is used to impact cube-shaped specimens, 40 mm on a side, instrumented with photon Doppler velocimeter (PDV) light probes to capture free surface velocities and side-looking high-speed video to capture deformation history. A combined Eulerian-Lagrangian finite element (FE) model has been developed which reproduces the majority of the observed experimental trends, based on an independently-measured shock Hugoniot for the bulk AM polymer. After initial calibration, the FE model has been used to suggest candidate geometries for experimental investigation, based on the desired shock response. Geometries for structurally-efficient shock mitigation have been investigated. In a separate set of experiments, miniature (6 mm x 6 mm) square specimens have been impacted at the Dynamic Compression Sector at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), and imaged using x-ray Phase Contrast Imaging (PCI). This technique gives strong evidence for the propagation of discrete shocks within the engineered foam structures, in agreement with our models.

Optimization Methodology for Additive Manufacturing of Customized Parts by Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). Application to a Shoe Heel	POLYMERS			English	Article						additive manufacturing; optimization; parametric design; infill optimization; mass customizing; biomechanics; FDM		Additive manufacturing technologies offer important new manufacturing possibilities, but its potential is so big that only with the support of other technologies can it really be exploited. In that sense, parametric design and design optimization tools appear as two appropriate complements for additive manufacturing. Synergies existing between these three technologies allow for integrated approaches to the design of customized and optimized products. While additive manufacturing makes it possible to materialize overly complex geometries, parametric design allows designs to be adapted to custom characteristics and optimization helps to choose the best solution according to the objectives. This work represents an application development of a previous work published in Polymers which exposed the general structure, operation and opportunities of a methodology that integrates these three technologies by using visual programming with Grasshopper. In this work, the different stages of the methodology and the way in which each one modifies the final design are exposed in detail, applying it to a case study: the design of a shoe heel for FDM-an interesting example both from the perspectives of ergonomic and mass customization. Programming, operation and results are exposed in detail showing the complexity, usefulness and potential of the methodology, with the aim of helping other researchers to develop proposals in this line.

However, when these structures are needed with thins walls and struts, AM processes may encounter difficulties in properly manufacturing these structures due to their capability limits. This study proposes to characterize the manufacturing of random architected structures to see firstly their fabricability and the capability of the additive manufacturing processes used, such as vat photopolymerization (Stereolithography process (SLA)), material extrusion (Fused Filament Fabrication process (FFF)) and powder bed fusion (Selective Laser Sintering process (SLS)) through tomographic, dimensional, and mass analysis. Several defects specific to each process were identified. A higher predominance of porosities, lack of printing and excess of material manifests as trapped or partially fused powder for SLS and angel hair for FFF. These defects strongly affect the dimensional and geometric accuracy of the struts and, thus, the final mass of the structure obtained with these two processes. The SLA process makes it possible to print thinner details of random architected structures with better material quality and good dimensional and geometric accuracy, under the conditions and protocol used in this study.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis highlighteda fiber transversal cross-section morphology characterized by a denseexternal skin layer and an inner macroporous/microporous structure,as a consequence of the nonsolvent-induced polymer solidificationprocess. Physical-chemical and thermal characterization of the fabricatedsamples demonstrated that PSU processing did not affect its macromolecularstructure and glass-transition temperature, as well as that afterpost-processing PSU implants did not contain residual solvent or nonsolvent.Mechanical characterization showed that the developed PSU scaffoldtensile and compressive modulus could be changed by varying the macroporousarchitecture. In addition, PSU scaffolds supported the in vitro adhesionand proliferation of the BALB/3T3 clone A31 mouse embryo cell line.These findings encourage further research on the suitability of thedeveloped processing method for the fabrication of customized PSUimplants.

More importantly, AM enables the design and fabrication of complex and functional stent unit cells that would otherwise be impossible to realize with conventional manufacturing techniques. Additionally, AM makes fast design iterations possible while also shortening the development time of vascular stents. This has led to the emergence of a new treatment paradigm in which custom and on-demand-fabricated stents will be used for just-in-time treatments. This review is focused on the recent advances in AM vascular stents aimed at meeting the mechanical and biological requirements. First, the biomaterials suitable for AM vascular stents are listed and briefly described. Second, we review the AM technologies that have been so far used to fabricate vascular stents as well as the performances they have achieved. Subsequently, the design criteria for the clinical application of AM vascular stents are discussed considering the currently encountered limitations in materials and AM techniques. Finally, the remaining challenges are highlighted and some future research directions are proposed to realize clinically-viable AM vascular stents.Vascular stents have been widely used for the treatment of vascular disease. The recent progress in addi-tive manufacturing (AM) has provided unprecedented opportunities for revolutionizing traditional vascu-lar stents. In this manuscript, we review the applications of AM to the design and fabrication of vascular stents. This is an interdisciplinary subject area that has not been previously covered in the published review articles. Our objective is to not only present the state-of-the-art of AM biomaterials and technolo-gies but to also critically assess the limitations and challenges that need to be overcome to speed up the clinical adoption of AM vascular stents with both anatomical superiority and mechanical and biological functionalities that exceed those of the currently available mass-produced devices.& COPY; 2023 Acta Materialia Inc.

Thermoplastic build materials composed of dendritic block copolymers were designed, synthesized, and used to additively manufacture plastic parts exhibiting structural color. The reflection properties of the photonic crystals arise from the periodic nanostructure formed through block copolymer self-assembly during polymer processing. The wavelength, of reflected light could be tuned across the visible spectrum by synthetically controlling the block copolymer molecular weight and manufacture parts that reflected violet, green, or orange light with the capacity to serve as selective optical filters and light guides.

Fused filament fabrication, the most common form of material extrusion additive manufacturing, enables the production of custom-made parts with complex geometry. Despite the numerous advantages of additive manufacturing, reliability, reproducibility, and achievement of isotropic bulk properties in part remains challenging. We investigated the tensile behavior of a model polycarbonate system to explore what leads to different tensile properties, including sources of ductile versus brittle fracture. We utilized a one factor at a time (OFAT) design of experiments (DOE), printed single road-width boxes, and performed tensile tests on specimens from these boxes. Additionally, we characterized the cross-sections of parts printed under different conditions and their subsequent fracture behavior. The results demonstrate that isotropic bulk properties are achievable by printing at high speeds, and provide mechanisms to explain why.HighlightsPrinting at high speeds leads to improved mechanical properties.Printed samples undergo a mix of ductile and brittle failure.Jagged fracture path is associated with superior adhesion.High layer times lead to worse interfacial bonding.

Realization of the full potential of such novel systems relies heavily on their effective manufacturing. Particularly, there is a need for manufacturing techniques that can realize complex designs, consisting of multiple functional materials which are required for sensor functionality. Among emerging additive manufacturing techniques, Direct-Ink-Writing (DIW), where polymer nanocomposite inks are dispensed through nozzles and deposited with high spatial control, carries a great potential to address this need. Here, we introduce a 3D printed flexible electrochemical biosensor for glucose detection. We show that our biosensor works linearly in glucose solution with a concentration range between 100 and 1000 mM. The sensitivity of glucose biosensor is estimated to be 17.5 nA mu M-1, and the calculated value of the detection limit (S/N = 3) is 6.9 mu M. The demonstrated electrochemical performance and surface properties of the printed sensors show the promising advantages of using this technique over the conventional screen printing method. These advantages include higher sensitivity and specificity and, reduced material consumption. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Test specimens were 3D-printed using commercial polylactic acid (PLA) filament, and PLA filament reinforced with short-carbon fibers (PLA/CF). As-printed specimens and specimens that were annealed at three different temperatures, then subjected to tensile testing. The internal microstructures of the samples were also examined. The effects of the short-carbon fiber fillers on the mechanical properties of 3D-printed PLA were investigated, and the effects of the annealing process on polymer crystallinity and mechanical properties. The annealing process was shown to increase the crystallinity of both sample groups, though no statistically significant effect of annealing on mechanical properties was observed. The tensile properties of the PLA and PLA/CF filaments showed that the addition of carbon fibers to the PLA filament led to a significant increase in elastic modulus of the MEAM samples.

For this purpose, the influence of modified fillers, such as silica modified with alumina, bentonite modified with quaternary ammonium salt, and hybrid filler lignin/silicon dioxide, on the functional properties of composites based on glycol-modified poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET-G) was investigated. In the first part of the work, using the proprietary technological line, filaments from unfilled polymer and its composites were obtained, which contained modified fillers in an amount from 1.5% to 3.0% by weight. The fittings for the testing of functional properties were obtained using the 3D printing technique in the Melted and Extruded Manufacturing (MEM) technology and the injection molding technique. In a later part of the work, rheological properties such as mass melt flow rate (MFR) and viscosity, and mechanical properties such as Rockwell hardness, Charpy impact strength, and static tensile strength with Young's modulus were presented. The structure of the obtained composites was also described and determined using scanning electron microscopy with an attachment for the microanalysis of chemical composition (SEM/EDS) and the atomic force microscope (AFM). The correct dispersion of the fillers in the polymer matrix was confirmed by wide-angle X-ray scattering analysis (WAXS). In turn, the physicochemical properties were presented on the basis of the research results: thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). On the basis of the obtained results, it was found that both the amount and the type of fillers used significantly affected the functional properties of the tested composites.

Fibrillated nanocellulose (NCF) was isolated with high energy ultrasonication and dispersed via solution mixing in the polymer matrix. Composite filaments having a nanofiller concentration of 0.5wt%, 1wt% and 3wt% were then extruded, characterized and used in fused deposition modeling (FDM). Neat PHBH powder was then manually added to prepare a solid mixture at different fibrillated nanocellulose concentrations (from 0.5 to 3 wt%), to be then used to feed an extruder. SEM observations on filaments and 3D printed samples evidenced the good dispersion of fibrillated nanocellulose inside the matrix with the presence of agglomerates at higher NCF contents. The beneficial effects of the fibrillated nanocellulose in terms of stress at break and of elongation at break showed a maximum at a fibrillated nanocellulose content of 0.5 wt%. Moreover, the presence of fibrillated nanocellulose did not affect the thermal degradation behaviour of the materials, and also the glass transition and the melting temperatures were not influenced by NCF addition.

Investigations on the melt flow behaviour of aluminium filled ABS polymer composite for the extrusion-based additive manufacturing process	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIALS & PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						3D printing; additive manufacturing; pellet; screw extrusion; fused deposition modelling; FDM; acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; ABS; aluminium; polymer composite; melt flow rate; MFR	MECHANICAL-BEHAVIOR; PARAMETERS; PARTS; FDM	In extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) process, the melt flow rate (MFR) of material plays a significant role in determining the suitable process parameters for printing parts. MFR of the polymers varies on the addition of fillers which eventually leads to alteration in the pre-set values of process parameters. The present study deals with the evaluation of MFR of aluminium (Al) filled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) polymer matrix composite using melt flow index tester for extrusion-based AM process. L16 Taguchi OA method was used to design the experiments considering three factors and four levels. Extrusion temperature, extrusion load and filler loading (wt.% of Al) were considered as the input factors, while MFR was selected as the measured response. Furthermore, the significance of each factor was determined using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and signal-to-noise (SN) ratio techniques. Experimental results indicated the improvement in the MFR for 10 wt.% Al filled ABS composite. However, the opposite trend in MFR was observed for other combinations of ABS/Al. Based on obtained MFR results, process parameters were established to print parts of developed ABS/Al composite through a customised extrusion-based AM process. The present study may be useful in the fabrication of customised lightweight conductive structures.

In this regard, some methods for manufacturing and important and applied results are briefly introduced and presented. AM of polymeric matrix composites and nanocomposites has attracted great attention and is emerging as it can make extensively customized parts with appreciably modified and improved mechanical properties compared to the unreinforced polymer materials. However, some matters must be addressed containing reduced bonding of reinforcement and matrix, the slip between reinforcement and matrix, lower creep strength, void configurations, high-speed crack propagation, obstruction because of filler inclusion, enhanced curing time, simulation and modeling, and the cost of manufacturing. In this review, some selected and significant results regarding AM or three-dimensional (3D) printing of polymeric matrix composites and nanocomposites are summarized and discuss. In addition, this article discusses the difficulties in preparing composite feedstock filaments and printing issues with nanocomposites and short and continuous fiber composites. It is discussed how to print various thermoplastic composites ranging from amorphous to crystalline polymers. In addition, the analytical and numerical models used for simulating AM, including the Fused deposition modeling (FDM) printing process and estimating the mechanical properties of printed parts, are explained in detail. Particle, fiber, and nanomaterial-reinforced polymer composites are highlighted for their performance. Finally, key limitations are identified in order to stimulate further 3D printing research in the future.

Most commercially available vinyl ester and epoxy-amine resins are typically cured into polymeric materials via traditional manufacturing techniques, such as resin transfer molding and thermal curing. However, additive manufacturing (AM) has gained significant traction as a favorable manufacturing technique over traditional methods due to the ability to create customizable parts with complex geometries on-demand. Manipulation of polymer network connectivity using a dual-cure mechanism of methacrylate free radical cure via stereolithography (SLA) and epoxy-amine thermal cure for thein situcreation of interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) for AM was investigated. Resins and formulations of individual monomers bearing both vinyl ester and epoxy functionality were either synthesized or formulated to elucidate the effect of interconnecting the two networks at the molecular level. The formation of a multi-mechanistic, interconnected, sequentially cured IPN via SLA yielded polymeric materials with glass transition temperatures that exceeded 120 degrees C. Polymer network connectivity was shown to have a minimal impact on thermomechanical and thermogravimetric properties. IPN formation was shown to afford materials with high storage moduli (E ' values as high as 3.2 GPa), tensile strengths (as high as 51 MPa), Young's moduli (exceeding 3.5 GPa) and fracture energies (as high as 790 J m(-2)).

Optimisation procedure for additive manufacturing processes based on mask image projection to improve Z accuracy and resolution	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Mask image projection; Manufacturing optimisation	PROCESS PLANNING METHOD; FILE; STL	Mask image projection is an additive manufacturing (AM) technique used in photocurable materials which allows the simultaneous energy delivery in a whole area instead of a single spot. A common problem for this AM process is the uncontrolled penetration of light energy, which could cause a solidification of non-desired layers. In this paper, an optimization procedure is developed and presented in order to increase Z accuracy and resolution of printed parts through the control of the total accumulated dose and the photocuring conversion ratio of each spatial location of the manufacturing volume. Consequently, the uncontrolled monomer-to-polymer conversion of down-facing surfaces could be reduced. A finite element strategy is used in the optimisation procedure to obtain a full discretization of the whole manufacturing domain. Furthermore, experimental tests have been done to compare experimental results and numerical estimations. The results show that the use of the optimisation procedure increases the accuracy and resolution of printed parts along the manufacturing direction. (C) 2018 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

J	Gaynor, AT; Guest, JK				Gaynor, Andrew T.; Guest, James K.			Topology optimization considering overhang constraints: Eliminating sacrificial support material in additive manufacturing through design	STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; 3D printing; Projection methods; Anchors; Design for additive manufacturing; Self-supporting; Overhang features	MINIMUM LENGTH SCALE; PROJECTION; LAYOUTS; FILTERS; SCHEME	Additively manufactured components often require temporary support material to prevent the component from collapsing or warping during fabrication. Whether these support materials are removed chemically as in the case of many polymer additive manufacturing processes, or mechanically as in the case of (for example) Direct Metal Laser Sintering, the use of sacrificial material increases total material usage, build time, and time required in post-fabrication treatments. The goal of this work is to embed a minimum allowable self-supporting angle within the topology optimization framework such that designed components and structures may be manufactured without the use of support material. This is achieved through a series of projection operations that combine a local projection to enforce minimum length scale requirements and a support region projection to ensure a feature is adequately supported from below. The magnitude of the self-supporting angle is process dependent and is thus an input variable provided by the manufacturing or design engineer. The algorithm is demonstrated on standard minimum compliance topology optimization problems and solutions are shown to satisfy minimum length scale, overhang angle, and volume constraints, and are shown to be dependent on the allowable magnitudes of these constraints.

Bead parameterization of desktop and room-scale material extrusion additive manufacturing: How print speed and thermal properties affect heat transfer	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						material extrusion; fused filament fabrication; big area additive manufacturing; finite element analysis; heat transfer	FUSED FILAMENT FABRICATION; CARBON-FIBER; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; DIMENSIONAL ACCURACY; STRENGTH; POLYMERS; COMPOSITES; RELAXATION; SIMULATION; PREDICTION	Material extrusion (MatEx) additive manufacturing ranges in size from the desktop scale fused filament fabrication (FFF) to the room scale big area additive manufacturing (BAAM). The principles of how FFF and BAAM operate are similar - polymer feedstocks are heated until molten and then extruded to form three-dimensional parts through layer-by-layer additive manufacturing. However, the scales of FFF and BAAM differ substantially, which leads to critical differences in thermal behavior for these thermally-driven processes. This study compares heat transfer in FFF and BAAM using finite element thermal modeling. Parameterization is performed across material properties, layer number, and print speed at the desktop and room scale for MatEx. BAAM stays hotter than FFF for a longer period of time, which facilitates interlayer diffusion and weld formation, but can also lead to slumping or sagging. Changes in thermal diffusivity affect FFF more than BAAM, with FFF exhibiting a local maximum in weld time at the thermal diffusivity of ABS. In all cases, weld time is longer than relaxation time, indicating that polymer reorientation and interdiffusion is possible. For BAAM, the temperature and thermal history of the center of an extruded bead differs greatly from the surface of the bead, which has important implications for process monitoring, property prediction, and part performance.

Its significant contributions in the field of tissue engineering (TE) have significantly increased in the recent years. TE is used to regenerate or repair impaired tissues which are caused by trauma, disease and injury in human body. There are a number of novel materials such as polymers, ceramics and composites, which possess immense potential for production of scaffolds. However, the major challenge is in developing those bioactive and patient-specific scaffolds, which have a required controlled design like pore architecture with good interconnectivity, optimized porosity and microstructure. Such design not only supports cell proliferation but also promotes good adhesion and differentiation. However, the traditional techniques fail to fulfill all the required specific properties in tissue scaffold. The purpose of this study is to report the review on AM techniques for the fabrication of TE scaffolds. Design/methodology/approach - The present review paper provides a detailed analysis of the widely used AM techniques to construct tissue scaffolds using stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS), fused deposition modeling (FDM), binder jetting (BJ) and advanced or hybrid additive manufacturing methods. Findings - Subsequently, this study also focuses on understanding the concepts of TE scaffolds and their characteristics, working principle of scaffolds fabrication process. Besides this, mechanical properties, characteristics of microstructure, in vitro and in vivo analysis of the fabricated scaffolds have also been discussed in detail. Originality/value - The review paper highlights the way forward in the area of additive manufacturing applications in TE field by following a systematic review methodology.

Screw Extrusion Additive Manufacturing of Carbon Fiber Reinforced PA6 Tools	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE			English	Article						large format additive manufacturing; layer adhesion; mechanical properties; polyamide 6; screw extrusion; tool 3D printing	TEMPERATURE; STRENGTH; PRESSURE; POLYMERS; BEHAVIOR; WEAR; BOND	The creation of tools by additive manufacturing is becoming increasingly convenient for CFRP one-off and small batch production. Screw extrusion additive manufacturing of thermoplastic polymers has boosted the development of large format manufacturing solutions. Interlayer adhesion and anisotropic properties of a 3D printed part are indisputably key aspects of tool manufacturing process. In this study, thermal and mechanical properties of large format 40% carbon fiber reinforced polyamide 6 3D printed tools were determined. Moreover, the influence on part performance of two main printing parameters, deposition temperature and extruding pressure, was analyzed with respect to polymer melt rheology. The printed material revealed a highly anisotropic thermal and mechanical behavior associated with the alignment of the high carbon fiber content. The optimal process window was identified in terms of substrate deposition temperature. Along the print direction, no major impact on tensile and flexural mechanical properties was detected, while the injection molding values were exceeded by approximately 10%. The layer adhesion was estimated by measuring the stress at break on transversely Z-oriented specimens. Higher deposition temperatures and pressures, combined with lower viscosity, promote wetting and bond formation between layers, ultimately leading to more consistent performances. The best results in the transverse direction were achieved between 140 and 160 degrees C, reaching roughly a fifth of the longitudinal values. A significant drop in performance was detected below 120 degrees C, which was identified as the minimum process temperature. A post-process annealing heat treatment was also investigated, no beneficial outcomes were reported.

This review on the role of polymeric materials in additive manufacturing of oral dosage forms, focuses on the interface between the polymer and key stages of the additive manufacturing process, which determine printability. By systematically clarifying and comparing polymer functional roles and properties for a variety of AM technologies, together with current and emerging techniques to characterize these properties, suggestions are provided to stimulate the use of readily available and sometimes underutilized pharmaceutical polymers in additive manufacturing. We point to emerging characterization techniques and digital tools, which can be harnessed to manage existing trade-offs between the role of polymers in printer compatibility versus product performance. In a rapidly evolving technological space, this serves to trigger the continued development of 3D printers to suit a broader variety of polymers for widespread applications of pharmaceutical additive manufacturing.

J	Neiva, E; Badia, S; Martín, AF; Chiumenti, M				Neiva, Eric; Badia, Santiago; Martin, Alberto F.; Chiumenti, Michele			A scalable parallel finite element framework for growing geometries. Application to metal additive manufacturing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						adaptive mesh refinement; additive manufacturing; domain decomposition; finite elements; parallel computing; powder-bed fusion	POWDER-BED FUSION; ADAPTIVE MESH REFINEMENT; EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION; THERMOMECHANICAL MODEL; DOMAIN DECOMPOSITION; RESIDUAL-STRESS; LASER; SIMULATION; TEMPERATURE; ALGORITHMS	This work introduces an innovative parallel fully-distributed finite element framework for growing geometries and its application to metal additive manufacturing. It is well known that virtual part design and qualification in additive manufacturing requires highly accurate multiscale and multiphysics analyses. Only high performance computing tools are able to handle such complexity in time frames compatible with time-to-market. However, efficiency, without loss of accuracy, has rarely held the centre stage in the numerical community. Here, in contrast, the framework is designed to adequately exploit the resources of high-end distributed-memory machines. It is grounded on three building blocks: (1) hierarchical adaptive mesh refinement with octree-based meshes; (2) a parallel strategy to model the growth of the geometry; and (3) state-of-the-art parallel iterative linear solvers. Computational experiments consider the heat transfer analysis at the part scale of the printing process by powder-bed technologies. After verification against a three-dimensional (3D) benchmark, a strong-scaling analysis assesses performance and identifies major sources of parallel overhead. A third numerical example examines the efficiency and robustness of (2) in a curved 3D shape. Unprecedented parallelism and scalability were achieved in this work. Hence, this framework contributes to take on higher complexity and/or accuracy, not only of part-scale simulations of metal or polymer additive manufacturing but also in welding, sedimentation, atherosclerosis, or any other physical problem where the physical domain of interest grows in time.

Photocurable resins were prepared using a combination of various oligomers and monomers, cured in a UV-curing system, and characterized in terms of mechanical and thermal properties. Photocurable resins for stereolithography were prepared using varying concentrations of photoinitiator and pigment, 3D printed and characterized in terms of processability as well as mechanical and thermal properties. Multi objective optimization was performed to obtain the compositions with the highest desirability. The proposed approach enables convenient tailoring properties of photocurable resins by varying just four basic components.

Additive manufacturing enables personalised porous high-density polyethylene surgical implant manufacturing with improved tissue and vascular ingrowth	APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; 3D printing; Surgical implant; Polyethylene; Plasma treatment		Porous high-density polyethylene (pHDPE) surgical implants have played a significant role in aesthetic, reconstructive and skeletal augmentation procedures for more than 30 years and have been the gold-standard synthetic implant used in more than 400,000 procedures worldwide. The effects of pHDPE implant properties such as porosity, geometry and surface chemistry are crucial considerations. Additive manufacturing and plasma surface treatment are promising approaches to induce rapid tissue integration and vascularisation, improve healing times and lead to more satisfactory patient outcomes. Here, a novel pHDPE scaffold architecture obtained by laser sintering was characterised to quantify porosity variations as a result of manufacturing, compared to scaffolds manufactured via traditional moulding, laser sintering, and the clinical gold-standard surgical implant, MEDPOR (R). Plasma surface treatment was also explored as a means of improving the hydrophilicity of the HDPE. An in vitro cell culture study examined the attachment of cells on treated and non-treated scaffolds. After 3 days, plasma-treated scaffolds exhibited a 1.6-fold increase in cell attachment compared to non-treated, hydrophobic samples. Plasmatreated and non-treated samples were then implanted subcutaneously in rats for 1, 4, and 8 weeks to assess biocompatibility, tissue ingrowth and vascularisation. Histological analysis revealed that laser sintered StarPore (R) scaffolds exhibited significantly higher tissue ingrowth compared to the moulded scaffolds, whilst fibrous encapsulation dominated the tissue response in moulded StarPore (R) scaffolds. Plasma treatment did not significantly affect the quantity of tissue ingrowth, however it significantly increased the density of blood vessels within sintered StarPore (R) scaffolds by an average of 86.6%. Overall, this study demonstrated that novel manufacturing and plasma treatment of pHDPE surgical implants enhanced cell attachment in vitro and increased blood vessel density in laser sintered StarPore (R) scaffolds in vivo.

J	Al Rashid, A; Koç, M				Al Rashid, Ans; Koc, Muammer			Additive manufacturing for sustainability and circular economy: needs, challenges, and opportunities for 3D printing of recycled polymeric waste	MATERIALS TODAY SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Polymer waste; Additive manufacturing; Sustainability; Circular economy; Recycling; Upcycling	TECHNOLOGIES; PERFORMANCE	Polymer-based product usage rapidly increases globally, leading to severe ecological, social, environmental, health, and economic impacts. There has been an international push for solutions to sustainable production, consumption, and end-of-life for plastics to combat these issues. Moreover, additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing (3DP) processes provide rapid fabrication of functional parts in lesser time, lower lead times, and lower research and development costs. Due to these reasons, these processes are now being utilized in different industrial sectors, including aerospace, automotive, biomedical, sports, food, electronics, and construction. The circular economy concept integrated with AM processes can deliver a synergic impact and a new life to discarded polymeric parts with distributed recycling and manufacturing. With the development and adoption of the proper techniques, AM can be used widely to reuse polymer wastes to turn them into valuable products. It can lead to much higher levels of reuse at very low cost and for targeted applications. Therefore, in this study, a comprehensive literature review is performed to outline guidelines and a circular economy model for AM of recycled polymers based on the reviewed literature. This study delivers insight into; different commodity polymers and their uses, challenges in polymer recycling, polymer recycling approaches, and a circular economy model for AM of recycled polymers.

Novel AM systems and techniques are continuously being developed, leading to the application of AM polymers with textiles and fabrics in the fashion industry. This work investigates the development and testing of polymer-textile composites using polylactic acid (PLA) filaments on synthetic mesh fabrics using direct material extrusion (ME). An aspect of this paper highlights the appropriate combination of printing material, textile substrate, and printer settings to achieve excellent polymer-textile adhesion. Details of the printing process to create polymer-textile composites are described, as are the interfacial strength results of the T-peel tests, and the observed failure modes post-testing. The peel strengths for different ME bonded polymer-textile composites are examined and used to identify the compatibility of materials. This work visualised the potential of direct ME of polymers onto textile fabrics as a material-joining approach for new textile functionalisation, multi-material composite explorations and innovative aesthetic print techniques. This work also adds to the limited knowledge of AM polymer-textile composites, which can provide helpful information for designers and researchers to develop new applications and facilitate future research development in smart embedded and programmable textiles.

One of the reasons for this might be scepticism of engineers due to the lack of knowledge regarding the expected lifetime and reliability of these components under stress. Therefore, it is necessary to find fast, easy and reliable ways to determine the expected lifetime of a component without the need to apply expensive full-scale component testing for every new part. To realise this, finite element analysis combined with fracture mechanical lifetime calculations can be applied. In this paper, crack growth kinetics of the commonly used material poly(lactic acid) have been utilised to estimate the lifetime of a component under complex loading conditions, namely fatigue and friction. The calculated lifetime, based on a damage tolerant fracture mechanics approach, was found to be in good agreement to the results of full-scale component tests, proving the applicability of the chosen approach. Applying this knowledge can vastly decrease the necessary time during component design and encourage the additive manufacturing community towards applying their components also in structurally loaded applications.

J	Mieloszyk, M; Majewska, K; Andrearczyk, A				Mieloszyk, Magdalena; Majewska, Katarzyna; Andrearczyk, Artur			Embedded Optical Fibre with Fibre Bragg Grating Influence on Additive Manufactured Polymeric Structure Durability	MATERIALS			English	Article						additive manufacturing; polymer; fibre Bragg grating sensor; tensile strength	PRESSURE SENSOR; TEMPERATURE; DESIGN; STRAIN	Additive manufacturing (AM) polymers are applied in many branches of the industry due to the possibility of fast and accurate production of elements with various and complex shapes. Fibre Bragg grating sensors (FBG) are widely applied in structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. The main objective of this research is to perform analyses of the influence of embedded FBG sensors on AM polymer elements' durability. Two polymers (M3 X and M3 Crystal) with different mechanical properties were analysed. The tests were performed on samples with FBG sensors embedded in (different alignment) and attached to the surfaces of the elements. Firstly, the samples were exposed to elevated or sub-zero temperatures under stable relative humidity levels. The strain in the samples was measured using fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. The achieved results allow us to determine the relationships between strain and temperature for both materials and the differences in their mechanical response to the thermal loading. Then, the samples were subjected to a tensile test. A comparison of the tensile strength values was performed for the samples without and with embedded FBG sensors. The samples after the tensile tests were compared, showing differences in the mechanisms of failures related to the polymers and the thermal treatment influence on the material internal structure. Additionally, strain values measured by the FBG sensors were compared to the strain values achieved from the testing machine showing a good agreement (especially for M3 X) and indicating the differences in the materials' mechanical properties. The achieved results allow us to conclude there is a lack of influence of embedded FBG sensors on the mechanical durability of AM polymers.

Compared to other metal-based AM processes such as the powder bed fusion of metals (PBF-LB/M) or directed energy deposition (DED) processes such as laser metal deposition (DED-LB), CS features lower part resolution. One solution to increase the achievable level of detail is spraying onto removable molds. No study exists that investigates the general feasibility and manufacturing boundaries, from which design guidelines could be derived. In this paper, the applicability of material extruded and thermally bonded polymer (MEX-TRB/P) shapes, which is especially suitable for flexible low-cost production of small batches, as molds for cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM) is investigated. For this purpose, material extruded thermoplastics are examined regarding their suitability for the CS process.

Parts to be additive manufactured of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS Terluran GP 35) with mechanical properties close to the data sheet specification of injection molded parts are in the focus of this study. An in-house process chain from the plastic pellets to the finished additive manufactured product is developed to monitor and to define the process parameters for each individual processing step using the terpolymer. By varying the parameters extrusion nozzle diameter and layer height, the production-related internal part structure and the surface topography of the additive manufactured tensile test specimens are improved in such a way that the mechanical property yield strength rises from 55% to 75% of the data sheet specification for injection molded ABS parts. The elongation at break increases from 42% up to 70% of the specified data. The smallest extrusion nozzle diameter in connection with the smallest layer height provide the densest internal part structure, the lowest surface roughness and the best mechanical properties. Especially the ductility was controlled by the manufacturing parameters since the number of pores introduced in the internal part structure determine the number of crazes. Apart from ductility, even with low layer height but larger extrusion nozzle diameter, the resistance to failure of the material extrusion manufactured parts improves significantly and saves manufacturing time by a factor of 10.

J	Faludi, J; Bayley, C; Bhogal, S; Iribarne, M				Faludi, Jeremy; Bayley, Cindy; Bhogal, Suraj; Iribarne, Myles			Comparing environmental impacts of additive manufacturing vs traditional machining via life-cycle assessment	RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL			English	Article						Sustainability; 3D printing; LCA; Additive manufacturing; Environmental impact; Machining	ENERGY-CONSUMPTION	Purpose - The purpose of this study is to compare the environmental impacts of two additive manufacturing machines to a traditional computer numerical control (CNC) milling machine to determine which method is the most sustainable. Design/methodology/approach - A life-cycle assessment (LCA) was performed, comparing a Haas VF0 CNC mill to two methods of additive manufacturing: a Dimension 1200BST FDM and an Objet Connex 350 "inkjet"/"polyjet". The LCA's functional unit was the manufacturing of two specific parts in acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic or similar polymer, as required by the machines. The scope was cradle to grave, including embodied impacts, transportation, energy used during manufacturing, energy used while idling and in standby, material used in final parts, waste material generated, cutting fluid for CNC, and disposal. Several scenarios were considered, all scored using the ReCiPe Endpoint H and IMPACT 2002+ methodologies. Findings - Results showed that the sustainability of additive manufacturing vs CNC machining depends primarily on the per cent utilization of each machine. Higher utilization both reduces idling energy use and amortizes the embodied impacts of each machine. For both three-dimensional (3D) printers, electricity use is always the dominant impact, but for CNC at maximum utilization, material waste became dominant, and cutting fluid was roughly on par with electricity use. At both high and low utilization, the fused deposition modeling (FDM) machine had the lowest ecological impacts per part. The inkjet machine sometimes performed better and sometimes worse than CNC, depending on idle time/energy and on process parameters. Research limitations/implications - The study only compared additive manufacturing in plastic, and did not include other additive manufacturing technologies, such as selective laser sintering or stereolithography. It also does not include post-processing that might bring the surface finish of FDM parts up to the quality of inkjet or CNC parts. Practical implications - Designers and engineers seeking to minimize the environmental impacts of their prototypes should share high-utilization machines, and are advised to use FDM machines over CNC mills or polyjet machines if they provide sufficient quality of surface finish. Originality/value - This is the first paper quantitatively comparing the environmental impacts of additive manufacturing with traditional machining. It also provides a more comprehensive measurement of environmental impacts than most studies of either milling or additive manufacturing alone it includes not merely CO2 emissions or waste but also acidification, eutrophication, human toxicity, ecotoxicity and other impact categories. Designers, engineers and job shop managers may use the results to guide sourcing or purchasing decisions related to rapid prototyping.

Print fidelity metrics for additive manufacturing of cement-based materials	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; 3D printing; Fidelity; Quantitative; Metrics; Moment of inertia; Flaws; Cement; X-ray CT; Imaging	DIMENSIONAL ACCURACY; POINT CLOUDS; 3D; HYDROGELS	Additively manufactured cement-based structures for infrastructure applications suffer from in-construction shape deformations, which are a strong function of process conditions and the rheology of the printing material (cement paste, mortar, or concrete). Thus, characterization of the shape of such manufactured objects is critical to establish and ensure fidelity to the original CAD model. In this study, a number of quantitative metrics were used to compare the dimensional and shape accuracy of laboratory-scale printed cement-based objects. A new method is described that uses the axes of minimum moment of inertia and the centroid as the basis for aligning and comparing objects. X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data was used to characterize both internal and external features. Details of the logic and image processing requirements are given and typical sample irregularities that lead to quantification of uncertainty are illustrated. The effect of sampling statistics on metric confidence was studied and guidelines are provided for good sampling protocols. The results show the extent to which different penalty logics provide sensitivity for the detection of specific types of flaws. Furthermore, when the minimum moment of inertia is used as the basis for alignment and comparison, a high correlation is found between boundary-based and volume-based fidelity metrics. Such quantitative printability metrics are necessary to establish a basis for evaluating the repeatable shape fidelity of 3D-printed objects and for quantitatively studying how rheology affects both the manufacturing process and the final built part. The method is illustrated for benchmark printed objects fabricated using three hydrogel forming polymers as printing aids.

J	Oropeza, D; Roberts, R; Hart, AJ				Oropeza, Daniel; Roberts, Ricardo; Hart, A. John			A rapid development workflow for binder inks for additive manufacturing with application to polymer and reactive binder ink formulation	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES			English	Article						Binder jet additive manufacturing; Ink development; Green strength; Ink jetting; Reactive binders	DYNAMIC SURFACE-TENSION; WETTABILITY; ANISOTROPY; POWDERS; WATER	Binder jet additive manufacturing (BJAM) enables processing of metals, ceramics, polymers and composites through the deposition of a binding agent onto a powder bed in a layer-by-layer sequence. Most commonly, a polymer binder is utilized to provide temporary strength to the printed component enabling part removal and handling from the printer; however, it is challenging to manage distortion and shrinkage during sintering. Reactive binders, which create solid interparticle bridges upon decomposition, provide additional benefit beyond temporary green strength and can lead to enhanced densification kinetics, control of warping and shrinkage, and tailoring of local composition. This paper presents a process for the development of custom binder inks which includes exploration of binder ink rheology, wetting and infiltration interactions between the binder ink and powder, ink jetting and the effect of drop spacing on line formation, thermal decomposition of the binder, and evaluation of green strength using indentation. The binder ink development process is applied to the synthesis of custom polymer and reactive (metal salt) binder inks, showcasing the capability to control jetting behavior through rheological modifications and the favorable comparability of wetting, infiltration, and green strength of the reactive binders to the studied polymer binders. The viscosity and surface tension of the binder inks vary by 10 cP and 35 mN/m, respectively, with successful jetting and powder binding achieved by polymer and metal salt binder inks, with green strengths measured between 2 and 18 MPa. Through our presented process, rapid sampling of binders can be performed and through the implementation of reactive binders into BJAM in the future, a powerful tool for control of densification and warping is identified.

AM offers unprecedented opportunities for the development of ceramic-based electronics with complex 3D structures, which can be imparted with electronic functionalities. In this study, inductive force sensors composed of a ceramic-based magnetic core and polymer-based helical spring were fabricated using various AM technologies. To ensure reasonable force-sensing performance, the response to the external force was controlled by controlling the spring constant of the helical spring and measured according to the change in inductance of the magnetic sensing circuit implemented in the sensor. The fully additive manu-factured (AMed) inductive force sensors exhibited outstanding sensing performance: they achieved a sensitivity of 0.139 mu H/N with good repeatability, high linearity (99.01%), negligible hysteresis (less than 0.01 mu H), and robust cyclic endurance. The sensor performance was further validated by building and testing a robotic gripper that employed an AMed inductive force sensor. This study offers an innovative way to manufacture a variety of sensors with complex shapes that can fit into dummy spaces allowed by the design of electronic devices, which will contribute to the effective integration of various electronic components in future electronic systems, such as robots.

CFRP have superior physical and mechanical properties such as lightweight, high resilience, high-durability and high strength-to-weight ratio. CFRP composites stacked up with titanium to form multi-layered material stacks to enhance its load bearing capability. Traditional methods of stacking up CFRP and titanium involves using either high strength adhesives or rivets and bolts. The laminate structures joined by these methods often tend to fail during high load-bearing applications. Conventional metal welding technologies use high heat causing high thermal stresses and microstructural damages. Ultrasonic welding is a solid-state joining process, which has the capability of welding dissimilar materials at relatively low temperatures using ultrasonic vibration. Ultrasonic additive manufacturing (UAM) process is an ideal method to weld CFRP and Titanium. During the ultrasonic welding process, two dissimilar materials under a continuous static load are subjected to transverse ultrasonic vibrations, which results in high stress and friction between the two surfaces. This research focuses on the study of ultrasonically welding CFRP and Titanium stacks using UAM process. The study involves experimentation performed on an in-house built UAM setup. Finite element analysis is performed to understand the distribution stresses and strains during the UAM process. In this study, CFRP and Titanium layers are successfully welded using UAM process without causing any melting or significant heating. The finite element analysis study revealed that during UAM process, CFRP/Titanium stacks are subject to repeated cyclic shear stress reversals resulting in a strong weld joint. The stress-strain diagram during the process showed a considerable increase in plastic strain during the UAM process. The outcomes of this study can be used to further the industrial applications of the ultrasonic additive process as well as other ultrasonic welding based processes involving dissimilar materials.

This study presents the first report of VAM-printed thiol-ene resins. With well-ordered molecular networks, thiol-ene chemistry accesses polymer materials with a wide range of mechanical properties, moving VAM beyond the limitations of commonly used acrylate formulations. Since free-radical thiol-ene polymerization is not inhibited by oxygen, the nonlinear threshold response required in VAM is introduced by incorporating 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) as a radical scavenger. Tuning of the reaction kinetics is accomplished by balancing inhibitor and initiator content. Coupling this with quantitative measurements of the absorbed volumetric optical dose allows control of polymer conversion and gelation during printing. Importantly, this work thereby establishes the first comprehensive framework for spatial-temporal control over volumetric energy distribution, demonstrating structures 3D printed in thiol-ene resin by means of tomographic volumetric VAM. Mechanical characterization of this thiol-ene system, with varied ratios of isocyanurate and triethylene glycol monomers, reveals highly tunable mechanical response far more versatile than identical acrylate-based resins. This broadens the range of materials and properties available for VAM, taking another step toward high-performance printed polymers.

This study aims to investigate the potential of manufacturing polymer concrete in ambient room temperature of 30 +/- 2 degrees C. A laboratory test was conducted with the introduction of polyester retarder additive into polyester resin formulation. All tests were carried out strictly in ambient room temperature (30 +/- 2 degrees C). For comparison purpose, polyester resin without retarder additive was prepared as the control formulation under identical condition. Visual inspection was done on the fresh working life of polyester resin with 0%, 0.1%, 0.15%, and 0.2% of retarder additive in two different types of polyester resin-isophthalic and orthophthalic. Characterization on retarder additive was conducted under X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and, H-1 and C-13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Investigation on the effects of polymer retarder additive on the physical and mechanical properties of polymer resin, polymer blended, and polymer concrete showed that the retarder additive had prolonged the working life and improved properties of polymer concrete. These proved the potential of adding retarder additive in polymer concrete in ambient room temperature of 30 +/- 2 degrees C. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Advantages of polymeric additive manufacturing are to allow a re-design of components with integrated functions, to be cost-effective equipment for small batches production and the availability of suitable materials for many applications. The drawback is that for design validation extended testing is still necessary because of lacks in standardization and that the mechanical properties are building parameters dependent. The outcomes are a lower complexity of the design overall and lower number of components. These are pursued taking advantage of the anisotropy of the additive manufacturing processed polymer and assigning appropriate shapes and linkages in the mechanisms. Set of common materials (polylactide, polyethylene terephthalate, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) and technical (acrylonitrile styrene acrylate, polycarbonate/polybutylene terephthalate blend) are tested to obtain data for the modelling.

Bond interface design for single lap joints using polymeric additive manufacturing	COMPOSITE STRUCTURES			English	Article						Single lap joints; Adhesively bonded joints; Apparent shear strength; Polymer additive manufacturing; Finite element stress analysis	COMPOSITE JOINTS; ADHESIVE JOINTS; STRENGTH; FAILURE; REPAIRS; STRESSES	In this paper, the use of polymer additive manufacturing technology, also called 3D printing, for imparting texture to bond regions in adhesively bonded joints is explored. An improvement in the apparent shear strength values of adhesively bonded single lap joints is achieved by fusing structural reinforcements to the adherents through fused deposition modeling (FDM) additive technique. Towards that, computational models were first developed to simulate stress distribution along the overlap region of single lap shear joints, and four models that performed the best were chosen for physical testing. Pure adhesive (PA) joints were manufactured first, followed by the fabrication of 3D-printed adhesive (3D-PA) joints. Peak loads, shear stresses, and failure types were compared between these models. PA joints failed mainly adhesively, resulting in low peak loads and shear strength, whereas, 3D-PA joints registered higher average peak loads and shear strengths (increased by up to approximate to 832 %) with predominantly cohesive failure. 3D printed reinforcements appear to have imparted higher shear resistance against failure at the bond regions. Overall, using a combined computational and experimental approach, it is established that the 3D printed reinforcements have the potential to drastically improve the apparent shear strength of adhesively bonded single lap joints.

A commercial multi-extruder paste-extrusion 3D printer was used to process both metal and magnetic pastes into 3D structures. We formulated a low-temperature curable Poly-Mag paste, which is a mixture of magnetic powder and a polymer, as a feed material for printing the magnetic core and used a commercial nanosilver paste for printing the winding. After the structure was printed, it was cured at 250 degrees C for one hour without any external pressure to form the magnetic component. The nanosilver paste can achieve a crack-free single layer thicker than 100 mu m and the electrical resistivity of the printed winding was about three times higher than that of bulk silver. This is because of the low curing temperature resulted in a lower density than the bulk. The relative permeability dispersion of the 3D printed toroid core had a bandwidth up to 10 MHz with a static relative permeability of about 10. Both the winding and core magnetic properties will be improved by adjusting the feed paste formulations and their flow characteristics and fine-tuning the printer parameters, such as motor speeds, extrusion rate, and nozzle sizes.

Design/methodology/approach A series of plain and twill weave fabrics are designed using computer-aided design software Solidworks and printed using fused deposition modeling machines to determine the best model that could be printable. The structures were designed in such a way that the fabricated yarns with pure (PLA) were not sticking to each other in the fabric structure. The specimens were printed in vertical orientation and then tensile and three-point bending (flexural) tests were conducted for twill weave fabrics. Findings The tests showed that the mechanical strength was higher in the warp direction than in the weft direction. This difference was because of printing of continuous filament-like yarns in the warp direction and staple-like yarns in the weft direction. This orthotropic property of the material was verified by analyzing its microscopic structures via optical microscope. Research limitations/implications Future work should include improvement of the structure and exploration of different polymers and their composites to increase the tensile, bending and other strengths to make the 3D-printed structures more flexible and stronger. Future research should also focus on the large-scale manufacturing of 3D printed fabrics. Practical implications This paper supports work on wearable 3D-printed fabrics. The 3D-printed fabric will also contribute to new applications and products such as liquid filters. Originality/value The research done in this work is new and original. This paper contributes to new knowledge by providing a better understanding of polymers and their 3D printing capabilities to form a complex fabric structure.

Hybrid Manufacturing of Aluminium Parts Combining Additive and Conventional Technologies-Mechanical and Thermal Properties	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING AND MATERIALS PROCESSING			English	Article						hybrid manufacturing; additive manufacturing; powder bed fusion; AlSi10Mg; aluminium; mechanical properties; thermal properties	LASER MELTED ALSI10MG; FRACTURE-BEHAVIOR; ALLOY; MICROSTRUCTURE; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATION; POROSITY	Metal additive-manufacturing technologies enable the production of complex geometries. However, high manufacturing costs hinder these technologies being employed in some industries. In this sense, a hybrid strategy is presented in this paper, to achieve the best of additive and subtractive technologies, offering economic advantages. AlSi10Mg aluminium powder was deposited on AW-6082 pre-machined substrates and mechanical and thermal properties of these specimens were evaluated considering the application of a stress relief heat treatment. The results were especially good in the compressive mechanical properties and in the thermal properties: compressive properties were improved by up to 27%, and the specific heat capacity and coefficient of thermal expansion were reduced by up to 38%, compared to additively manufactured AlSi10Mg. Therefore, hybrid manufacturing can be a profitable solution (i) in thermal management applications, (ii) when compressive loads are presented, or (iii) to repair damaged parts, providing a circular economy, as presented in a case study of this paper.

Most PEEK substrates/components are manufactured using traditional methods like milling, compression molding, injection molding, pressure sintering, and so forth. With the advent of various additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, researchers have been working on optimizing the processing parameters for AM of PEEK. Furthermore, several PEEK composites with improved properties have also been developed, and efforts have also been made to use these PEEK composites in AM. Since AM of PEEK and its composites is a relatively new area of the advanced manufacturing process, the field faces many challenges. There is a dearth of comprehensive reports on this topic. Keeping this perspective in mind, we have tried to collate the relevant information on the composites and AM of PEEK in this review. The review highlighted the influence of variation in composition on material properties and performance of PEEK and showed the correlation with AM processability of such composites. A detailed analysis of the various reports on fused deposition modeling and selective laser sintering based processing of PEEK composites is included in the review. Critical barriers to the AM of these high-performance polymer composites are pointed out. We have also included the outcome of some interesting studies about the coating of PEEK with various materials/compounds to provide a broader perspective. This review will help the researcher to design and develop additively manufactured PEEK-based structures with improved and customized properties.

However, such technologies, with the exception of selective laser melting and sintering, are not used to fabricate metallic products because of the resulting poor life, short cycle, poor surface finish, and low structural integrity of the fabricated parts. The properties endowed by these parts do not match those of functional parts. Therefore, extensive research has been conducted to develop new additive manufacturing (AM) technologies by extending existing RP technologies. Several AM technologies have been developed for the fabrication of metallic objects. These technologies utilize materials, such as Ni-, Al-, and Ti-based alloys and stainless steel powders, to fabricate high-quality functional components. The present work reviews the type of materials used in laser-based AM processes for the manufacture of metallic products. The advantages and disadvantages of processes and different materials are summarized, and future research directions are discussed in the final section. This review can help experts select the ideal type of process or technology for the manufacturing of elements composed of a given alloy or material (Ni, Ti, Al, Pb, and stainless steel).

In the present work, we investigate the design and fabrication of an acoustic sandwich panel featuring wider soundabsorbing performance compared to the currently employed technologies (e.g., perforated honeycomb cell sandwich panels). The use of material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEAM) enables us to create panels in one manufacturing step with complex geometry. The developed multifunctional (i.e., mechanical and acoustic) sandwich panel, which is based on the combination of five Helmholtz resonators, demonstrates an absorption spectrum over 517 Hz when measured with an impedance tube. The developed acoustic design, named Trapezoidal Compact (TC) sandwich, has an acoustic spectrum with more than 90% of absorption, comprised between 643 Hz and 1160 Hz. Three-point bending tests revealed that the stiffness of the sandwich panels with the TC geometry is up to similar to 10% higher than those of the panels with a standard hexagonal honeycomb (HC) structure, additively manufactured with the same mass and wall thickness. The design developed in this work will contribute to the improvement of additive manufacturing process of multifunctional structures for aerospace applications.

This technology is popular due to its affordability, simple design, and compact size. In FFF technology, a wire form polymer material called filament is pushed inside a heated chamber using an extruder motor and teethed wheel. In a heated chamber, this filament is converted into semi-solid form and extruded out of the nozzle to fabricate the part. Producing the wire from raw polymer increases the cost as well as limits the used material up to such polymers, which could form a thin and long, continuous, and uniform wire with certain rigidity and other mechanical properties. Hence, the use of filament increases the cost of FFF technology and available wire-based 3D printers are limited by their material availability in the form of wire. These limitations could be eliminated by using a screw-based extrusion mechanism, in which feed materials would be used in pellets or granules form. Since studies on the development of commercial 3D printers based on pellets/granules extrusion were usually neglected Hence, in this study initial efforts have been made to design and develop a pellets/granules-extruder, which does accept a wide range of materials that are generally available in the market for conventional manufacturing processes. Further, flexible materials and the material which can't be converted into filament could also be used as feed material in the form of pellets/granules by using the developed system to fabricate a part for different industrial applications.

After more research and development, AM has become capable of producing complex net shaped in materials which can be used in applicable parts. These materials include metals, ceramics, and composites. Polymers and metals are considered as commercially available materials for AM processes; however, ceramics and composites are still considered under research and development. In this study, a literature review on design for AM of composite materials and potential alloys is discussed. It is investigated that polymer matrix, ceramic matrix, metal matrix, and fiber reinforced are most common composites through AM. Furthermore, Functionally Graded Materials (FGM) is considered as an effective application of AM because AM offers the ability to control the composition and optimize the properties of the built part. An example of FGM through using AM technology is the missile nose cone which includes an ultra-high temperature ceramic graded to a refractory metal from outside to inside and it used for sustaining extreme external temperatures. During this work, different applications of AM on different classifications of composite materials are shown through studying of industrial objective, the importance of application, processing, results and future challenges.

The de-binding process inevitably results in severe gas expansion and residual chars, leading to structural defects, accumulated stress, and compromised material properties in the final parts. Here we report a binder-free additive manufacturing process named hydrothermal-assisted jet fusion (HJF) that utilizes a hydrothermal method to create geometrically and compositionally complex ceramics under mild temperatures. The HJF process employs a selectively deposited volatile dissolving ink, high pressure, and mild heat to strategically fuse a ceramic powder bed into complex geometries. Compared to traditional AM methods for ceramics, the HJF process eliminates the need for organic binders in green part fabrication and offers the potential to directly co-print ceramics with other dissimilar materials, such as polymers and metals, enabling the development of novel multi-functional ceramic composites.

Using fillers to tune material properties of an ion-containing semi-crystalline poly(ethylene glycol) for fused filament fabrication additive manufacturing	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; 3D printing; Material extrusion; Fused filament fabrication (FFF); Soluble polymers; Ionomers		The materials library for Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing processes has been primarily dominated by amorphous thermoplastic materials. Semi-crystalline polymers form tough plastics due to their strong intermolecular forces, which makes them well suited for applications requiring wear and chemical resistance, thermal stability, and structural loading. However, they are infrequently used in FFF because of large shrinkage that occurs due to recrystallization during cooling, which causes printed layers to warp. The authors have previously evaluated a semi-crystalline polymer series (sulfonated poly(ethylene glycol) (SPEG)) for FFF printability. The influence of divalent counter-ions in the SPEG series altered the material properties and crystallization to enable processing via FFF. The SPEG containing a calcium counterion resulted in the print quality due to the higher viscosity (10(5) Pa.s) allowing the material to hold shape in the melt and high-nucleation and small spherulite size mitigating the layer warping. However, the dialysis used for the ion exchange in the polymer synthesis procedure proved challenging for mass manufacturing scale-up. To circumvent this limitation, the authors explore the incorporation of ionically charged filler materials in the SPEG with a sodium counter-ion, poly(PEG8k-co-NaSIP), to achieve the desired properties for FFF processing. Both ionic (calcium chloride and calcium carbonate) and non-ionic (silica and starch) filler particles were added to poly(PEG8k-co-NaSIP) and the resulting material properties and effect on FFF printability were measured. The calcium chloride filler changed the viscosity, crystallinity, spherulite growth, and spherulite size which improved the processing via FFF without requiring an ion exchange. This technique may be applicable to other ionic polymers in order to alter their material properties to enable FFF printing.

All these technologies allow parts manufacturing by adding successive layers of material which can be liquid, powder or wire. In order to take advantages of the geometric freedom offered by AM, Topological Optimization (TO) is usually used. TO provides the optimal distribution of material for a given request. The main objective is weight reduction, without compromising the original resistance of an existing part produced by traditional processes. Taking advantage of the freedom allowed by the AM process and conciliating it with the CAE features, which allow to simulate the parts behavior when subjected to the expected loads, a new approach methodology was drawn in order to shorten the time needed to optimize parts design for AM. A case study was developed in order to validate the methodology established. The combination of AM and TO revealed promising results, attending to the component efficiency achieved.

The process involves the deposition of homogeneous powder layers and employs a laser source to selectively melt a powder bed according to a CAD model. Due to its layer-by-layer nature, voids and pores are inevitably introduced in the fabricated thermoplastic parts. Porosity represents one of the major limitations of this technology being one of the main causes of the variation of the mechanical properties. With the intention of providing support for reducing the porosity and thus increasing the quality and performance of the final product, in this paper, a brief review was carried out focusing on the SLS process parameters and their interaction with the porosity of the product. In addition, an in-depth look was given to the mechanisms of formation and consolidation of pores within parts made of polymeric material.

J	Thomas, DJ				Thomas, Daniel J.			Advanced 3D additive manufacturing techniques for revolutionizing the next-generation rocket engine nozzle fabrication	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						3D additive manufacturing; Rocket engine components; Design flexibility; Production efficiency; Space industry	TECHNOLOGY	The aim of this study was to evaluate the redesign and additive manufacturing of a rocket engine nozzle using Inconel 625 material. The redesigned engine took into consideration material shrinkage during the metal transfer process. The additive manufacturing process was carried out using the appropriate toolpaths to form a solid structure. Micrographs of the additively manufactured structure showed layer resolution and fine detail, as well as the presence of metallic particles within the polymer matrix. The final rocket engine nozzle produced was found to have the necessary mechanical and metallurgical properties required for practical use in future space vehicle operations. This was demonstrated by tensile tests carried out at various temperatures and 3D white light interferometry scans of the surface properties. The results of the study suggest that additive manufacturing and Inconel 625 material can be used to produce high-performance rocket engine nozzles that meet the requirements of the aerospace industry. This study provides valuable insights into the potential applications of additive manufacturing in the aerospace industry and may lead to the development of new, high-performance rocket engine nozzles.

Joining by forming of additive manufactured 'mortise-and-tenon' joints	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART B-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANUFACTURE			English	Article						Forming; additive manufacturing; lap joints; sheets; experimentation; finite element method		This article is aimed at extending the 'mortise-and-tenon' joining concept commonly utilized in corner or tee joints to lap joints in which one sheet is partially placed over another without any change in their shape. The approach makes use of wire arc additive manufacturing to fabricate the tenons and allows various shapes and thicknesses to be made from a wide range of metallic materials. Upset compression of the tenons is utilized to mechanically lock the two sheets being joined. Experimental and finite element simulation works performed with monolithic (aluminium-aluminium) and hybrid (aluminium-polymer) 'unit cells' consisting of a single lap joint are utilized to investigate the deformation mechanics and the feasibility of the new proposed joining process. Tensile-shear loading tests were carried out to determine the maximum force that the new proposed joints are capable to withstand without failure. Pull-out forces of approximately 8 and 6 kN for the monolithic and hybrid joints allow concluding on the potential of additive manufactured 'mortise-and-tenon' lap joints to connect sheets made from similar and dissimilar materials.

The role of polymer mechanochemistry in responsive materials and additive manufacturing	NATURE REVIEWS MATERIALS			English	Review							SINGLE-MOLECULE FORCE; CROSS-LINKING; COVALENT MECHANOCHEMISTRY; MECHANOPHORE ACTIVATION; STRESS; MECHANOCHROMISM; SPIROPYRAN; ELASTOMERS; REACTIVITY; MECHANICS	Polymer mechanochemistry converts mechanical forces in materials to chemical reactions through the response of functional groups known as mechanophores. This Review discusses the colorimetric, mechanical, chemical and electronic responses of mechanophores that may be useful in materials for strain sensing and strengthening, soft devices and additive manufacturing. The use of mechanical forces to chemically transform polymers dates back decades. In recent years, the use of mechanochemistry to direct constructive transformations in polymers has resulted in a range of engineered molecular responses that span optical, mechanical, electronic and thermal properties. The chemistry that has been developed is now well positioned for use in materials science, polymer physics, mechanics and additive manufacturing. Here, we review the historical backdrop of polymer mechanochemistry, give an overview of the existing toolbox of mechanophores and associated theoretical methods, and speculate as to emerging opportunities in materials science for which current capabilities are seemingly well suited. Non-linear mechanical responses and internal, amplifying stimulus-response feedback loops, including those enabled by, or coupled to, microstructured metamaterial architectures, are seen as particularly promising.

However, the ability to produce suitable fire-retarded materials via this process has never been studied extensively. This work focuses on understanding the relation between reaction to fire and numerous additive manufacturing parameters. The goal was to determine the impact of those parameters on standard fire tests such as flame propagation test (UL94V) and cone calorimetry. The results were compared with material samples formulated via usual processes. On one hand, flame propagation results are impacted by many additive manufacturing parameters, such as the design of the part and the material flow. On the other hand, cone calorimeter results are only influenced by parameters having an impact on the sample mass.

J	Chawla, K; Singh, R; Singh, J				Chawla, Kapil; Singh, Rupinder; Singh, Jaspreet			On recyclability of thermoplastic ABS polymer as fused filament for FDM technique of additive manufacturing	WORLD JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; Melt flow index; Fused deposition modeling; Twin-screw extruder	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; FIBER; PARTS	Purpose The thermoplastic polymers do not decompose easily due to the presence of long-chain stable polymeric structure, and thus, causes serious effects on the environment. Recycling of these polymer wastes becomes the only solution to minimize their adverse effects on the environment. The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of using recycled thermoplastic material as filament for fused deposition modeling technique. Design/methodology/approach In this study, the researchers fabricated fused filaments (in-house) for fused deposition modeling (FDM) technique of additive manufacturing from secondary recycled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) by using a twin-screw extruder. After measuring the melt flow index of the secondary recycled ABS, the twin-screw extrusion parameters (rpm/speed of the screw, extrusion temperature and load) were varied to predict their influence on the various properties (rheological/mechanical/thermal) of the fabricated filaments. Experimental work was executed as per Taguchi's L9 orthogonal array. Findings Thermal analysis performed to estimate the heat carrying capacity of recycled ABS highlighted that the heat capacity of ABS increases significantly from 0.28 J/g to 3.94 J/g during the heating cycle. The maximum value of peak strength and percentage break elongation for the fused filaments was investigated at 12.5 kg load, 2,250 C extrusion temperature and 70 rpm speed. Originality/value The filaments fabricated by recycling the polymeric waste has been successfully used in the FDM machine for the preparation of the three-dimensional printed tensile specimen.

These new technologies require the development of optimized materials with two-folded capabilities, able to satisfy functional in-service requirements but also showing a proper printability. Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate (ASA) is among the most interesting thermoplastic materials to be implemented in a LFAM device due to its excellent wettability and mechanical properties. This research focuses on the development and characterization of ASA and carbon fiber (CF) ASA composites suitable for LFAM. The rheological, thermal and mechanical properties of neat ASA and ASA containing 20 wt% CF are addressed. The results evidence the higher performance of the CF loaded composite compared to the raw ASA polymer (i.e., the 20 wt% CF composite shows a 350% increase in flexural Young's Modulus and a 500% increment in thermal conductivity compared with neat ASA). Additionally, both materials were successfully printed along perpendicular directions (X and Z), showing the maximum tensile strain for the composite printed along the X orientation as was expected. The results of the flexural tests are comparable or slightly higher than those of injected parts. Finally, the fracture surface was analysed, identifying different types of porosity.

J	Chang, GQ; Wang, YH; He, J; Xiong, Y				Chang, Guoquan; Wang, Yaohui; He, Jian; Xiong, Yi			A graph-based path planning method for additive manufacturing of continuous fiber-reinforced planar thin-walled cellular structures	RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL			English	Article						Cellular structure; Continuous fiber-reinforced polymer additive manufacturing (CFRP-AM); Path planning; Euler path	DESIGN; OPTIMIZATION; LAYOUT	Purpose Composite cellular structures have wide application in advanced engineering fields due to their high specific stiffness and strength. As an emerging technology, continuous fiber-reinforced polymer additive manufacturing provides a cost-effective solution for fabricating composite cellular structures with complex designs. However, the corresponding path planning methods are case-specific and have not considered any manufacturing constraints. This study aims to develop a generally applicable path planning method to fill the above research gap. Design/methodology/approach This study proposes a path planning method based on the graph theory, yielding an infill toolpath with a minimum fiber cutting frequency, printing time and total turning angle. More specifically, the cellular structure design is converted to a graph first. Then, the graph is modified to search an Eulerian path by adding an optimal set of extra edges determined through the integer linear programming method. Finally, the toolpath with minimum total turning angle is obtained with a constrained Euler path search algorithm. Findings The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through the fabrication of both periodic and nonperiodic composite cellular structures, i.e. triangular unit cell-based, Voronoi diagram-based and topology optimized structures. The proposed method provides the basis for manufacturing planar thin-walled cellular structures of continuous fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP). Moreover, the proposed method shows a notable improvement compared with the existing method. The fiber cutting frequency, printing time and total turning angle have been reduced up to 88.7%, 52.6% and 65.5%, respectively. Originality/value A generally applicable path planning method is developed to generate continuous toolpaths for fabricating cellular structures in CFRP-additive manufacturing, which is an emerging technology. More importantly, manufacturing constraints such as fiber cutting frequency, printing time and total turning angle of fibers are considered within the process planning for the first time.

A nonlinear three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) model was developed by implementing an apparent heat capacity model using the Heat Transfer Module in COMSOL (R) Multiphysics software. FE results in the standoff region were validated by experimental tests, concerning various nozzle sizes and extrusion speed. The validated numerical results demonstrated that there is a complex correlation between processing parameters and thermal behaviors such as phase change and temperature distribution in the standoff region. The FE results were then employed in training an artificial neural network (ANN). A well-established compromise between the trained ANN and the FE results demonstrates that the trained ANN can be employed in the prediction of further thermal and glass transition behavior using subsequent processing parameters.

Cork-polymer composites (CPC) were prepared using a Brabender type mixer incorporating 15% (w/w) of cork powder (corresponding to 55% (v/v)) and having polylactic acid (PLA) as matrix. In order to promote a chemical adhesion between cork particles and PLA, the effect of maleic anhydride grafted PLA (MAgPLA) was studied. Fourier Transform Infrared - Attenuated Total Reflection (FTIR-ATR) analysis was used to evaluate the functionalization of MAgPLA onto the polymeric chain. The addition of MAgPLA enhanced the mechanical behavior by increasing tensile properties while improving the dispersion of cork particles within PLA matrix. In addition, cork particles and MAgPLA acted as nucleating agents during PLA melting process. To evaluate the printability of the developed CPC filament, specimens were printed by Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) and compared to those obtained by injection molding (IM). FFF allowed to preserve the cork alveolar structure in the specimens, benefiting CPC mechanical behavior. 3D parts could be printed with the CPC filament thereby demonstrating the usefulness of the fully biodegradable cork-based filament here developed. 3D printed parts exhibit unique characteristics, such as a nonplastic and warm touch, a natural colour and the release of a pleasant odour during the printing process.

However, a major challenge to the controllable and seamless integration of biological systems and external electronics is the fundamental mismatch in physicochemical properties and weak signal transmission between the biotic-abiotic interfaces. Here, we demonstrated an innovative method to fabricate the conductive-polymer-bacteria living electrode with a rapid and controllable 3-D printing platform and simple electrochemical polymerization techniques. The monomer precursor 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) was printed into a 3-electrode electrochemical cell containing the exoelectrogen Shewanella oneidensis wild type MR-1. The monomer was in-situ electrochemically polymerized to the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), entrapping and connecting the electrochemically active bacteria to the electrode within 35 min. Using cyclic voltammetry (CV), the living electrode showed enhanced bio-electrochemical activities, providing transformative development for bioenergy harvesters, biosensors and biomedical devices.

J	Wang, WM; Xia, Y				Wang, Weiming; Xia, Yi			Topology optimization based channel design for powder-bed additive manufacturing	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Powder-based 3D printing; Channel design; Topology optimization; Topology extraction; Light-weight structure	CELLULAR STRUCTURES; MODELS	Additive manufacturing (AM) technology allows us to manufacture 3D models with arbitrarily complex shapes. Among different AM technologies, powder-based 3D printing techniques, such as laser-based powder bed fusion of metals and polymers (PBF-LB/M and PBF-LB/P), are common tools favored by engineers and have been widely used in the industrial field. In order to reduce the cost of printing materials, a large variety of lightweight infill structures have been proposed, such as skin-frame structures, lattice structures, honeycomb structures and porous structures. Currently, most of the proposed methods lead to a large number of closed voids in the printed models. These closed voids are particularly detrimental to structures printed using powder-based 3D printing techniques. A large amount of powder remains in the closed voids and cannot be discharged, which will reduce the performance of the printed structure. This problem limits the application of powder-based 3D printing techniques for printing complex structures. To the best of our knowledge, very few investigations have been conducted to address this problem. In this paper, a method based on topology optimization (TO) is proposed to automatically generate channels between closed voids and outlets, by which the remaining powder of the powder-based printing structures can be discharged. The proposed method consists of three main steps: 1) topology optimization, 2) topology extraction, 3) channel generation. Six standard structures with a large number of closed voids are investigated to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. In addition, experimental tests are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the generated channels.

Selective Laser Melting (SLM) consists of melting a previously formed powder layer by laser and fusing layers together according to the CAD-data. SLM is a promising method for producing custom-made implants from titanium powders due to the possibility of creating geometrically complex parts with high mechanical properties directly from the CAD-file. In the presented work, a hip implant was manufactured by SLM from plasma atomized Ti-6Al-4V powder. Computer-tomography data of the patient's deformed bone structure was used for 3D-printing the patient's hip bone model from polyamide. Then an implant prototype was made from polymer accounting the anatomical features of the patient. The implant model was 3D-scanned to obtain a CAD-file of the implants, which was further improved using CAD-software by partial texting of its surface. Titanium implant was produced by SLM and then annealed to achieve the better combination of tensile strength and elongation by partial decomposition of martensitic phase, which allowed the mechanical properties of the produced material meet the requirements of ASTM F2924 for additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V alloy and ISO 5832-3 Implants for surgery from titanium 6-aluminum 4-vanadium alloy. The hip implant has been successfully installed to the patient. The postoperative supervision has shown a good result. Applying AM for producing the custom hip implant allowed decrease the operation time and lessen the risk of the infection ingress.

Engineers and designers can go deeper into optimization and improvements of their designs without drawbacks of long manufacturing times. However, some drawbacks such as the limited available materials or uncertainty about mechanical properties and anisotropic behavior of 3D printed parts prevent use in large-scale production. To gain knowledge and confidence about printed materials it is necessary to know how they behave under different stress states and strain-rate regimes, and how some of the printing parameters may affect them. The present work proposes an experimental methodology framework to study and characterize materials printed by stereolithography (SLA) to clarify certain aspects that must be taken into account to broaden the use of this kind of material. To this end, tensile and compression tests at different strain rates were carried out. To study the influence of certain printing parameters on the printed material behavior, samples with different printing angles (theta = [0-90]) and different printing resolution (layer height of 50 and 100 mu m) were tested. In addition, the effects of curing time and temperature were also studied. The testing specimens were manufactured in the non-professional SLA machine Form 2 from Formlabs(R) using resin called Durable. Nevertheless, the proposed experimental methodology could be extended to any other resin.

The present study aims to synthesize and characterize micro lane-type surface patterns of PDMS polymers and evaluate their effects on mechanical properties for various applications in the bio-engineering field. Fabrication of surface patterns is achieved using fused filament fabrication in additive manufacturing, and the mechanical properties of the polymer specimens with the surface patterns are measured using tensile test. The surface patterns are rotated at different angles and changed into different shapes to change the anisotropic material properties of the PDMS specimens. This is achieved by changing the raster angles and modifying the fused filament paths during the additive manufacturing process. In addition, the application of the printed pattern to medical soft robot is presented. Owing to the anisotropic material properties, in-plane and out-of-plane actuation can be realized by attaching polymer patches with different lane-type surface patterns. The results of this study support the implementation of additive manufacturing for the rapid manufacture of scalable structures with anisotropic material properties for various applications.

For fabrication a special inert gas process chamber for laser powder bed fusion was used. Inspired by the nanocrystalline ribbon structures, well-known from melt-spinning, the concept was successfully transferred to the additive manufactured parts. For example, for Nd16.5-Pr1.5-Zr2.6-Ti2.5-Co2.2-Fe65.9-B8.8 (excess rare earth (RE) = Nd, Pr; the amount of additives was chosen following Magnequench (MQ) powder composition) a maximum coercivity of mu H-0(c) = 1.16 T, remanence J(r) = 0.58 T and maximum energy density of (BH)(max) = 62.3 kJ/m(3) have been achieved. The most important prerequisite to develop nanocrystalline printed parts with good magnetic properties is to enable rapid solidification during selective laser melting. This is made possible by a shallow melt pool during laser melting. Melt pool depths as low as 20 to 40 mu m have been achieved. The printed bulk nanocrystalline Fe-Nd-B based permanent magnets have the potential to realize magnets known so far as polymer bonded magnets without polymer.

However, there is a lack of related publications. The purpose of this study is to present experimental data regarding geometrical analysis, such as dimensional accuracy and surface roughness, tensile strength and elongation of parts manufactured with flame-retardant materials by additive manufacturing. Design/methodology/approach-Two additive manufacturing processes, selective laser sintering (SLS) and fused deposition modeling (FDM), were selected to manufacture the parts to be evaluated. Each process used its respective polymer, that is polyamide with flame-retardant additive (PA) for SLS and polyphenylsulfone (PPSF) for FDM. The samples consist of tensile specimens and representative parts of different products. Tensile tests were performed using standard tensile test machines, and geometrical analyses were performed using coordinate measuring machine as well as surface roughness tester. Findings-As each material can be, in commercial machines, produced by only one process, the material selection for final products has to consider the manufacturing process as well. In general, although the FDM/PPSF process provided specimens with the highest ultimate strength, because of its strong influence by the building direction, FDM/PPSF also provided the lowest strength. SLS/PA was able to provide average strength with less dependency on the build-up direction. The geometrical analysis showed that SLS/PA presents a much smoother surface, but FDM/PPSF presented slightly better dimensional accuracy. Originality/value-There is still lack of publications on polymers with flame resistance or flame-retardant polymers. Thus, this paper brings new technical information about processing such materials.

Nano additives also supply various advantages for polymers which can be employed in additive manufacturing methods. Among the additive manufacturing methods, stereolithography is one of the most remarkable to produce nano-modified polymers because of the easy nano modification of the photocurable resins. In the present study, we mixed the metal oxide particles; Fe2O3, ZnO, NiO, Al2O3, TiO2, and MgO with the photocurable epoxy and used the mixtures to print the specimens. We investigated the structural morphology, thermal and mechanical properties of the printed specimens with an optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimeter, differential thermogravimetric analysis, and microhardness, respectively. Findings proved the dilute agglomeration of the nano additives. Besides, nano additives can improve the thermal stability of the photo-cured polymer. The microhardness of the Fe2O3 added polymers reached 27.63 HV levels while it was measured as 16.16 HV for the pristine samples (similar to 70% raise was experienced). The maximum degradation temperatures of the polymer nanocomposite structures were measured in the range of 396-420 degrees C.

Compared to traditional laser welding, the DED process can produce a smaller penetration depth due to the ejection of feedstocks into the melt pool. Such an additive process also enables the multilayer deposition of three-dimensional (3D) Ti alloys with a designed structure to coalesce with the CFRP plate. This study utilized numerical modeling and experiments to uncover the interface formation mechanisms and bonding performance of CFRP/Ti stacks fabricated at different laser powers. The cross-sectional morphologies of CFRP/Ti stacks were observed by an optical microscope (OM) and a scan-ning electron microscope (SEM). Physical gaps and pores existed along CFRP/Ti interface and within CFRP substrates, respectively. The bonding performance of overall CFRP/Ti stacks was also assessed by lap shear tensile testing. The lap shear tensile strength increased first and then decreased with laser power. The fracture failure of CFRP/Ti interface was characterized by a SEM and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which indicated the mixed adhesion and cohesion failure mode of DED-joint stacks. This work provides a novel CFRP/Ti stack joining paradigm through DED, paving the way for AM of multi-material lightweight components.

J	Khan, SA; Lazoglu, I				Khan, Shaheryar A.; Lazoglu, Ismail			Development of additively manufacturable and electrically conductive graphite-polymer composites	PROGRESS IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Material extrusion; Direct ink writing; Electrically conductive polymer composite; Electrically conductive additive manufacturing	SODIUM CARBOXYMETHYL CELLULOSE; 3D; PARTS	The selectivity between electrically conductive and insulating regions within one additively manufactured part can open new domains for customized, smart, and active products. In this article, new electrically conductive polymer matrix composites (ePMC) were developed for additive manufacturing (AM) by loading an aqueous matrix of carboxymethyl cellulose with micro-sized graphite particles. Electrically conductive AM can be achieved using the developed ePMC with the direct ink writing (DIW) technique. The effects of graphite loading on the properties of ePMCs and their suitability for AM were investigated using various characterization techniques. The non-Newtonian shear-thinning behavior of the ePMC inks indicates the suitability of these inks for DIW. Tunable electrical conductivity in the range of 87-128 S m(-1) can be achieved with a 15% margin of error. DIW of scaffolds with rectilinear and honeycomb infill patterns demonstrate the additive manufacturability of the developed ePMCs. Furthermore, an application of additively manufactured and electrically conductive part as a heating element was demonstrated. The developed ePMCs can be employed in diverse applications such as AM of conductive tracks, resistors, and electrodes for capacitors and energy storage devices.

J	Xin, CX; Li, Z; Hao, L; Li, Y				Xin, Chenxing; Li, Zheng; Hao, Liang; Li, Yan			A comprehensive review on additive manufacturing of glass: Recent progress and future outlook	MATERIALS & DESIGN			English	Review						Additive manufacturing; Glass; Transparent component; Optical property; M-3 strategy	SILICA GLASS; DEPOSITION; CERAMICS; STEREOLITHOGRAPHY; LUMINESCENT; FABRICATION; QUARTZ; SIO2	As an advanced and revolutionary technology, additive manufacturing (AM) has received significant research attention in the field of materials processing. It is also gradually being applied to glass manufacturing owing to its significant advantages of being able to fabricate glass components with arbitrary and complex geometry. In addition, it ensures a high spatial resolution, low surface roughness (without polishing treatment), high optical transparency, and guarantees accuracy in terms of small-scale characteristics. Whilst the development of AM technology in glass manufacturing is relatively slower than in polymer, metal, and ceramics manufacturing, it has made considerable progress in the fabrication of functional glass devices, including gradient refractive index optics, microlenses, colour converters, microfluidics, and micro-toroid optical resonators. Great potential has been exhibited on multi-material, multi-scale, multi-functionality (M-3), and hybrid additive manufacturing, it will definitely be the future trend on transparent glass components fabrication. This review provides a systematic summary of different AM techniques, with an emphasis on the printing strategies, resolution, multi-material capability, and property evaluation of glass. In addition, the defect formation, feasible solutions, and potentially suitable applications are discussed. An in-depth analysis of the current limitations and perspectives on the future developments of each category of AM are also provided. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This process creates a structure by slicing a 3D model and stacking ceramic materials layer-by-layer without mold or machining. C-AM is a technology suitable for the era of multiple low-volume because it is more flexible than conventional methods for shape complexity and design modification. However, many barriers to practical use remain due to process speed, defects, and lack of knowledge. This review focuses on studies to overcome the limitations of C-AM in terms of process and materials. The C-AM process has been advanced through various studies such as model/equation-based parameter control and high-speed sintering using external energy. Besides, by improving and fusing existing technologies, high-precision high-speed printing technology has been improved. A variety of material studies have been made of manufacturing ceramic structures with superior properties using preceramic polymers and composite materials. Through these studies, C-AM has been applied to various fields such as medicine, energy, environment, machinery, and architecture. These continued growths and diverse results demonstrate the importance and potential of C-AM based ceramic manufacturing technology.

The density of the printed magnet is similar to 5.2 g/cm(3). The room temperature magnetic properties are: intrinsic coercivity H-ci = 8.9 kOe (708.2 kA/m), remanence B-r = 5.8 kG (0.58 T), and energy product (BH)max = 7.3 MGOe (58.1 kJ/m(3)). The as-printed magnets are then coated with two types of polymers, both of which improve the thermal stability as revealed by flux aging loss measurements. Tensile tests performed at 25 degrees C and 100 degrees C show that the ultimate tensile stress (UTS) increases with increasing loading fraction of the magnet powder, and decreases with increasing temperature. AC magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements show that the 3D printed Nd-Fe-B bonded magnets exhibit extremely low eddy current loss and high resistivity. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the 3D printed magnets in a DC motor configuration via back electromotive force measurements.

Additive manufacturing of polymer-derived ceramic matrix composites	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY			English	Article						composites; polymer precursor; printing; silicon oxycarbide	FRACTURE-TOUGHNESS; PYROLYSIS	This study presents a fabrication method and identifies processing bounds for additively manufacturing (AM) ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), comprising a silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) ceramic matrix. A digital light projection printer was used to photopolymerize a siloxane-based preceramic resin containing inert ceramic reinforcement. A subsequent pyrolysis converted the preceramic polymer to SiOC. Particle reinforcements of 0 to 40% by volume in the green state were uniformly dispersed in the printed samples to study their effects on pyrolysis mass loss and shrinkage, and CMC notch sensitivity and strength. Both particle and whisker reinforcements toughened the glassy SiOC matrix (1 MPa m(1/2)), reaching values >3 MPa m(1/2). Bending strengths of >300 MPa (>150 MPa (g cm(-3))(-1)) and a Weibull modulus of 10 were measured on AM samples without surface finish. We identified two pore formation mechanisms that placed processing bounds on sample size and reinforcement volume fraction. Methods for increasing these bounds are discussed. With properties commensurate to traditionally processed technical ceramics, the presented process allows for free-form fabrication of high-performance AM CMC components.

Consequently, it has potential to advance micro- to milllifluidic LOC design, prototyping, and production and further its application in areas of biomedical and biological research. However, its application in these areas has been hampered due to material biocompatibility concerns. In this review, we summarise commonly used AM techniques: vat polymerisation and material jetting. We discuss factors influencing material biocompatibility as well as methods to mitigate material toxicity and thus promote its application in these research fields.

Unlike conventional manufacturing techniques, additive manufacturing can fabricate customised interventions with relative ease. In drug delivery, other drivers for growth in the technology is the production of complex dosage forms, incorporating multiple drugs and materials, and the pursuit of on-demand manufacturing. For tissue engineering applications, additive manufacturing is creating 3D scaffolds to aid or replace the native tissue with morphology and internal architecture which mimic the final shape and structure of the defective tissue. The chapter details the utilisation of additive manufacturing in the production of pharmaceutical dosage forms, spanning simple flat-faced oral tablets to more complex drug--delivery systems that provide for the independent release of multiple drug compounds. For tissue engineering applications, the chapter describes the production of scaffolds for various soft tissue scaffolds currently under development by research teams worldwide.

Several research papers on carbon fiber reinforced composites, used carbon fiber tows directly or sized carbon fibers as reinforcement for the composite, which is time consuming and not reliable as frequent clogging occurs. This paper presents a simple method by introducing the novel use of twisted carbon fiber filament and analyze its effect on the additive manufactured composites. The matrix material used is PLA. The commercially available 3D printers for printing continuous fibers, use double nozzle setups for printing the matrix and reinforcement separately in a layer by layer manner. However, there are no reports on the use of twisted continuous carbon fiber as filament and its effect on the printed parts. This paper uses twisted carbon fibers with single nozzle setup such that the material coming out of the nozzle will be ready to use CCF-PLA composite. Thus, the need of separate stacking of each layer of the matrix and fiber can be avoided. A separate path process planning has been done for printing the twisted carbon fibers in consideration of its continuity and the anisotropy. Standard mechanical tests are conducted, and the morphological study of the composite is done. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Manufacturing process-driven structured materials (MPDSMs): design and fabrication for extrusion-based additive manufacturing	RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL			English	Article						Fused deposition modeling; Fused filament fabrication; Design for additive manufacturing; Structured materials	TOPOLOGY OPTIMIZATION; SOFT METAMATERIALS; FRACTURE-TOUGHNESS; RESIDUAL-STRESS; SHAPE; CONSTRAINTS; GRAMMARS; BEHAVIOR; DEFECTS; TEXTURE	Purpose This paper aims to explore the design and fabrication of meso-scale Manufacturing Process-Driven Structured Materials (MPDSMs). These are designed, architected materials where the prime design requirement is manufacturability. The concepts are applied to those fabricated using fused deposition modeling or fused filament fabrication (FDM/FFF), a thermoplastic polymer additive manufacturing (AM) process. Three case studies were presented to demonstrate the approach. Design/methodology/approach The paper consists of four main sections; the first developed the MPDSMs concept, the second explored manufacturability requirements for FDM/FFF in terms of MPDSMs, the third presented a practical application framework and the final sections provided some case studies and closing remarks. Findings The main contributions of this study were the definition and development of the MDPSMs concept, the application framework and the original case studies. While it is most practical to use a well-defined AM process to first explore the concepts, the MPDSMs approach is neither limited to AM nor thermoplastic polymer materials nor meso-scale material structures. Future research should focus on applications in other areas. Originality/value The MPDSMs approach as presented in this concept paper is a novel method for the design of structured materials where manufacturability is the prime requirement. It is distinct from classic design-for-manufacturability concepts in that the design space is limited to manufacturable design candidates before the other requirements are satisfied. This removes a significant amount of schedule and costs risk from the design process, as all the designs produced are manufacturable within the problem tolerance.

J	Nagarajan, HPN; Haapala, KR				Nagarajan, Hari P. N.; Haapala, Karl R.			Characterizing the influence of resource-energy-exergy factors on the environmental performance of additive manufacturing systems	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Environmental performance; Exergy analysis; Life cycle assessment; Energy efficiency	LIFE-CYCLE ANALYSIS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; DECOMPOSITION; INTENSITY; TRENDS	Additive manufacturing is rapidly emerging as an alternative to conventional manufacturing, including subtractive processes, often attributed to its claim for sustainable product development, e.g., reduced cost, reduced energy and material use, and the distributed production of tailored consumer products. However, many of these benefits remain unsubstantiated for large-scale production. The aim of the research herein is to identify and characterize the factors influencing the systemic environmental performance of additive manufacturing as an end use of energy, using exergy analysis and life cycle assessment. These methods have been previously applied to evaluate the environmental performance of conventional and non-conventional manufacturing processes, and offer a validated approach to explore the environmental impacts of additive manufacturing with respect to systemic material and energy losses. In this study, the environmental impacts of direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) of iron metal powder and fused deposition modeling (FDM) of acrylonitrile styrene acrylate polymer filament are characterized by performing a thermodynamic (exergy) analysis of the resources and energy utilized and lost from cradle to gate. It is found that only 10% of total DMLS process inputs contribute to material processing, while 90% of the inputs are lost as bulk waste, heat, and work. For FDM, it is found that only 7% of total process inputs contribute to material processing, while 93% are lost. Following the exergy analysis, life cycle assessment is performed to characterize the environmental impacts of the exergy losses using single-issue indicator (Global Warming Potential, GWP) and aggregate indicator (ReCiPe 2008) methods. The results show that electricity consumption is a key contributor to both focal processes and their related upstream processes. The systemic GWP for DMLS is 69 kg CO2 equivalent, while for FDM it is 89 kg CO2 equivalent, per kilogram of material processed. Using the ReCiPe 2008 method, damage to human health is predicted to outweigh damage to ecosystem quality and resource availability for the DMLS process. For the FDM process, damage to human health and resource availability are predicted to outweigh damage to ecosystems quality. This work concludes that electrical energy use is the key contributor to systemic environmental impacts of additive manufacturing. Thus, it is imperative that we identify solutions to generate clean electrical energy, reduce electricity transmission losses, reduce material processing energy use, and design products that enable efficient additive manufacturing.

J	Mondal, K; Tripathy, PK				Mondal, Kunal; Tripathy, Prabhat Kumar			Preparation of Smart Materials by Additive Manufacturing Technologies: A Review	MATERIALS			English	Review						additive manufacturing; advanced printing; 3D printing; 4D printing; smart materials	STRAIN SENSORS; SILVER-ZINC; 3D; POLYMERS; FABRICATION; DEPOSITION; COMPLEX; DESIGN	Over the last few decades, advanced manufacturing and additive printing technologies have made incredible inroads into the fields of engineering, transportation, and healthcare. Among additive manufacturing technologies, 3D printing is gradually emerging as a powerful technique owing to a combination of attractive features, such as fast prototyping, fabrication of complex designs/structures, minimization of waste generation, and easy mass customization. Of late, 4D printing has also been initiated, which is the sophisticated version of the 3D printing. It has an extra advantageous feature: retaining shape memory and being able to provide instructions to the printed parts on how to move or adapt under some environmental conditions, such as, water, wind, light, temperature, or other environmental stimuli. This advanced printing utilizes the response of smart manufactured materials, which offer the capability of changing shapes postproduction over application of any forms of energy. The potential application of 4D printing in the biomedical field is huge. Here, the technology could be applied to tissue engineering, medicine, and configuration of smart biomedical devices. Various characteristics of next generation additive printings, namely 3D and 4D printings, and their use in enhancing the manufacturing domain, their development, and some of the applications have been discussed. Special materials with piezoelectric properties and shape-changing characteristics have also been discussed in comparison with conventional material options for additive printing.

Porous Mg-Zn-Zr based BJP samples were assessed for corrosion performance in simulated body fluids by electrochemical and hydrogen evolution measurements. The corrosion rates of the BJP specimens were significantly higher than solid controls, even after accounting for their larger surface areas, suggesting that the BJP microstructure is detrimental to corrosion performance. X-ray computed tomography revealed nonuni-form corrosion within the porous structure, with corrosion products forming on the pore walls.

This work is to study the strength of the PLA in varied conditions by incorporating physical transformations through internal structuring using additive manufacturing technology and surface modifications using chemical reactions. The mechanical stability and behaviour of the 3D model depend on its internal structure. The internal structure of the model can be changed using various designing software before feeding into 3D printer. The most promis-ing hexagonal grid shape is incorporated to attain immense load bearing strength with minimal material usage by bio mimicking from nature (honeycomb structure). The surface of the plastic model is proposed with a metallic coat on its surface to increase its mechanical resistance to wear and tear by undergoing a sequence of chemical reactions. The mechanical characteristics like compressive strength and Shore 'D' hardness of the normally 3D printed PLA specimen (SAMPLE 1) and metal (Nickel) deposited 3D printed PLA specimen (SAMPLE 2) is compared. The compressive strength of the coated sample has shown an increase in the value compared to the pure PLA 3D model. The shore D hardness value for the sample 2 is decreased, which shows an increase in the smoothness of the material.Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Also, there is a large diversity of materials used in different AM processes. In the present paper, a methodology is proposed to evaluate, in different directions, the performance of an AM process and material characterization in terms of surface quality. This methodology consists of eight steps, based on a new surface inspection artifact and basic artifact orientations. The proposed artifact with several design configurations fits different AM systems sizes and meets the needs of customers. The effects of main factors on the surface roughness of up-facing platens of the artifacts are investigated using the statistical design of experiments. The proposed methodology is validated by a case study focused on PolyJet material jetting technology. Samples are manufactured of photopolymer resins and post-processed. Three factors (i.e., artifact orientation, platen orientation, and finish type) are considered for the investigation. The case study results show that the platen orientation, finish type, and their interaction have a significant influence on the surface roughness (Ra). The best Ra roughness results were obtained for the glossy finish type in the range of 0.5-4 m.

It is known that the quality of a 3D printed sample is closely connected to the rheological properties of the polymer matrix. However, some printing parameters, such as the feed rate and the print speed, might not be determined only by equipment design as usually reported in the literature. Instead, the thermal and rheological properties of the polymers should be carefully considered. The focus of many studies has relied on optimizing the specific properties of an ME printer through the adjustment of the printing parameters. Still, few researchers have shown how the rheological behaviour of a material can affect its final properties. Therefore, this paper would like to answer satisfactorily some recurring questions with clear practical importance, which is related to the fact that some materials have better print quality than others do and about the feasible margins for increasing the print speed according to the characteristics of a polymeric material. Thus, in this work, rheological characterization of the resins was conducted and it was detected that the processing condition for a specific thermoplastic is highly dependent on its rheological behaviour. A method of mass flow conservation was presented for determination and consideration of the rheological characteristics when selecting an appropriate process parameter for the additive manufacturing system. It was found that even a small recovery strain resulting from the characteristic morphology of ABS could provide lower layers' roughness and good printing quality to the 3D printed samples. Thus, the main goal of this work was to evaluate the importance of the rheological properties of common thermoplastics used in extrusion-based process on the controlling of a 3D printer and on the final printing quality.

This is particularly true when referred to the macroscopic dimensions of the resulting scaffold, but focussing on the microstructure that should be realized to offer a suitable environment to the seeded cells, possible drawbacks can be highlighted. In this regard, the present study shows the design and validation of a custom-made set-up capable to deliver thin polymeric strands, below 100 mu m diameter, to be used for building up scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. The aim of this work was to develop a specific experimental set-up capable of producing fine polymeric structures by means of a computer-controlled polymer deposition. As manufacturing method a variation of Pressure Assisted Microsyringe was chosen, namely the wet-spinning microsyringe deposition, driven by positive displacement as a trade-off between implementation complexity and extrusion speed control. For this purpose the project started with the design stage to select the proper hardware, especially for micro-positioning system's accuracy, then followed by a software development step to carefully control the setup. Experimental verification was carried out by depositing repeatable polymer filaments of poly(epsilon-caprolactone), widely used for tissue engineering applications. In order to preliminarily evaluate the feasibility of the desired outcome, a computational fluid dynamics analysis was carried out simulating a perfusion bioreactor operating at three different conditions. The results, either experimental and numerical, showed the potential of this combined study (i) to carefully select the most relevant processing parameters for collecting suitable strands and (ii) to predict the related response when assembled to form a 3D scaffold in terms of local fluid dynamics.

J	Tu, RW; Kim, HC; Sodano, H				Tu, Ruowen; Kim, Hyun Chan; Sodano, Henry			Additive Manufacturing of High-Temperature Thermoplastic Polysulfone with Tailored Microstructure via Precipitation Printing	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						precipitation printing; additive manufacturing; polysulfone; high-temperaturethermoplastic; microstructuretailoring	SOLVENT; PERFORMANCE; STRENGTH	Current additive manufacturing processes for polymers, including material extrusion, vat photopolymerization, material jetting, and powder bed fusion, have limitations in manufacturing high-temperature thermoplastics including narrow material selection, compromised mechanical properties, and potential degradation of materials during processing. Polysulfone (PSU) is a high-temperature thermoplastic with outstanding chemical resistance, flame retardancy, and toughness. However, besides injection molding, additive manufacturing of PSU has only been achieved through extrusion or solvent-cast three-dimensional (3D) printing without obtaining high mechanical properties. In this work, precipitation printing is applied to fabricate high-temperature thermoplastics such as PSU for the first time, where tailoring of the microstructure and mechanical properties is enabled through control of solvents and printing parameters. The printed PSU can either be dense and strong with 2.47 GPa Young's modulus and 70.6 MPa tensile strength or porous and highly anisotropic. After drying at a maximum temperature of 190 degrees C, both the printed dense and porous PSU samples have a glass-transition temperature of about 200 degrees C, which allows them to be used in high-temperature environments. Thus, precipitation printing provides an alternative approach to manufacture high-temperature thermoplastics like PSU with scalability and tailorable properties.

Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was performed to quantify loss factor as a function of applied dynamic strain. In addition, DMA was performed at varying temperatures to give insight into the molecular interactions present in these composites. Insight into the microstructure was provided by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results are compared to neat ABS and ABS/CNT systems processed through an injection molding technique. Results show large energy dissipation, accompanied by permanent damage, in both injection molded and additively manufactured neat ABS samples. In contrast, the additively manufactured ABS/CNT nanocomposites exhibited strain energy dissipation but reduced the effect of cavitation and crazing by possible reinforcement. This result suggests CNT fillers have the potential to alter the dissipation mechanisms present in additively manufactured structures to control structural damping. This research provides insight into the design and additive manufacturing of materials where energy dissipation is essential to maintain structural stability and functionality under dynamic loading.

This is mainly because of the contact needed and the slow heat transfer from the conventional hotend to the composite filaments. A microwave heating assisted additive manufacturing method is here presented which allows manufacturing CCFRP with a higher speed as compared to conventional methods. The permittivity of printed specimens with different fiber volume fraction was investigated. By using the measured dielectric properties, a micro-scale microwave radiation and heat transfer model between the fiber and resin matrix has been established. The skin-core temperature difference of the moving CCFRP filaments during conventional thermal and microwave heating has been simulated to reveal the relationship between the temperature difference, filament diameter and printing speed. Non-isothermal crystallization behavior and mechanical strengths of thermal and microwave printed specimens have been studied, and the reasons for the different results have been analyzed.

The Effect of Extrusion Temperature and Cycles on Electrical Resistivity in Carbon Nanofiber-Modified PLA Filament for Multi-Functional Additive Manufacturing	SENSORS AND SMART STRUCTURES TECHNOLOGIES FOR CIVIL, MECHANICAL, AND AEROSPACE SYSTEMS 2020	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Sensors and Smart Structures Technologies for Civil, Mechanical, and Aerospace Systems	APR 27-MAY 08, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	SPIE		polymer electrical conductivity; filament manufacturing; fused deposition; additive manufacturing	SINGLE	Multi-functional additive manufacturing is a promising route to achieving exciting new rapid prototyping and in-the-field manufacturing capabilities. Ideally, multi-functionality could be imparted to materials that can be used with existing additive manufacturing hardware with little-to-no modification of the hardware. However, because much of the additive manufacturing hardware currently available is highly sensitive to the properties of the input material, it is important to understand the relationship among the processing/development of the input material, its physical properties, and quality and properties of the additively manufactured part. To that end, this project explores the effects of processing conditions on the electrical properties and printability of nanofiller-modified fused deposition modeling (FDM) filament. Specifically, pulverized polylactic acid (PLA) is dry mixed with carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and extruded through a commercially available single-screw filament extruder. Filament resistivity and diameter are then statistically characterized as a function of extrusion temperature and number of extrusions. Printability is also quantitatively and qualitatively characterized using a commercial FDM printer. Insights developed through this work could be of considerable significance to next-generation additively manufactured piezoresistive-based sensors, actuators, and electrical components.

While progress in MMAM has been more gradual compared to single-material AM, significant strides have been made in exploring the scientific and technological possibilities of this emerging field. Researchers have conducted feasibility studies and investigated various processes for multi-material deposition, encompassing polymeric, metallic, and bio-materials. To facilitate further advancements, this review paper addresses the pressing need for a consolidated document on MMAM that can serve as a comprehensive guide to the state of the art. Previous reviews have tended to focus on specific processes or materials, overlooking the overall picture of MMAM. Thus, this pioneering review endeavors to synthesize the collective knowledge and provide a holistic understanding of the multiplicity of materials and multiscale processes employed in MMAM. The review commences with an analysis of the implications of multiplicity, delving into its advantages, applications, challenges, and issues. Subsequently, it offers a detailed examination of MMAM with respect to processes, materials, capabilities, scales, and structural aspects. Seven standard AM processes and hybrid AM processes are thoroughly scrutinized in the context of their adaptation for MMAM, accompanied by specific examples, merits, and demerits. The scope of the review encompasses material combinations in polymers, composites, metals-ceramics, metal alloys, and biomaterials. Furthermore, it explores MMAM's capabilities in fabricating bi-metallic structures and functionally/compositionally graded materials, providing insights into various scale and structural aspects. The review culminates by outlining future research directions in MMAM and offering an overall outlook on the vast potential of multiplicity in this field. By presenting a comprehensive and integrated perspective, this paper aims to catalyze further breakthroughs in MMAM, thus propelling the next generation of multi-functional component manufacturing to new heights by capitalizing on the unprecedented possibilities of MMAM.

One of the most promising fields of application are wearable devices, which can be directly printed on textiles. This paper aims to study adhesion forces and warping effects when depositing a polymer onto a textile with a low-cost extrusion 3D printer. To achieve this, two different polymers (PLA and Filaflex) and six of the most common textile materials were selected. L-shaped specimens were printed by combining the two polymers and the six textiles. Most of the common printing settings were fixed for both materials, while the layer quality was 0.1 mm and 0.2 mm. Once printed, they were inspected with a Coordinate Measuring Machine and the deformation of each specimen was quantified by calculating their maximum and minimum displacements. Afterwards, each specimen was axially tested to evaluate the adhesion forces between the polymer and the textile. In terms of warping, flexible filament showed the lowest values independent of printing quality (0.56 mm and 0.3 mm) relative to the rigid filament (0.73 mm and 0.8 mm). In terms of adhesion, the combination of a porous textile and a flexible filament got the highest values, regardless of the layer height selected. The conclusion of this study is that polymer textile deposition can be a real manufacturing strategy that should be considered when thinking about the design of a wearable device to be worn on the body.

For this purpose, both the surface topography as well as the chemical composition of 3D scaffolds fabricated by additive manufacturing were modified. The scaffolds were fabricated by fused deposition modeling (FDM) using high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) filaments. The surface of the objects was then topographically modified providing materials with porous surfaces by means of the Breath Figures approach. The strategy involves the immersion of the scaffold in a polymer solution during a precise period of time. This approach permitted the modification of the pore size varying the immersion time as well as the solution concentration. Moreover, by using polymer blend solutions of polystyrene and polystyrene-b-poly(acrylic acid) (PS23-b-PAA(18)) and a quaternized polystyrene-b-poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PS42-b-PDMAEMAQ(17)), the scaffolds were simultaneously chemically modified. The surfaces were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy. Finally, the biological response toward bacteria was explored. Porous surfaces prepared using quaternized PDMAEMA as well as those prepared using PAA confer antimicrobial activity to the films, i.e., were able to kill on contact Staphylococcus aureus employed as model bacteria.

A thermal treatment is performed after manufacturing the nanocomposites, triggering the reduction of KAuCl4 into AuNPs in solid state. In this approach, the photo -polymerization of the resin and the formation of the AuNPs occur independently, allowing the optimization of these two processes separately. Advanced electron microscopy analyses reveal the distribution, size and morphology of the AuNPs synthesized within the resin, showing the influence of the gold precursor concentration and different thermal treatments. The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the AuNPs modifies the optical properties of the 3D-printed nanocomposites, yielding transparent yet colored materials even for con-centrations as low as 0.1 wt% KAuCl4. This behavior can be modelled by the Mie theory, correlating the macroscopic properties of the nanocomposites with the individual AuNPs embedded in the resin. The possibility of tuning the LSPR of the AuNPs together with the ability of manufacturing 3D-structures with sub-millimeter precision by SL, paves the way for the design of advanced platforms for plasmonics, such as sensors for sur-face enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).

Though nanomaterials can add impressive properties to nanocomposites (NCs), there are expansive amounts of opportunities that are left unexplored by simply combining AM with NCs without discovering synergistic effects and novel emerging material properties that are not possible by each of these alone. Cooperative, evolving properties of NCs in AM can be investigated at the processing, morphological, and architectural levels. Each of these categories are studied as a function of the amplifying relationship between nanomaterials and AM, with each showing the systematically selected material and method to advance the material performance, explore emergent properties, as well as improve the AM process itself. Innovative, advanced materials are key to faster development cycles in disruptive technologies for bioengineering, defense, and transportation sectors. This is only possible by focusing on synergism and amplification within additive manufacturing of nanocomposites.

J	Sillani, F; de Gasparo, F; Schmid, M; Wegener, K				Sillani, Francesco; de Gasparo, Fabian; Schmid, Manfred; Wegener, Konrad			Influence of packing density and fillers on thermal conductivity of polymer powders for additive manufacturing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Thermal conductivity; Powder; Polymer; Powder bed fusion; Selective laser sintering; Duraform PA12; Transient hot wire; Duraform HST; iCoPP; Composite; Compaction behavior; SmarTap		Additive manufacturing of polymer powders is nowadays an industrial production technology. Complex thermal phenomena occur during processing, mainly related to the interaction dynamics among laser, powder, and heating system, and also to the subsequent cool-down phase from the melt to the parts. Thermal conductivity of the powder is a key property for material processing, since an inhomogeneous temperature field in the powder cake leads to uneven part properties and can strongly limit productivity because only a smaller portion of the build chamber can be used. Nevertheless, little is known about the relationship between thermal conductivity, packing density, and presence of fillers, which are used to enhance specific properties such as high temperature resistance or stiffness. The development and consequent validation of a device capable of measuring thermal conductivity as a function of powder packing density are then extremely important, providing an additional tool to characterize powders during the development process of new materials for PBF of polymers. The results showed a positive correlation between packing density and thermal conductivity for some commercially available materials, with an increase of the latter of about 10 to 40% with an increase of the packing density from 0 to 100%. Problems arose in trying to replicate the compaction state of the powder, since the same amount of taps led to a different packing density, but this is a known problem of measuring free-flowing powders such as the ones used for additive manufacturing. Regarding fillers, an increase of about 40 to 70% of thermal conductivity when inorganic fillers such as carbon fibers are added to the neat polymer was observed, and the expected behavior following the rule of mixture was only partially observed.

Polymers are materials of central importance for AM specifically for fabrication of original and customized parts. However, most of the polymers currently in use derive from fossil sources, which extensive use represents a critical issue for the environment. This scenario encourages the use of sustainable and biodegradable biopolymers. The present paper focuses on the study of the printability of a bio-based powder, starting from an aromatic-aliphatic biodegradable polyester, poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), as sustainable alternative for Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) conventional materials. Bio-based polymers represent environmentally friendly materials that can be suitable for AM, although several problems still need to be solved for SLS applications. In fact, it is challenging to produce polymeric powders with specific particle size and size distribution, spherical shape, good flowability and processability. From this point of view, PBAT powder was prepared by means of an emulsion solvent evaporation method, characterized from morphological and thermal points of view, and then successfully used for SLS process, with the aim to obtain novel 3D printed objects using for the first time this biodegradable polymer.

Self-lubricating radial bearings are one of the machine elements that can be produced using additive manufacturing. In this research, we present a machine learning-based approach to model the friction coefficient and friction torque in self-lubricating radial bearings manufactured by additive manufacturing using polyether ether ketone (PEEK), polylactic acid (PLA), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and nylon. The proposed approach includes different machine learning models (artificial neural networks, support vector machines, regression trees, linear regression models) that utilize experimental data to predict the coefficient of friction and friction torque of different types of radial bearings. Experimental data were obtained by performing tribological tests on self-lubricating radial bearings under various operating conditions. The results reveal that the machine learning models are successful in predicting the friction coefficient and friction torque in self-lubricating radial bearings with high accuracy. The approach can be utilized to optimize the design and performance of self-lubricating radial bearings manufactured using additive manufacturing.

Pore volume and architecture can be designed in a controlled fashion, resulting in a modulation of scaffold's mechanical properties and in an optimal nutrient perfusion determinant for cell survival. However, the success of an engineered tissue architecture is often linked to its surface properties as well. The aim of this study was to create a family of polymeric pastes comprised of poly(ethylene oxide therephthalate)/poly(butylene terephthalate) (PEOT/PBT) microspheres and of a second biocompatible polymeric phase acting as a binder. By combining microspheres with additive manufacturing technologies, we produced 3D scaffolds possessing a tailorable surface roughness, which resulted in improved cell adhesion and increased metabolic activity. Furthermore, these scaffolds may offer the potential to act as drug delivery systems to steer tissue regeneration.</p>	[Higuera, Gustavo A.; Di Luca, Andrea; Pechkov, Nicholas; de Wijn, Joost R.] Univ Twente, Inst BioMed Technol & Tech Med MIRA, Tissue Regenerat Dept, Enschede, Netherlands; [Ramos, Tiago] UCL, Inst Ophthalmol, London, England; [Gloria, Antonio; Ambrosio, Luigi] Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Polymers Composites & Biomat, Naples, Italy; [van Blitterswijk, Clemens A.; Moroni, Lorenzo] Maastricht Univ, MERLN Inst Technol Inspired Regenerat Med, Complex Tissue Regenerat Dept, Maastricht, Netherlands	University of Twente; University of London; University College London; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per i Polimeri, Compositi e Biomateriali (IPCB-CNR); Maastricht University; Maastricht University Medical Centre (MUMC)	Moroni, L (corresponding author), Maastricht Univ, MERLN Inst Technol Inspired Regenerat Med, Complex Tissue Regenerat Dept, Maastricht, Netherlands.	l.moroni@maastrichtuniversity.nl	Moroni, Lorenzo/D-2826-2014	Moroni, Lorenzo/0000-0003-1298-6025; Gloria, Antonio/0000-0001-5233-5687	Dutch Province of Limburg	Dutch Province of Limburg	This project research has been made possible with the support of the Dutch Province of Limburg.		75	1	1	9	18	FRONTIERS MEDIA SA	LAUSANNE	AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND	2296-4185			FRONT BIOENG BIOTECH	Front.

Robust connections with strong interfacial strength and low interfacial impedance are highly desired in all kinds of flexible devices, especially when they require stretchability. Here, a new strategy of employing homogeneity is proposed to facilely achieve robust connection without introducing a third-party interlayer. The key to this strategy is implementing different functions in the same component materials, and in this work, this strategy is demonstrated by exploring the uniformity of carbon nanotube (CNT) in thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) elastomer. Tuning the uniformity of CNT in TPU elastomer, two kinds of CNT-TPU composites (CTCs) are fabricated. They present contrasting properties of conductivity (281 folds), Young's modulus (7.1 folds), and strain sensitivity (15.7 folds) with the same weight fraction of CNT (15 wt %), and thus they can respectively act as strain sensor and interconnector in all-CNT-based stretchable strain monitoring electronics. The interlocking effect caused by spontaneous entanglement of surface polymer chains and the reconstruction of percolation network at the interface during drying confer the connection with robustness. The practical value of this strategy has been exemplified by the fabrication of a robust epidermis device via additive manufacturing. This epidermis device is patterned in a fractal motif for conformal contact and can sensitively monitor body motions and radial artery pulse.

During the fabrication process, polymeric material in a molten state is deposited in a platform and starts to solidify while cooling down. The build-up of consecutive layers reheats the previously deposited material, introducing a complex thermal cycle with impacts on the overall properties of printed scaffolds. Therefore, the accurate prediction of these thermal cycles is significantly important to properly design the additively manufactured polymer scaffolds and the bonding between the layers. This paper presents a novel multi-stage numerical model, integrating a 2D representation of the dynamic deposition process and a 3D thermal evolution model to simulate the fabrication process. Numerical simulations show how the deposition velocity controls the spatial dimensions of the individual deposition layers and the cooling process when consecutive layers are deposited during polymer printing. Moreover, numerical results show a good agreement with experimental results.

An additive manufacturing process for polymer-based biocompatible neural sensors for chronic application towards individualized implants is here presented. To process thermal crosslinking polymers, the developed extrusion process enables, in combination with an infrared (IR)-Laser, accelerated curing directly after passing the outlet of the nozzle. As a result, no additional curing steps are necessary during the build-up. Furthermore, the minimal structure size can be achieved using the laser and, in combination with the extrusion parameters, provide structural resolutions desired. Active implant components fabricated using biocompatible materials for both conductive pathways and insulating cladding keep their biocompatible properties even after the additive manufacturing process. In addition, first characterization of the electric properties in terms of impedance towards application in neural tissues are shown. The printing toolkit developed enables processing of low-viscous, flexible polymeric thermal curing materials for fabrication of individualized neural implants.

Feedstocks for additive manufacturing were tested as filament and manufactured casts, while the cast from consumer-grade filament (CGF) was post-processed. Samples were extracted using three solvents of varying polarities. Extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) techniques. In GC/MS analysis, isopropanol extracts generated fewer compound identifications for USP Class VI filament (USPF)-based casts (3) compared with the respective filament (17) while hexane generated the most compound identifications for the finished cast manufactured from CGF. CGF was found to have the highest number of nonvolatile extractables for isopropanol (15) and hexane (34) by positive ion LC/MS. Additionally, CGF produced more non-polar extractables in hexane than the USPF. A known polymer byproduct and potential genotoxicant, styrene acrylonitrile (SAN) trimer, was one of the compounds identified in both GC/MS and LC/MS at quantities ranging from 19 to 270 mu g g(-1). Overall these results suggested that the extractables profile was affected by the filament material, printing procedure, and post-processing method.

J	Beyer, C; Figueroa, D				Beyer, Christiane; Figueroa, Dustin			Design and Analysis of Lattice Structures for Additive Manufacturing	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article						additive manufacturing; lattice structure design; unit cell; weight reduction; compressive test; flexural test		Additive manufacturing (AM) enables time and cost savings in the product development process. It has great potential in the manufacturing of lighter parts or tools by the embedding of cellular/lattice structures that consume less material while still distributing the necessary strength. Less weight and less material consumption can lead to enormous energy and cost savings. Although AM has come a long way over the past 25-30 years since the first technology was invented, the design of parts and tools that capitalize on the technology do not yet encompass its full potential. Designing for AM requires departing from traditional design guidelines and adopting new design considerations and thought structures. Where previous manufacturing techniques (computer numerical control (CNC) machining, casting, etc.) often necessitated solid parts, AM allows for complex parts with cellular and lattice structure implementation. The lattice structure geometry can be manipulated to deliver the level of performance required of the part. The development and research of different cell and lattice structures for lightweight design is of significant interest for realizing the full potential of AM technologies. The research not only includes analysis of existing software tools to design and optimize cell structures, but it also involves design consideration of different unit cell structures. This paper gives a solid foundation of an experimental analysis of additive manufactured parts with diverse unit cell structures in compression and flexural tests. Although the research also includes theoretical finite element analysis (FEA) of the models, the results are not considered here. As an introduction, the paper briefly explains the basics of stress and strain relationship and summarizes the test procedure and methods. The tests concentrate primarily on the analysis of 3D printed polymer parts manufactured using PolyJet technology. The results show the behavior of test specimens with different cell structures under compression and bending load. However, the research has been extended and is still ongoing with an analysis of selective laser melted test specimens in aluminum alloy AlSi10Mg.

In particular, this paper focuses on creating graphene-polymer composite FGM by laser-based sintering processes. Graphene-polymer composites have received high attention in AM due to their excellent electrical conductivity, thermal stability and mechanical strength. However, AM of the graphene-polymer composites has a huge challenge to overcome. The heterogeneous materials should be mixed properly, and it is not easy to achieve the desired composite characteristics solely by changing the mass ratio of graphene. This paper shows a newly developed laser-assisted AM system for the graphene-polymer composite FGM by laser-based sintering processes. The paper also describes two methods of material integration: mixing graphene and polyethylene powders before sintering, and depositing the different material powders separately and sintering them. This study identified that the two methods led to different mechanical and electrical properties of the created parts. Thus this paper demonstrates the possibility to create quite useful hybrid (mechanically and electrically) FGM composites.

The present review focuses on designing electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials by 3D printing. The various raw materials such as polylactic acid (PLA), polypropylene, graphene, carbon nanotube (CNT), multiwalled carbon nanotube (MCNT), and so forth, can be successfully used for making effective EMI shielding performances in different frequency ranges. These raw materials have prepared diverse shapes, dimensions, and compositions to attenuate the incident radiations over the shielding material's surface and ultimately protect the electronic devices. When mixed with carbon nanotubes, PLA has been shown 8-15 dB, 30 dB, and 67 dB EMI SE in different frequency ranges, a material with ABS and CNT have -3 to -16 dB reflection loss in X-band frequency. Also graphene nanofilm/MWCNT composition has shown EMI SE as high as 43-54 dB in X-band ranges when printed with poly jet printing. These properties gave a cutting-edge rivalry to the conventional fabrication method and proved that 3D printing is better when designing innovation for EMI shielding materials	[Verma, Sarika; Dhangar, Manish; Mili, Medha; Bajpai, Harsh; Khan, Mohammed Akram; Bhargaw, Hari Narayan; Hashmi, Sayed Azhar Rasheed; Srivastava, Avanish Kumar] CSIR, Adv Mat & Proc Res Inst, Bhopal, India; [Verma, Sarika; Mili, Medha; Khan, Mohammed Akram; Bhargaw, Hari Narayan; Hashmi, Sayed Azhar Rasheed; Srivastava, Avanish Kumar] Acad Council Sci & Ind Res, Adv Mat & Proc Res Inst AMPRI, Bhopal, India; [Dwivedi, Umesh; Kumari, Neelam] Amity Univ Rajasthan, Amity Sch Appl Sci, Dept Phys, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India	Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Advanced Materials & Processes Research Institute (AMPRI); Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Advanced Materials & Processes Research Institute (AMPRI)	Verma, S (corresponding author), CSIR, Adv Mat & Proc Res Inst, Bhopal, India.	sarika.verma@amprises.in			CSIR, New Delhi, India [MLP 0201]	CSIR, New Delhi, India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India)	The work's motivation was due to the support of CSIR, New Delhi, India (Grant No. MLP 0201).

J	O'Connor, HJ; Dowling, DP				O'Connor, Heather J.; Dowling, Denis P.			Evaluation of the influence of low pressure additive manufacturing processing conditions on printed polymer parts	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Material extrusion; Low pressure; Vacuum chamber; Tensile strength	ACRYLONITRILE-BUTADIENE-STYRENE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; BEHAVIOR; PLA; FDM; PROPERTY; TENSILE; ABS	The properties of 3-D printed polymeric parts depend significantly on the processing conditions under which they are fabricated. This study aims to determine how the use of low-pressure additive manufacturing (AM) processing conditions, influences the mechanical performance of printed polymeric parts. This polymer material extrusion (PME) study was carried out using an open-source desktop printer, under both low pressure (1 Pa) and at atmospheric pressure. The printing study was carried out using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA) and a nylon co-polymer (PA6). The resultant polymer parts were compared based on their printed mass, density, volume, porosity, surface energy, ATR-IR analysis and thermal properties (DSC). As expected only minor differences in chemical functionality were observed between parts printed under the two processing pressures. Under low-pressure printing conditions, the polymer parts exhibited some physical changes, when compared to those, printed under atmospheric conditions, such as an increase in density and a decrease in porosity. This was observed in particular with the low-pressure printing of PA6 parts, which exhibited an increase in density from 1.095 to 1.113 g/cm(3) and a decrease in porosity by 8%. Comparing low pressure printed type V dog bones (ASTM D-638), with those printed at atmospheric pressure, it was observed that the ABS, PLA and PA6 exhibited an increase in Ultimate Tensile Strength of 9%, 13% and 42% respectively. It is proposed that the superior mechanical properties obtained for polymers printed under low pressure conditions, may be due to a combination of two factors. These are the reduction in porosity of the printed part and the reduction in heat loss at the printed polymer surface, yielding enhanced bonding between the polymer layers. In a further printing study carried out at atmospheric pressure in a nitrogen atmosphere, it was also demonstrated that any oxidation of the polymer layers during printing, did not significantly influence the mechanical properties of the resultant printed parts.

Therefore, the challenges of this task are considered verifying the critical process steps in order to develop a concept for an electrophotograhic laser sintering machine. On that basis, an experimental setup with a two-chamber design is realized which enables the investigation of the electrophotographic powder transfer at typical process conditions of SLS. Using this setup, transfer tests of polypropylene powder patterns were performed and qualitatively analyzed by photographic imaging. The results confirm the high potential of the application of electrophotography for multi-material powder deposition and show how a residual electrophotographic powder deposition can be achieved in general, which is independent from the already produced part height, in order to build up three-dimensional multi-material components.

This method uses materials extrusion processes to extrude inks composed of oxide powders, plastic binders, and solvents. Oxide powders are synthesized into viscous inks and extruded under ambient conditions into three-dimensional architectures. The three-dimensional printed green bodies are reduced at elevated temperatures in hydrogen-rich environments to burn off the polymer binder and reduce the oxide powders, yielding metal alloys with controlled compositions. While this approach has been demonstrated in previous publications for various alloys, the addition of carbon, an important element in most industrial steels, has been a persistent challenge. This paper demonstrates an approach to introduce carbon during the reduction process, resulting in through-thickness carburization of the final parts.

Additive manufacturing (AM) is a promising manufacturing technique being used to manufacture products with complex geometries, but it is a slow process producing mechanically inferior products when compared to traditional production processes like injection molding (IM). Thus, our hybrid manufacturing (HM) process combining materials extrusion AM and IM to create a single article was investigated in this study, in which eleven batches of specimens were made and extensively tested. These include the AM, IM, and hybrid manufactured (HYM) samples, in which the HYM samples were made by inserting AM substrates into the IM tool and were varied in infill density of AM preforms and geometries. The HYM samples outperformed AM parts in terms of mechanical performance while retaining customizability dependent on the HYM processing parameters, and the best mechanical performance for HYM samples was found to be comparable to that of IM samples, implying that the overmolding process in HM had primarily improved the mechanical performance of AM products. This work leads to a deeper knowledge of applications to confirm the optimal component fabrication in high design flexibility and mass production.

We used pneumatic extrusion nozzles to extrude the liquid material and then cured it by an ultraviolet (UV) light source. The multi-nozzle pneumatic extrusion-based additive manufacturing system mainly integrates both PC-based HMI and CNC controller to operate the three-axis motion and the extrusion flow control. Moreover, the peripheral I/Os include both positive and negative pressure and also the curing light source. A D/A controller is also applied to control the value of the pneumatic pressure. The coding part utilizes the numerical control software along with the PLC planning to operate the AM machine automatically. Our experiment is conducted by using Simplify3D, a commercial 3D printing slicing software. Different requirements were set for extrusion nozzles with different materials, and then we executed the path controlling G-code data by Python Language. Our system successfully prints multi-material polymer structure pads which include the hard and soft material pad fabricated in double-layers, triple-layers and also the grid structure.

PART; OF-THE-ART; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; DIMENSIONAL ACCURACY; MILLING MACHINES; STEREOLITHOGRAPHY; STRENGTH; CROWNS; MICROSTRUCTURE	Additive manufacturing (AM) has many advantages and became a valid manufacturing technique for polymers and metals in dentistry. However, its application for dental ceramics is still in process. Among dental ceramics, zirconia is becoming popular and widely used in dentistry mainly due to its outstanding properties. Although subtractive technology or milling is the state of art for manufacturing zirconia restorations but still has shortcomings. Utilizing AM in fabricating ceramics restorations is a new topic for many researchers and companies across the globe and a good understanding of AM of zirconia is essential for dental professional. Therefore, the aim of this narrative review is to illustrate different AM technologies available for processing zirconia and discus their advantages and future potential. A comprehensive literature review was completed to summarize different AM technologies that are available to fabricate zirconia and their clinical application is reported. The results show a promising outcome for utilizing AM of zirconia in restorative, implant and regenerative dentistry. However further improvements and validation is necessary to approve its clinical application.

J	Goutier, M; Hilbig, K; Vietor, T; Böl, M				Goutier, Marijn; Hilbig, Karl; Vietor, Thomas; Boel, Markus			Process Parameters and Geometry Effects on Piezoresistivity in Additively Manufactured Polymer Sensors	POLYMERS			English	Article						conductive polymer composite; resistive sensor; piezoresistive sensor; process parameters; design for additive manufacturing; conductive filament; additive manufacturing; 3D printing; material extrusion; fused deposition modeling	3D; NANOCOMPOSITES	The current work experimentally determined how the initial resistance and gauge factor in additively manufactured piezoresistive sensors are affected by the material, design, and process parameters. This was achieved through the tensile testing of sensors manufactured with different infill angles, layer heights, and sensor thicknesses using two conductive polymer composites. Linear regression models were then used to analyze which of the input parameters had significant effects on the sensor properties and which interaction effects existed. The findings demonstrated that the initial resistance in both materials was strongly dependent on the sensor geometry, decreasing as the cross-sectional area was increased. The resistance was also significantly influenced by the layer height and the infill angle, with the best variants achieving a resistance that was, on average, 22.3% to 66.5% lower than less-favorable combinations, depending on the material. The gauge factor was most significantly affected by the infill angle and, depending on the material, by the layer height. Of particular interest was the finding that increasing in the infill angle resulted in an increase in the sensitivity that outweighed the associated increase in the initial resistance, thereby improving the gauge factor by 30.7% to 114.6%, depending on the material.

Shape recovery analysis of the additive manufactured 3D smart surfaces through reverse engineering	PROGRESS IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Shape memory polymer; 3D modelling; 3D laser scanning; 3D shape and deformation measurement; Reverse engineering	SCANNING TECHNOLOGY	Novel methodology to estimate the shape memory behavior of smart structure fabricated by additive manufacturing is presented by merging 3D laser scanning and reverse engineering (RE). The specimens made from a temperature-stimulated smart material-PLA, is printed by fused deposition modelling (FDM), which adds the functionality of shape memory with additive manufacturing. Initially, to verify the estimation of shape memory behavior, standard rectangular samples are designed, printed, scanned and regenerated by RE. The results of the shape memory analyses are in close agreement with the previous works, which validate the methodology to be adopted from more complex geometries. Subsequently, the procedure is employed to the three-dimensional paraboloid surface for the development of surfaces during the different phases of the cycle. Successful rapid restoration of all the surfaces has been achieved with the accurate measurements which could be a time-consuming process using the conventional measurement techniques or involve high sophistication methodology. The shape recovery and shape fixity of the paraboloid surfaces are in congruence with the values calculated for the standard samples. RE models are also used to estimate the effect of stresses applied during the programming stage and subsequent release of internal stresses in the recovery stage above the glass transition temperature of PLA.

Comparison of Theoretical and Practical Studies of Energy Input in Laser Additive Manufacturing (LAM) Using Stainless Steel	LASERS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Laser additive manufacturing (LAM); additive manufacturing (AM); stainless steel; energy heat affected zone (HAZ)		Laser additive manufacturing (LAM), known also as laser sintering, is an additive manufacturing process where powder material is molten with laser beam layer by layer. From simple to very complex three-dimensional (3-D) geometries can be manufactured to solid components from metallic, ceramic, composite or polymer powder. Methods to control the process have started to gain an essential role in laser additive manufacturing processes. The objective of this study was to investigate laser additive manufacturing monitoring methods and find suitable method for detection and calculation of thermal features. The LAM process was monitored in situ simultaneously with pyrometer and active illumination system. Energy input and volumetric energy density were compared. for energy evaluation. In the study it was noticed that an increase in energy input to the range of 250 to 2000 J/m results in ball formation. Homogenous and non porous evenly distributed surface was achieved with energy input of 2500 J/m. Energy input of 5000 J/m showed interesting phenomena; layer formed is the most uniform of all results. However, some unevenly distributed porosity is noticed. It can be concluded that with energy input the heat penetration start decreasing to this semi molten surface of the stainless steel powder. At the same time, a denser surface with less balling phenomena was obtained. Collapse of surface was observed with energy input of 10000 J/m. Such behaviour with this energy input on stainless steel suggests lower heating impact what might be caused by lower absorption.

The integration of AM with the other steps of conventional micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication processes is still in progress and, furthermore, the development of dedicated design methods for this field is under development. The large variety of AM processes and materials is leading to an abundance of documentation about process attempts, setup details, and case studies. However, the fast and multi-technological development of AM methods for microstructures will require organized analysis of the specific and comparative advantages, constraints, and limitations of the processes. The goal of this paper is to provide an up-to-date overall view on the AM processes at the microscale and also to organize and disambiguate the related performances, capabilities, and resolutions.

A second amputation is also required for 9% to 17% of these patients within the same year although LEA may be preventable. Most of the diabetic foot conditions may be prevented and treated by a therapeutic footwear or a medical device such as an insole or an orthotic shoe. Traditional insole manufacturing is a laborious work that requires specific skills. Moreover, traditional approaches contain harmful material particles that may cause respiratory failure. Unfortunately, manufactured insoles may not be suitable for any mass-produced footwear in all cases. Therefore, patient requires to get insole-specific footwear. In this study, a diabetic insole was manufactured by means of a fused deposition modeling-(FDM) based system and a thermoplastic polymer. Biomechanical functionality was determined according to the applied polymer analysis on each produced sample and foam material. Subsequently, finite element analysis (FEA) was performed to target insole geometry to ensure the quality of the final medical product. Additive and traditional manufactured insoles are compared according to the cost and function. As a result, fabrication of an insole, based on the FDM method, was improved down to 8 h and 9 m. The weight of an insole prototype was 74.74 g, and the material cost was $3.44 while total cost of the traditional foam casting was determined as $35.37 and weight of the insole was 72.6 g for this study. Consequently, benefits of the applied method are evaluated.

Incorporating a foaming agent into the filament material enables the FDM-printing of thermoplastic foams, which opens up new possibilities for achieving desired mechanical property combinations. This study explored the process-property design space of FDM-printed polylactic acid (PLA) foams. Tensile and compression specimens were produced at a wide range of printing parameters using a commercial thermoplastic filament containing a foaming agent. Increasing the nozzle temperature and decreasing the filament feed rate increased the extent of foaming. Adjustment of the nozzle temperature, feed rate, and infill ratio controlled porosity over a density range of 0.24 to 1.17 g/cm3. Tuning of the mechanical properties over an order of magnitude was demonstrated, with elastic moduli ranging from 0.24 to 3.7 GPa and tensile strength ranging from 4.2 to 34.5 MPa. The mechanical behavior closely followed the Gibson-Ashby model predictions. Foaming filaments provide a new tool for tuning the mechanical response of FDM-printed parts to achieve unique combinations of mechanical properties that are not attainable through conventional methods.

The mechanical and physical properties of large-volume components largely depend on their reinforcing fiber length. However, very few studies have been done thus far to have a direct comparison of additively fabricated composites reinforced with different carbon fiber lengths. In this study, a new additive manufacturing (AM) approach to fabricate long fiber-reinforced polymer (LFRP) was first proposed. A pellet-based extrusion deposition method was implemented, which directly used thermoplastic pellets and continuous fiber tows as feedstock materials. Discontinuous long carbon fibers, with an average fiber length of 20.1 mm, were successfully incorporated into printed LFRP samples. The printed LFRP samples were compared with short fiber-reinforced polymer (SFRP) and continuous fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) counterparts through mechanical tests and microstructural analyses. The carbon fiber dispersion, distribution of carbon fiber length and orientation, and fiber wetting were studied. As expected, a steady increase in flexural strength was observed with increasing fiber length. The carbon fibers were highly oriented along the printing direction. A more uniformly distributed discontinuous fiber reinforcement was found within printed SFRP and LFRP samples. Due to decreased fiber impregnation time and lowered impregnation rate, the printed CFRP samples showed a lower degree of impregnation and worse fiber wetting conditions. The feasibility of the proposed AM methods was further demonstrated by fabricating large-volume components with complex geometries.

Additive technology of soluble mold tooling for embedded devices in composite structures: A study on manufactured tolerances	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Soluble mold; Dimensional analysis; High impact polystyrene; Embedded devices; Composites	PART 1; OPTIMIZATION; ACCURACY; STRENGTH	Composite textiles have found widespread use and advantages in various industries and applications. The constant demand for high-quality products and services requires companies to minimize their manufacturing costs and delivery time in order to compete with general and niche marketplaces. Creation of molding and tooling options for advanced composites encompasses a large portion of fabrication time, making it a costly process and a restraining factor. This research discusses a preliminary investigation into the use and control of soluble polymer compounds and additive manufacturing to fabricate sacrificial molds. These molds suffer from dimensional errors due to several factors, which have also been characterized. The basic soluble mold of a composite is 3D printed to meet the desired dimensions and geometry of holistic structures or spliced components. The time taken to dissolve the mold depends on the rate of agitation of the solvent. This process is steered towards enabling the implantation of optoelectronic devices within the composite to provide a sensing capability for structural health monitoring. The shape deviation of the 3D printed mold is also studied and compared to its original dimensions to optimize the dimensional quality to produce dimensionally accurate parts of up to 0.02% error.

Four-dimensional (4D) printing helps enhance the geometrical flexibility of ceramics. However, ceramic 4D printing systems are limited by the separate processes for shape and material transformations, low accuracy of morphing systems, low resolution of ceramic structures, and their time-intensive nature. Here, a paradigm for a one-step shape/material transformation, high-2D/3D/4D-precision, high-efficiency, and scalable 4D additive-subtractive manufacturing of shape memory ceramics is developed. Original/reverse and global/local multimode shape memory capabilities are achieved using macroscale SiOC-based ceramic materials. The uniformly deposited Al2O3-rich layer on the printed SiOC-based ceramic lattice structures results in an unusually high flame ablation performance of the complex-shaped ceramics. The proposed framework is expected to broaden the applications of high-temperature structural materials in the aerospace, electronics, biomedical, and art fields.

Components consisted of various polymer composites with different compositions according to design was realized. High concentrations (up to 90%) of solid particle additives, including soda-lime glass, aluminum oxide, and copper powders, were mixed with the polymer and printed, which was difficult or impossible to realize using conventional injection molding or standard fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printing. Effects of laser melting/sintering parameters and manufacturing strategy of each type of polymeric composite were investigated. A successful delivery of very difficult-to-feed fine powder mixtures such as PA11/Al2O3 with irregular powder geometry via a new configuration of ultrasonic feeding was demonstrated. Three examples of 3D functionally graded components (part of a shoe sole, a turbine blade, and components of a ball bearing) were printed to illustrate the potential applications of the method.

However, the widely adopted 3-degree-of-freedom motion configuration in current CFRP-AM systems hinders the exploration of composite structures with non-planar fibre layouts. This work presents a novel conformal CFRP-AM system to fabricate grid-stiffened shell structures leveraging its multi-DoF motion to pattern spatial features. The system integrates a 6-axis robot with an optimally designed co-extrusion module and operates through a design-to-manufacturing workflow. The proposed workflow includes three steps: system calibration, conformal toolpath generation, and process implementation. The conformal toolpath generation is a surface-mapping-based method that allows a simultaneous exploration of various geometric designs and their toolpaths. Experimental comparisons were made between parts fabricated by different processes, i.e., planar and conformal based, with different toolpaths, i.e., shells filled with zigzag and arc-offset patterns, and with various geometric designs, i.e., stiffener ribs with different crossline angles. The results manifest that the proposed system can significantly improve the compression strength and stiffness of grid-stiffened shell structures. Meanwhile, the additional design freedom on process and structure opens up a new possibility to customise their mechanical performance.

J	Han, S; Zielewski, M; Holguin, DM; Parra, MM; Kim, N				Han, Seungkyu; Zielewski, Matthew; Holguin, David Martinez; Parra, Monica Michel; Kim, Namsoo			Optimization of AZ91D Process and Corrosion Resistance Using Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						additive manufacturing; WAAM; corrosion; AZ91D	IMPEDANCE PLANE DISPLAYS; STABILITY CONDITIONS; MAGNESIUM ALLOYS; STEADY-STATE; COMPOSITE; BEHAVIOR	Progress on Additive Manufacturing (AM) techniques focusing on ceramics and polymers evolves, as metals continue to be a challenging material to manipulate when fabricating products. Current methods, such as Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) and Electron Beam Melting (EBM), face many intrinsic limitations due to the nature of their processes. Material selection, elevated cost, and low deposition rates are some of the barriers to consider when one of these methods is to be used for the fabrication of engineering products. The research presented demonstrates the use of a Wire and Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) system for the creation of metallic specimens. This project explored the feasibility of fabricating elements made from magnesium alloys with the potential to be used in biomedical applications. It is known that the elastic modulus of magnesium closely approximates that of natural bone than other metals. Thus, stress shielding phenomena can be reduced. Furthermore, the decomposition of magnesium shows no harm inside the human body since it is an essential element in the body and its decomposition products can be easily excreted through the urine. By alloying magnesium with aluminum and zinc, or rare earths such as yttrium, neodymium, cerium, and dysprosium, the structural integrity of specimens inside the human body can be assured. However, the in vivo corrosion rates of these products can be accelerated by the presence of impurities, voids, or segregation created during the manufacturing process. Fast corrosion rates would produce improper healing, which, in turn, involve subsequent surgical intervention. However, in this study, it has been proven that magnesium alloy AZ91D produced by WAAM has higher corrosion resistance than the cast AZ91D. Due to its structure, which has porosity or cracking only at the surface of the individual printed lines, the central sections present a void-less structure composed by an HCP magnesium matrix and a high density of well dispersed aluminum-zinc rich precipitates. Also, specimens created under different conditions have been analyzed in the macroscale and microscale to determine the parameters that yield the best visual and microstructural results.

The microstructure analysis demonstrated no visible void content and excellent interfacial bonding. The bonding strength of the proposed method was evaluated through lap shear strength and peel strength testing; resulting in 50% higher peel strength than hot compaction method, with lap shear strength up to 96% of compression molding benchmark data. Tensile properties of components printed by our method were superior to those of fused deposition modeling (FDM) printed short fiber composites with 300% and 150% of increase in tensile strength and modulus, respectively. Tensile strength of our printed components was comparable to compression molding and stamping, however, tensile modulus was 50% lower in average. Flexural strength of the laser assisted AM parts was also in the range of stamping and compression molding methods, with flexural modulus up to 100% higher than these methods. Overall, our proposed new technique offers an alternative direction in AM of continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic polymer composites to solve the issues associated with current techniques.

These are also the first microfluidic devices with enclosed channels made from stainless steel by additive manufacturing. One important benefit of such fabrication methods is ultrafast prototyping, which we made use of in this study to optimize the performance of our fuel cells. The fabrication process consists of preparing a 3D model using a suitable computer-aided design software and then uploading the model file to the laser additive manufacturing machine. This process requires minimal manual intervention. The use of stainless steel as the fabrication material results in extremely durable, robust, chemically and thermally stable devices. Micro fuel cells with three different stainless steel flowfields were fabricated and characterized, two of which with enclosed channels, and one with traditional open grooves. Both enclosed channel flowfield fuel cells produced significantly higher power and current densities compared to the open groove counterpart: the maximum current density obtained was 1.515 A cm(-2) and maximum power density was 363 mW cm(-2).

This is achieved by combining Fused Filament Fabrication of polyetherimide based polymer with selective light-based synthesis of silver nanoparticles and electrochemical deposition of copper. The resultant manufacturing method produces devices with excellent DC electrical resistivity (6.68 mu Omega cm) and dielectric properties (relative permittivity of 2.67 and loss tangent of 0.001). Chemically modifying and patterning the substrate to produce the metallization overcomes many of the limitations of direct write deposition methods resulting in improved performance, adhesion and resolution of the antenna pattern. The fabricated demonstrators cover a broadband range of 0.1 GHz-10 GHz and the measured results show a direct agreement with the simulated design over a wide frequency band. Overall the materials used as a substrate have a low relative permittivity and lower dielectric loss than FR-4, thereby making them well suited for antenna applications.	[Esfahani, M. R.

The present research work aims to obtain smooth and stable Poly Lactic Acid (PLA)/Eggshell particles (E) composite filaments with enhanced mechanical and thermal properties for additive manufacturing applications. Composite filaments were developed by varying the ratio of E/PLA to 4-6-8-10-12 weight percentages (wt.%) using a single screw extruder. A study of physical, chemical, mechanical, and thermal properties for the manufactured filaments was made. The extruded filaments were subjected to thermal analysis using Melt Flow Index (MFI) to obtain the optimum value for AM applications. XRD analysis made on 4 wt.% eggshell revealed a higher crystallinity than neat PLA. The thermal results of neat PLA and various weight compositions of E revealed there is a decrease in thermal stability and thermal decomposition due to an increase in filler content. 4 wt.% of E shows the good tensile strength of 49.29 MPa with smooth and stable E/PLA composite filaments during extrusion. The SEM images of the composites revealed the interaction between the filler and the matrix. Based on the experimental work, it is observed that the addition of eggshell powder into the PLA increases the mechanical properties with an optimum content of 4 wt.% of E.	[Sivagnanamani, G.

Based on the scientific literature, the aim is to provide an updated map of trends and gaps in this relevant research field. Several technologies and investigation methods are examined, thus giving an overview and analysis of the growing body of research. Design/methodology/approach Permutations of keywords, which concern materials, technologies and the accuracy of thermoplastic polymeric parts fabricated by AM, are used for a systematic search in peer-review databases. The selected articles are screened and ranked to identify those that are more relevant. A bibliometric analysis is performed based on investigated materials and applied technologies of published papers. Finally, each paper is categorised and discussed by considering the implemented research methods. Findings The interest in the accuracy of additively manufactured thermoplastics is increasing. The principal sources of inaccuracies are those shrinkages occurring during part solidification. The analysis of the research methods shows a predominance of empirical approaches. Due to the experimental context, those achievements have consequently limited applicability. Analytical and numerical models, which generally require huge computational costs when applied to complex products, are also numerous and are investigated in detail. Several articles deal with artificial intelligence tools and are gaining more and more attention. Originality/value The cross-technology survey on the accuracy issue highlights the common critical aspects of thermoplastics transformed by AM. An updated map of the recent research literature is achieved. The analysis shows the advantages and limitations of different research methods in this field, providing an overview of research trends and gaps.

Recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has been shown to be a robust material for material extrusion additive manufacturing, with mechanical properties comparable with acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene. However, due to PET's high crystallinity, it is generally a brittle material and can be subject to premature fracture. It is well known that the addition of rubbers can serve to toughen PET. In this work, micronized rubber powder, as well as non-reactive and functionalized styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene (SEBS) elastomers were compounded with recycled PET. Tensile strength was not significantly affected, but toughness increased 85% with the addition of 5 wt% rubber, 350% with SEBS and over 550% with maleic anhydride functionalized SEBS compared to neat recycled PET. Fracture surface analysis revealed evidence of ductile fracture and cavitation in the rubber toughened samples. Published 2020.

J	James, S; De La Luz, L				James, Sagil; De La Luz, Lenny			Finite element analysis and simulation study of CFRP/Ti stacks using ultrasonic additive manufacturing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						CFRP; Ultrasonic additive manufacturing; Titanium	MICROSTRUCTURES; BUILDS	The hybrid laminar composite stack of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and titanium (Ti) are widely used in several critical engineering applications, including aerospace and automobile sectors. The joining of CFRP and Ti through conventional methods has several limitations such as weight additional, material damage, and lower fatigue life. Ultrasonic additive manufacturing (UAM) is a solid-state manufacturing process capable of joining layers of dissimilar materials. Experimental studies have successfully demonstrated the welding of CFRP and Ti through UAM process. However, there is a lack of understanding of the exact bonding process and influence of process parameter on weld quality during UAM. The present study investigates the bonding process and the effects of critical parameters in the UAM process of CFRP and Ti layers using finite element analysis and simulation technique. The simulation study reveals that the CFRP/titanium stacks encounter interfacial cyclic shear stresses and shear strains. The study found that the vibrational amplitude and surface roughness of the substrates play a critical role in achieving a proper weld. The simulation results are validated using experimentation. The finding of this study can help advance the commercialization of UAM process for welding dissimilar materials and composites.

Predicting mechanical property plateau in laser polymer powder bed fusion additive manufacturing via the critical coalescence ratio	MATERIALS & DESIGN			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Powder bed fusion; Selective laser sintering; Polymer coalescence; Process parameter prediction; Physical gelation	CRYSTALLIZATION KINETICS; SINTERING REGION; POLYAMIDE 12; SIMULATION; PARAMETERS; RHEOLOGY; DENSITY; MODEL; PARTS; TIME	The state of the art in property-process relationships in the laser polymer powder bed fusion (LPPBF) subcategory of powder bed fusion (PBF) has derived relationships between the energy supplied and polymer thermal properties governing melting and degradation, so-called the "energy melt ratio (EMR)." The EMR provides a framework for process parameter value selection based solely on melting behavior. However, coalescence, and not merely melting, is the basis for mechanical properties in LPPBF printed parts. The authors present a method for (1) predicting polymer coalescence based on transient temperature profiles resulting from a combination of LPPBF process parameter values and (2) connecting the predicted coalescence response to the observed onset of a plateau in mechanical properties. This work tests the hypothesis that the observed onset of a mechanical property plateau corresponds with a transition in consolidation physics. Complete coalescence must be achieved prior to the onset of physical gelation. For this work, in situ transient temperature profiles were obtained using infrared thermography. Coalescence prediction, via the Upper-convected Maxwell model, and physical gelation prediction, via Lauritzen-Hoffman and Avrami equations, were found to successfully identify LPPBF parameter combinations resulting in parts with density and tensile strength inside the plateau region. The hypothesis that the plateau occurs at the onset of closed pore morphology is supported. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It has enabled the processing of many different materials from thermoplast-like polymers to ceramics that have outstanding feature resolutions and surface quality, with comparable properties of traditional materials. This work focuses on the processing of glass ceramics, which have high optical demands, precision and mechanical properties specifically suitable for dental replacements, such as crowns. Lithography-based ceramic manufacturing (LCM) has been chosen as the optimal manufacturing process where a light source with a defined wavelength is used to cure and structure ceramic filled photosensitive resins. In the case of glass ceramic powders, plastic flow during thermal processing might reduce the precision, as well as the commonly observed sintering shrinkage associated with the utilized temperature program. To reduce this problem, particular sinter structures have been developed to optimize the precision of 3D-printed glass ceramic crowns. To evaluate the precision of the final part, testing using digitizing methods from optical to tactile systems were utilized with the best results were obtained from micro computed tomography (CT) scanning. These methods resulted in an optimized process allowing for possible production of high precision molar crowns with dimensional accuracy and high reproducibility.

In this research, a review of large-format AM (LFAM) processes for polymers is presented, followed by market research concerning the identification of large-format polymer commercial printers. An overview was performed covering the current LFAM systems configurations and their control aspects. The design and modelling approaches related with the fabrication of polymer large parts by AM, and the materials currently being applied and under development, were described. Finally, a summary of LFAM applications with a focus in the Transportation, Academic, Construction and Energy sectors, was presented. The current main advances in the LFAM of polymers are linked with the possibility of producing large parts in a faster, cheaper, and reliable way. The market research analysis concerning results for all AM families involving polymer materials reveals that, currently, the material extrusion AM process family is potentially the most suitable to produce large parts, with a significant number of applications attesting its capability to produce such large-format components.

Additive manufacturing in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs): Challenges and potential	AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Review						UAV; 3D printing; Rapid prototyping; Additive manufacturing; Smart materials; Structures; Multi-functional	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; CARBON-FIBER; POLYMER COMPOSITES; SURFACE-ROUGHNESS; LASER; DEPOSITION; STEREOLITHOGRAPHY; FABRICATION; HONEYCOMB; MICROSTRUCTURE	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are gaining popularity due to their application in military, private, and public sector, especially being attractive for fields where human operator is not required. Light-weight UAVs are more desirable as they have better performance in terms of shorter take-off range and longer flight endurance. However, light weight structures with complex inner features are hard to fabricate using conventional manufacturing methods. The ability to print complex inner structures directly without the need of a mould gives additive manufacturing (AM) an edge over conventional manufacturing. Recent development in composite and multi-material printing opens up new possibilities of printing lightweight structures and novel platforms like flapping wings with ease. This paper explores the impact of additive manufacturing on aerodynamics, structures and materials used for UAV5. The review will discuss state-of-the-art AM technologies for UAVs through innovations in materials and structures and their advantages and limitations. The role of additive manufacturing to improve the performance of UAVs through smart material actuators and multi-functional structures will also be discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

J	Kipping, J; Schüppstuhl, T				Kipping, Johann; Schueppstuhl, Thorsten			Load-Oriented Nonplanar Additive Manufacturing Method for Optimized Continuous Carbon Fiber Parts	MATERIALS			English	Article						carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers; nonplanar slicing; additive manufacturing; multi-axis motion; 3D printing; path planning; continuous fiber composites		The process of the additive manufacturing (AM) of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) parts based on the process of fused deposition modeling (FDM) has seen considerable research in recent years, which amplifies the importance of adapted slicing and pathplanning methods. In particular, load-oriented techniques are of high interest when employing carbon fiber materials, as classical methods, such as tape-laying and laminating, struggle with highly curved and complex geometries and require the costly production of molds. While there have been some promising propositions in this field, most have restricted themselves to a planar slicing approach, which severely limits the ability to place the fibers along stress paths. In this paper, a nonplanar slicing approach is presented that utilizes principal stress directions to construct optimized nonplanar constituting layers on which pathplanning can be carried out. These layers are oriented such that the effect of the weak interlayer adhesion is minimized. Support material is adaptively generated to enable the use of arbitrary part geometry. Furthermore, a continuous pathplanning method and post-processor are applied to yield manufacturing instructions. The approach is verified for its viability of application through experimental investigation on a multi-axis robotic 3D printer. This constitutes an important step in allowing the fabrication of CFRP parts to further utilize the possibilities of additive manufacturing.

However, one problem limiting employment of SLS for additive manufacturing in a wide-ranging industrial scope is the narrow variety of applicable polymers. The commonly applied SLS powder to date is polyamide 12 (PA 12). PA 12 or ccompounds of PA 12 (dry blends) are approximately 90 % of complete industrial consumption. The remaining small quantity is distributed on polyamide 11 (PA11) and some other 'exotic' polymers (TPU, PEBA, P(E)EK). Industry is awaiting commodity polymers like polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene (PE) crucial to open new market segments. But several approaches launching those polymers failed. But what are the reasons for the difficulties in developing new SLS powders? The contribution is to answer this and highlights the combination of intrinsic and extrinsic polymer properties necessary to generate a polymer powder promising for SLS application. Particle shape, powder distribution, thermal, theological and optical requirements must be considered and only a particularly controlled property combination leads to successful SLS implementation. Thermal behavior, particle shape and -distribution is discussed in detail, although the other properties can't be disregarded for providing new commercially successful SLS powder finally.

This new technology uses primarily metallic materials like Ti6Al4V or aluminum alloys. The benefits are obvious: Due to the freedom of construction with AM-Technology, there is an enormous potential for mass reduction compared with parts made by traditional processes such as turning or milling. For further mass reduction, however, the use of polymers is becoming more and more in demand. The main challenges with using polymers are low mechanical strength and the outgassing of water and monomers that occurs in space. Metallizing these polymer parts by electroplating increase the mechanical strength of the polymers via the so-called sandwich effect. A dense metallic layer can also prevent the problem of outgassing from occurring. This paper will present the fundamentals of this idea and discuss the metallization of additive manufacturing polymer parts for space applications.

Due to the process influences, the inserted foreign particles were partially ablated by laser input or gas flow. The particles which remained in the final printed specimen's mi-crostructure were analyzed using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed the influence of organic impurities in the Ti-6Al-4V structure. A new phase was formed, which can be distinguished from the surrounding martensitic titanium structure by its own structure and morphology.

A new research direction "bioprocess-inspired fabrication" is proposed to develop novel fabrication techniques for advanced materials. Enamel, an organic-inorganic composite biomaterial with outstanding mechanical performance and durability, is formed by repeating the basic blocks consisting of columnar hydroxyapatite or fluorapatite and an organic matrix. Inspired by the enamel formation process, a microscale additive manufacturing method is proposed for achieving a multilayered organic-inorganic columnar structure. In this approach, rutile titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanorods, polymers, and graphene oxide (GO) are sequentially assembled in a layer-by-layer fashion to form an organic-inorganic structure. In particular, GO serves as a substrate for TiO2 nanorods and interacts with polymers, jointly leading to the strength of the composites. Impressively, this enamel-like structure material has hardness (1.56 +/- 0.05 GPa) and ultrahigh Young's modulus (81.0 +/- 2.7 GPa) comparable to natural enamel, and viscoelastic property (0.76 +/- 0.12 GPa) superior to most solid materials. Consequently, this biomimetic synthetic approach provides an in-depth understanding for the formation process of biomaterials and also enables the exploration of a new avenue for the preparation of organic-inorganic composite materials.

The flexibility of additive manufacturing technologies to fabricate complex geometries from copper, polymer, and ferrous materials presents unique opportunities for new design concepts and improved machine power density without significantly increasing production and prototyping cost. Topology optimization investigates the optimal distribution of single or multiple materials within a defined design space, and can lead to unique geometries not realizable with conventional optimization techniques. As an enabling technology, additive manufacturing provides an opportunity for machine designers to overcome the current manufacturing limitation that inhibit adoption of topology optimization.

Integrating digital image correlation in mechanical testing for the materials characterization of big area additive manufacturing feedstock	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Big area additive manufacturing; Digital image correlation; Materials characterization; Mechanical testing; Polymer matrix composites	COMPOSITES; SYSTEMS; ABS	To enable the advancement of large-scale additive manufacturing processes, it is necessary to establish and standardize methodologies to characterize the mechanical properties of printed test coupons. Due to the large size of the print beads, conventional test standards are inadequate. The focus of this study was to determine the feasibility of using Digital image correlation (DIC) technology as a key enabler for robust data collection of strain measurements of large 3D printed parts. To incorporate the DIC measurements, a novel method was developed to prepare large 20% (by wt.) glass filled ABS test coupons for adequate contrast. Through this technique, Poisson's ratio and elastic modulus were measured and stress strain curves were generated. The data produced by DIC correlated well with failure analysis performed on spent test coupons. Additionally, fracture surface analysis of the specimens revealed poor adhesion among the ABS matrix and glass fibers. This matrix/fiber debonding demonstrated the need for improved printing parameters to maximize tensile strength. Finally, critical length analysis of the fibers revealed them to be dimensionally inadequate.

Among the vast array of techniques developed for the production of tissue-engineering (TE) scaffolds, AM techniques are gaining great interest for their suitability in achieving complex shapes and microstructures with a high degree of automation, good accuracy and reproducibility. In addition, the possibility of rapidly producing tissue-engineered constructs meeting patient's specific requirements, in terms of tissue defect size and geometry as well as autologous biological features, makes them a powerful way of enhancing clinical routine procedures. This paper gives an extensive overview of different AM techniques classes (i.e. stereolithography, selective laser sintering, 3D printing, melt-extrusion-based techniques, solution/slurry extrusion-based techniques, and tissue and organ printing) employed for the development of tissue-engineered constructs made of different materials (i.e. polymeric, ceramic and composite, alone or in combination with bioactive agents), by highlighting their principles and technological solutions.

Using the fused filament fabrication method, the current study investigates the additive manufacturing of hemp-reinforced polybutylene succinate (PBS) alongside its mechanical characterization. Two types of hemp reinforcement are considered: short fibres (max. length smaller than 2 mm) and long fibres (max. length smaller than 10 mm), which are compared against non-reinforced (pure) PBS. A detailed analysis is performed regarding the determination of suitable 3D printing parameters (overlap, temperature, nozzle diameter). In a comprehensive experimental study, additionally to general analyses regarding the influence of hemp reinforcement on the mechanical behaviour, the effect of printing parameters is determined and discussed. Introducing an overlap in the additive manufacturing of the specimens results in improved mechanical performance. The study highlights that the Young's modulus of PBS can be improved by 63% by introducing hemp fibres in conjunction with overlap. In contrast, hemp fibre reinforcement reduces the tensile strength of PBS, while this effect is less pronounced considering overlap in the additive manufacturing process.

J	Dämmer, G; Bauer, H; Neumann, R; Major, Z				Daemmer, Gabriel; Bauer, Hartmut; Neumann, Ruediger; Major, Zoltan			Design, additive manufacturing and component testing of pneumatic rotary vane actuators for lightweight robots	RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL			English	Article						Actuators; Functional testing; Moulding; Polymers; Robotics; Additive manufacturing	SOFT; PARTS; MODEL	Purpose This study aims to investigate the suitability of a multi-step prototyping strategy for producing pneumatic rotary vane actuators (RVAs) for the development of lightweight robots and actuation systems. Design/methodology/approach RVAs typically have cast aluminum housings and injection-molded seals that consist of hard thermoplastic cores and soft elastomeric overmolds. Using a combination of additive manufacturing (AM), computer numerical control (CNC) machining and elastomer molding, a conventionally manufactured standard RVA was replicated. The standard housing design was modified, and polymeric replicas were obtained by selective laser sintering (SLS) or PolyJet (PJ) printing and subsequent CNC milling. Using laser-sintered molds, actuator seals were replicated by overmolding laser-sintered polyamide cores with silicone (SIL) and polyurethane (PU) elastomers. The replica RVAs were subjected to a series of leakage, friction and durability experiments. Findings The AM-based prototyping strategy described is suitable for producing functional and reliable RVAs for research and product development. In a representative durability experiment, the RVAs in this study endured between 40,000 and 1,000,000 load cycles. Frictional torques were around 0.5 Nm, which is 10% of the theoretical torque at 6 bar and comparable to that of the standard RVA. Models and parameters are provided for describing the velocity-dependent frictional torque. Leakage experiments at 10,000 load cycles and 6 bar differential pressure showed that PJ housings exhibit lower leakage values (6.8 L/min) than laser-sintered housings (15.2 L/min), and PU seals exhibit lower values (8.0 l/min) than SIL seals (14.0 L/min). Combining PU seals with PJ housings led to an initial leakage of 0.4 L/min, which increased to only 1.2 L/min after 10,000 load cycles. Overall, the PU material used was more difficult to process but also more abrasion- and tear-resistant than the SIL elastomer. Research limitations/implications More work is needed to understand individual cause-effect relationships between specific design features and system behavior. Originality/value To date, pneumatic RVAs have been manufactured by large-scale production technologies. The absence of suitable prototyping strategies has limited the available range to fixed sizes and has thus complicated the use of RVAs in research and product development. This paper proves that functional pneumatic RVAs can be produced by using more accessible manufacturing technologies and provides the tools for prototyping of application-specific RVAs.

Characterization of Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) and Ag-Carbon Black TPU Nanocomposite for Potential Application in Additive Manufacturing	POLYMERS			English	Article						thermoplastic polyurethane; nanocomposite; compression; electromechanical response; viscoelasticity; adhesion; chain relaxation/ordering; additive manufacturing	BEHAVIOR; MECHANISMS; ADHESION	Electromechanical, adhesion, and viscoelastic properties of polymers and polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) are of interest for additive manufacturing (AM) and flexible electronics. Development/optimization of inks for AM is complex, expensive, and substrate/interface dependent. This study investigates properties of free standing films of a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) polymer and an Ag-carbon black (Ag-CB) TPU PNC in a lightly loaded low strain compression contact as a rough measure of their suitability for AM. The TPU exhibited high hysteresis and a large viscoelastic response, and sufficient dwell time was needed for polymer chain relaxation and measurable adhesion. A new discovery is that large enough contact area is needed to allow longer time constant polymer ordering in the contact that led to higher adhesion and better performance/reliability. This has previously unknown implications for interface size relative to polymer chain length in AM design. The standard linear model was found to be a good fit for the viscoelastic behavior of the TPU. The PNC exhibited no adhesion (new result), low electrical resistance, and relatively small viscoelastic response. This implies potential for AM electrical trace as well as switch applications.

Membranes for water treatment experienced significant breakthroughs owing to the unique benefits of additive manufacturing. In particular, 3D printing's high degree of freedom in various aspects such as material and prototype design has helped to fabricate innovative spacers and membranes. However, there were conflicting reports on the feasibility of 3D printing, especially for membranes. Some research groups stated that technology limitations today made it impossible to 3D print membranes, but others showed that it was possible by successfully fabricating prototypes. This paper will provide a critical and comprehensive discussion on 3D printing specifically for spacers and membranes. Various 3D printing techniques will be introduced, and their suitability for membrane and spacer fabrication will be discussed. It will be followed by a review of past studies associated with 3D-printed spacers and membranes. A new category of additive manufacturing in the membrane water industry will be introduced here, known as hybrid additive manufacturing, to address the controversies of 3D printing for membrane. As AM technology continues to advance, its possibilities in the water treatment is limitless. Some insightful future trends will be provided at the end of the paper. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Hence, there is a necessity for the design and production of smart and multi-functional tools, which combine several cutting-edge technologies, including additive manufacturing and smart control systems. In the current article, a novel multi-functional biomimetic soft actuator with a pneumatic motion system was designed and fabricated by combining different additive manufacturing techniques. The developed actuator was bioinspired by the natural kinematics, namely the motion mechanism of worms, and was designed to imitate the movement of a human finger. Furthermore, due to its modular design and the ability to adapt the actuator's external covers depending on the requested task, this actuator is suitable for a wide range of applications, from soft (i.e., fruit grasping) or industrial grippers to medical exoskeletons for patients with mobility difficulties and neurological disorders. In detail, the motion system operates with two pneumatic chambers bonded to each other and fabricated from silicone rubber compounds molded with additively manufactured dies made of polymers. Moreover, the pneumatic system offers multiple-degrees-of-freedom motion and it is capable of bending in the range of -180 degrees to 180 degrees. The overall pneumatic system is protected by external covers made of 3D printed components whose material could be changed from rigid polymer for industrial applications to thermoplastic elastomer for complete soft robotic applications. In addition, these 3D printed parts control the angular range of the actuator in order to avoid the reaching of extreme configurations. Finally, the bio-robotic actuator is electronically controlled by PID controllers and its real-time position is monitored by a one-axis soft flex sensor which is embedded in the actuator's configuration.

The effectiveness of a PCM is defined by its energy and power density-the total available storage capacity (kWh m(-3)) and how fast it can be accessed (kW m(-3)). These are influenced by both material properties as well as geometry of the energy systems; however, prior efforts have primarily focused on improving material properties, namely, maximizing latent heat of fusion and increasing thermal conductivity. The latter is often at the expense of the former. Advanced manufacturing techniques hold tremendous potential to enable co-optimization of material properties and device geometry, while potentially reducing material waste and manufacturing time. There is an emerging body of research focused on additive manufacturing of PCM composites and devices for thermal energy storage (TES) and thermal management. In this article, the fundamentals and applications of PCMs are reviewed and recent additive manufacturing advances in latent heat TES for both the PCM composite and associated heat exchanger are discussed. A forward-looking perspective on the future and potential of PCM additive manufacturing for TES and thermal management is provided.	[Freeman, Thomas B.; Foster, Kyle E.

There are two types of gradient structures observed in the PA12 parts. One of the gradient structures is found in the topmost layer, where the total crystallinity drops gradually from the free surface to the core region further to the weld region. Moreover, the coexistence of alpha and gamma crystals is found in all regions. The gradient structure in the topmost layer arises from partial melting and chain relaxation occurring during the welding of the free surfaces between adjacent layers. Another gradient structure is that the crystallinity in PA12 parts demonstrates a gradual variation with decreasing the distance from the deposited layer to the platform, especially at a platform temperature above 60 degrees C. Specifically, the bottom layer has much higher crystallinity than the top layer, with the middle layer in between, since the annealing effect of the hot platform gradually weakens from bottom to top due to the low heat conduction of PA12. This work provides a detailed insight into the crystallization mechanism of polyamide materials during MEAM process, which is meaningful for the manipulation of crystal structures in MEAM-printed semicrystalline polymers.

Accelerating heat transfer modeling in material extrusion additive manufacturing: From desktop to big area	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Material extrusion; Big area additive manufacturing; Finite volume; Heat transfer; Radiation effects	FUSED-FILAMENT-FABRICATION; CONTACT PRESSURE; MELT EXTRUSION; POLYMER; DEPOSITION; FLOW; TEMPERATURE; STRENGTH; VALIDATION; SIMULATION	Thermal modeling informs the understanding of cooling phenomena and structural evolution during material extrusion (MatEx) additive manufacturing to help predict and tune final part properties. For fused filament fabrication (FFF) and big area additive manufacturing (BAAM), in particular, thermal models are well-suited to augment parameter optimization and closed-loop control for high throughput manufacturing of custom parts and products. However, limitations in computational time, speed, and cost pose a challenge to modeling large structures with sufficient multi-dimensional granularity over extended timescales, with many models confined either to high-resolution studies on short length and timescales or low-resolution, lumped approximations for larger timescale simulations. Thus, the goal of this work is to develop a high-fidelity thermal model applicable from desktop to BAAM systems with minimal computational constraint. Here we present a scalable, 2D finite volume "proof-of-concept " model and algorithm to rapidly simulate thermal histories across both FFF and BAAM length and time scales. Our approach implements a two-dimensional implicit numerical strategy that confers reduced computational complexity while offering fine scale granularity in capturing critical inter- and intralayer cooling dynamics and radiative heat transfer. Further, analysis of the effective Biot number (Bi) reveals that, on the BAAM scale, layer width and radiative heat transfer both drive the formation of intralayer temperature gradients, exceeding 51 degrees C between the layer center and edge. We further simulate the fabrication of single road-width acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) walls at the BAAM scale (50 layers) to demonstrate both the relative speed of the computational approach and its ability to capture the complex dynamics of a multilayer build. The model agrees with published experimental measurements, and results gauge the influence of layer thickness and proximity to print bed on cooling behavior, with larger layers and separation from the print bed lending to longer periods for interlayer welds to form above the ABS glass transition temperature (T-g). Finally, a BAAM case study highlights the model's utility in design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) and print optimization, demonstrating how changes in bed temperature and layer time can impact interlayer bonding.

While FFF machines are fed with expensive and few commercially available filament feedstock, Freeformer is fed with cheap and common polymer pellets. In this study, more than 400 dumbbells made of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) were processed varying many processing conditions to evaluate their impacts on the structure and so on, the mechanical properties of 3D parts. Among processing parameter, nozzle temperature, manufacturing chamber temperature, discharge parameters, filling density, raster geometry, slicing distance, number of contour lines, processing speed, filling raster-contour lines overlap, and processing angles were studied. Images obtained with a scanning electron microscope and 3D part density estimations reveal strong changes on the 3D part structure as a function of the processing parameters so that tensile tests exhibit high variations between the 3D part mechanical properties.

The parts are built up layer by layer. Unlike polymer binding with glass particles with its sintering process no secondary step is necessary for polymer printing to create the final part. With more and more printers and transparent materials available, this technology becomes more and more relevant for prototyping or custom optics. Therefor a deep understanding of the optical effects in the part is desirable. Key property of optical elements is the refractive index. The materials for polymer printing are most commonly resins that cure under UV-exposure and show lower refractive indices in liquid phase than cured. Assuming a dependency of the refractive index on the grade of polymerization and therefor the UV-exposure, the layering process of additive manufacturing causes variations of the refractive index within the part. Using the Scanning Focused Refractive Index Microscopy, the distribution of the refractive index within and between the layers is analyzed. The analysis includes comparisons between raw parts after printing and parts after UV post curing. Additionally, layer free samples from a Continuous Liquid Interface Printing System are examined for the homogeneity of the refractive index distribution. The purpose of the presentation is to give a detailed insight into the optical effects occurring at the layer interfaces of elements created by additive manufacturing. Possible use cases of the refractive index distributions within the part are also discussed.

Material and methods A complete edentulous maxillary cast with 6 implant replicas was prepared. The definitive cast was duplicated using two manufacturing procedures namely conventional (CNV group) and additive manufacturing procedures (AM group). On the CNV, an AM Co-Cr framework and a custom AM custom tray with a polyether impression material were used to obtain an impression of the definitive cast at room temperature (23 degrees C). On the AM group, the definitive cast was digitized using a laboratory scanner. The standard tessellation language (STL) file was exported and used to manufacture the polymeric AM specimens using a multijet printer following manufacturer ' s recommendations. A new digital implant replica was located on each corresponding housing of each AM specimen. A total of 10 specimens per group was obtained. A CMM was selected to measure the position of each implant replica on the definitive cast, CNV, and AM specimens. Linear and angular discrepancies were computed for each specimen. Thus, the Mann Whitney U test was used to analyze the data (p = 0.05). Results There was no significant difference in x-, y-, and z- linear and XZ angular discrepancy between both groups. However, the AM group revealed a significantly higher median YZ angular discrepancy than the CNV group (p = 0.007). Conclusions Material jetting AM technology demonstrated no significant difference in trueness and precision values of the linear and angular implant replica positions when compared to the conventional technique.

New possibilities using additive manufacturing with materials that are difficult to process and with complex structures	PHYSICA SCRIPTA			English	Article						additive manufacturing; materials; 3D printing; composites	3D; ARCHITECTURES	Additive manufacturing (or 3D printing) opens the possibility of creating new designs and manufacturing objects with new materials rapidly and economically. Particularly for use with polymers and polymer composites, simple printers can make high quality products, and these can be produced easily in offices, schools and in workshops and laboratories. This technology has opened a route for many to test ideas or to make custom devices. It is possible to easily manufacture complex geometries that would be difficult or even impossible to create with traditional methods. Naturally this technology has attracted attention in many fields that include the production of medical devices and prostheses, mechanical engineering as well as basic sciences. Materials that are highly problematic to machine can be used. We illustrate process developments with an account of the production of printer parts to cope with polymer fillers that are hard and abrasive; new nozzles with ruby inserts designed for such materials are durable and can be used to print boron carbide composites. As with other materials, complex parts can be printed using boron carbide composites with fine structures, such as screw threads and labels to identify materials. General ideas about design for this new era of manufacturing customised parts are presented.

Due to their monolithic nature, electroactive polypyrrole films produced via this process are typically limited to simple linear or bending actuation modes, which has hindered their application in complex actuation tasks. This initiative aims to develop the specialized fabrication methods and polymer formulations required to realize three-dimensional conductive polymer structures capable of more elaborate actuation modes. Our group has previously reported the application of the digital light processing additive manufacturing process for the fabrication of three-dimensional conductive polymer structures using ultraviolet radiation. In this investigation, we further expand upon this initial work and present an improved polymer formulation designed for digital light processing additive manufacturing using visible light. This technology enables the design of novel electroactive polymer sensors and actuators with enhanced capabilities and brings us one step closer to realizing more advanced electroactive polymer enabled devices.

The intent is to optimize it to an upcoming source for additive manufacturing by modulating its behavior using a chain extender triphenyl phosphite (TPP), nanofiller montmorillonite (MMT K-10), and catalyst antimony trioxide (Sb2O3). FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared) analysis showed an increase in absorbance due to the Sb2O3. The thermal analysis of the rPET using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) ascertains a 10 degrees C decrease in T-g with a substantial increase in the degradation onset of 7 degrees C due to MMT content. The melt flow index (MFI) study showed an increase with a similar range in intrinsic viscosity and weight average molecular weight (M-w) due to the additives. The percentage crystallinity, interlayer distance, and average crystallite size are determined and analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and DSC curves. The results are within the comparative range of both tests. The presence of Sb2O3 with higher MMT content showed agglomeration, and increased TPP showed low crystalline properties. These results provide that rPET can be altered to manufacture feedstock to suit different 3D printing techniques for prototyping.

J	Shi, Y; Faludi, J				Shi, Yuan; Faludi, Jeremy			Using life cycle assessment to determine if high utilization is the dominant force for sustainable polymer additive manufacturing	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Sustainable additive manufacturing; Green 3D printing; Environmental impacts; Life cycle assessment; Energy efficiency	ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; EMISSIONS; PRINTER	Previous studies on the environmental impacts of polymeric additive manufacturing (AM) have shown that higher printer utilization dramatically improves impacts per part-so much so that it might dominate all other interventions if taken to an extreme. High utilization can be both temporal (printing constantly) and spatial (printing many parts at once). In this study, life cycle assessments (LCAs) were performed for an inkjet fusion printer with exceptionally high spatial utilization capacity and were compared to previous LCAs of nine printers printing with eight materials. Comparisons were performed in different utilizations, both temporal and spatial, to determine if high utilization reduces the environmental impact of AM more than other interventions, such as using sustainable print materials. For the inkjet fusion printer, maximum utilization dramatically reduced the environmental impact per part to less than 1% of its impact in lowest utilization; this was below the impacts of other printers in low utilizations. However, when compared in the same utilization scenarios, the inkjet fusion printer still caused a higher environmental impact per part than almost all printers, primarily due to high energy use. The lowest-impact printer used both high spatial utilization and low-impact materials that also enabled a low-energy printing process. Therefore, printer utilization is not the overriding factor and must be combined with energy efficiency and material choice.

To better understand impregnation with high-viscosity polymer melts, a 1D version of Darcy?s Law is derived along with Gebart?s equations for estimating fiber tow impregnation and permeability. Rheology of the two polymer melts tested, nylon 6/12 and polycarbonate, were measured using a capillary viscometer. The experimental setup consisted of a heated and weighted plunger system to maintain polymer melt pressure in a temperature-controlled pultrusion chamber, through which a dry 3 K carbon fiber tow passes through at a constant velocity for in situ impregnation. The resulting TPC tape was collected on a reel and not used directly for AM. The setup allowed three process variables in Darcy?s equation, i.e. chamber pressure, polymer viscosity (via temperature), and exposure time, to be varied. The degree of impregnation of the thick tape specimens ? quantified using digital microscopy and image analysis on polished cross-sections ? matched theoretical predictions quite well (average errors of -10% for nylon and -15% for polycarbonate). However, despite pressures up to 1.2 MPa and exposure times (5.5-15 sec) consistent with current AM system feed rates, the extremely high melt viscosities (290?980 Pa?sec) make full impregnation of thick tapes nearly impossible in a practical setting. Improvements to the in situ impregnation process based on experimental results and impregnation models are suggested.

This method features in modeling the process-induced material anisotropy through microscopic geometric modeling obtained by scanning electron micrographs. Numerical homogenization is performed to evaluate the equivalent effective properties of the 100-percentage cross-infilled local microstructures, and by introducing fitting functions, the relationship between equivalent effective material properties and varying cross-infill angles is empirically constructed. Then, optimization problems involving cross-infill angles as design variables are formulated, including concurrent optimization formulation. Numerical and experimental studies are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Both the numerical and experimental results demonstrate that the structural stiffness obtained by our proposed method has evidently improved.

Irreversible thermal strain, which is a measurement of shape transformation upon annealing, is shown to depend on both raster angle and layer thickness, both of which are parameters than can be easily adjusted on most FFF printers. We present an algorithm based on our understanding of the underlying micromechanics of the system that allows for input of desired final dimensions and output the necessary print parameters. We also demonstrate that this approach is extensible to other materials and report more complex shape memory geometries. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2019, 136, 48239.

Large-scale additive manufacturing with bioinspired cellulosic materials	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CHITOSAN; CHITIN; COMPOSITE; STRENGTH	Cellulose is the most abundant and broadly distributed organic compound and industrial by-product on Earth. However, despite decades of extensive research, the bottom-up use of cellulose to fabricate 3D objects is still plagued with problems that restrict its practical applications: derivatives with vast polluting effects, use in combination with plastics, lack of scalability and high production cost. Here we demonstrate the general use of cellulose to manufacture large 3D objects. Our approach diverges from the common association of cellulose with green plants and it is inspired by the wall of the fungus-like oomycetes, which is reproduced introducing small amounts of chitin between cellulose fibers. The resulting fungal-like adhesive material(s) (FLAM) are strong, lightweight and inexpensive, and can be molded or processed using woodworking techniques. We believe this first large-scale additive manufacture with ubiquitous biological polymers will be the catalyst for the transition to environmentally benign and circular manufacturing models.

Hybrid additive manufacturing of 3D electronic systems	JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING			English	Article						3D printing; hybrid additive manufacturing; 3D electronic systems; digital light projection stereolithography (DLP SL); 3D micro-dispensing	FREEFORM FABRICATION	A novel hybrid additive manufacturing (AM) technology combining digital light projection (DLP) stereolithography (SL) with 3D micro-dispensing alongside conventional surface mount packaging is presented in this work. This technology overcomes the inherent limitations of individual AM processes and integrates seamlessly with conventional packaging processes to enable the deposition of multiple materials. This facilitates the creation of bespoke end-use products with complex 3D geometry and multi-layer embedded electronic systems. Through a combination of four-point probe measurement and non-contact focus variation microscopy, it was identified that there was no obvious adverse effect of DLP SL embedding process on the electrical conductivity of printed conductors. The resistivity maintained to be less than 4 x 10(-4) Omega . cm before and after DLP SL embedding when cured at 100 degrees C for 1 h. The mechanical strength of SL specimens with thick polymerized layers was also identified through tensile testing. It was found that the polymerization thickness should be minimised (less than 2 mm) to maximise the bonding strength. As a demonstrator a polymer pyramid with embedded triple-layer 555 LED blinking circuitry was successfully fabricated to prove the technical viability.	[Li, J.; Wasley, T.; Nguyen, T.

The ability to design and print virtually any object shape using a diverse array of materials, such as metals, polymers, ceramics and bioinks, has allowed for the adoption of this technology for biomedical applications in both research and clinical settings. Current advancements in tissue engineering and regeneration, therapeutic delivery, medical device fabrication and operative management planning ensure that AM will continue to play an increasingly important role in the future of healthcare.

In this study, the mechanical properties and macrostructural crushing behaviour of five additively manufactured polymer-based honeycomb structures (HS) are investigated. Subjected to in-plane loading, the experimental results of the HS are compared with numerical findings and theoretical predictions. Results indicate that deformation modes and overall crushing performance are influenced by utilising different parent materials. The polymer HS made from polyethylene terephthalate glycol gives the best overall crushing performance over the other polymers and polymer-fibre reinforcement HS. However, the crush force efficiency of HS made from polylactic acid is the least promising. The polymer-fibre reinforced HS outperforms some of the pure polymer-based ones in terms of specific energy absorption and shows a characteristic lightweight advantage. Hence, spotting it as a promising energy absorber utilised for crashworthiness application especially where ultra-lightweight property is highly desired.

The project focused on a Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning application and used an industry-standard copper/aluminum heat exchanger manufactured with conventional technology as the basis for assessing performance. The manufacturing constraints associated with using deposition-based AM technology for this application include the need for a continuous tool path within each build layer that allows uninterrupted extrusion and therefore defect-free water channel walls that correspond to a reliably leak-tight heat exchanger. A geometry that respects these constraints was developed, simulated, optimized and finally manufactured and tested. The material used was a composite of polymer filled with conductive flakes in order to provide high conductivity in the direction that heat must flow in this heat exchanger, across the wall separating the fluids. The measured performance for several test coupons matched the predicted performance and the test coupons exhibited performance that approach and in some cases exceeds conventional technology	[Boxleitner, Jake] Brayton Energy, 75B Lafayette Rd, Hampton, NH 03842 USA; [Mulholland, Tom] Essentium Inc, 19025 North,Heatherwilde Blvd Suite 100, Pflugerville, TX 78660 USA; [Nellis, Gregory] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Mech Engn, 1500 Engn Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA	University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison	Boxleitner, J (corresponding author), Brayton Energy, 75B Lafayette Rd, Hampton, NH 03842 USA.	jake.boxleitner@braytonenergy.com; tom.mulholland@essentium.com; gfnellis@engrwisc.edu			Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), U.S. Department of Energy [DE-AR0000573]	Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))	The information, data, or work presented herein was funded in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), U.S. Department of Energy, under Award Number DE-AR0000573.

J	Curto, M; Kao, AP; Keeble, W; Tozzi, G; Barber, AH				Curto, M.; Kao, A. P.; Keeble, W.; Tozzi, G.; Barber, A. H.			X-ray computed tomography evaluations of additive manufactured multimaterial composites	JOURNAL OF MICROSCOPY			English	Article						3D printing; additive manufacturing; composites; multimaterial; X-ray computed tomography	REINFORCED COMPOSITES; 3D; SCAFFOLD	Additive Manufacturing (AM) often produces complex engineered structures by precisely distributing materials in a layer-by-layer fashion. Multimaterial AM is a particularly flexible technique able to combine a range of hard and soft materials to produce designed composites. Critically, the design of AM multimaterial structures requires the development of precise three-dimensional (3D) computed aided design (CAD) files. While such digital design is heavily used, techniques able to validate the physically manufactured composite against the digital design from which it is generated are lacking for AM, especially as any evaluations must be able to distinguish material variation across the 3D space. Nowadays, there is a growing interest in volumetric tools that can provide topological information hidden by the surface of shaped materials. So far, technologies such as Optical microscopy (OM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) have paved the way into the metrology field to measure the external geometry of physical objects. Currently, alongside conventional metrology tools, X-ray computed tomography (XCT) is emerging to measure the subsurface of the objects but maintaining the integrity of the probed samples. Thereby, the volumetric nature of the XCT investigations and its associated imaging techniques, ensure 3D quantitative measurements comparable to the output data from 2D metrology tools, but above all, supply the missing subsurface description for an exhaustive metrology study. The reward associated with XCT applied to multimaterial AM is a map reflecting the fabricated distribution of materials following CAD, with the benefits of better understanding the mechanical interplay within phases, hence, describing the hidden processes as well as the changes in phases due to a range of mechanical or chemical phenomena. In this study, a nondestructive approach using X-ray computed tomography (XCT) is used to fully evaluate the 3D distribution of multimaterials from an AM process. Specifically, two diverse hard and soft materials are alternatively produced in the form of a fibre embedded in a matrix via ink-jet printing. XCT coupled with imaging evaluation were able to distinguish between the differing materials and, importantly, to demonstrate a reduction in the expected fabricated volumes when compared to the respective CAD designs. Lay description Additive Manufacturing (AM) has recently become important in producing complex engineered structures. Using 3D CAD files and/or reconstructed data sets from imaging, hard and soft materials are manufactured independently or in combination, according to geometrical features and shapes in the input data. However, the evaluation of the resultant manufactured parts in comparison with the original 3D drawing is currently lacking. In this sense, X-ray computed tomography (XCT) provides an important metrology tool for mono and multimaterial AM. In this work a volumetric metrology investigation is proposed using higher resolution XCT to provide 3D information comparable to that of the 3D CAD drawings. A commercial high-resolution multijetting material printer (ProJet 5500X, 3D Systems, USA) is used to manufacture single fibre composites, through a complementary deposition of photo sensible polymers. Hard and soft plastics are produced using a UV curable step, resulting in materials of similar attenuation under an X-ray probe. A critical aim of the evaluations is the potential for XCT to distinguish between different UV curable 3D printing materials.	[Curto, M.; Kao, A.

Compared with conventional manufacturing processes for CFRP, additive manufacturing (AM) can facilitate the fabrication of CFRP components with complex structures. While AM offers significant advantages over conventional processes, establishing the structure-property relationships in additively manufactured CFRP remains a challenge because the mechanical properties of additively manufactured CFRP depend on many design parameters. To address this issue, we introduce a data-driven modeling approach that predicts the flexural strength of continuous carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CCFRP) fabricated by fused deposition modeling (FDM). The predictive model of flexural strength is trained using machine learning and validated on experimental data. The relationship between three structural design factors, including the number of fiber layers, the number of fiber rings as well as polymer infill patterns, and the flexural strength of the CCFRP specimens is quantified.

In this work, we explored a fabrication route using a FFF filament filled with 316 L steel powder at 55 vol.-%. We investigated the printing, debinding and sintering parameters and optimized them with respect to the mechanical properties of the final part. Special focus was placed on debinding and sintering in order to obtain components of low residual porosity. Solvent debinding of the printed green bodies created an internal network of interconnected pores and was followed by thermal debinding. Thermal debinding allowed for complete removal of the remaining binder and produced mechanically stable brown parts. Sintering at 1360 degrees C provided densification of the parts and generated nearly isotropic linear shrinkage of about 20%. Using optimized parameters, it was possible to fabricate 316 L steel components with a density greater than 95% via the material extrusion additive manufacturing, debinding and sintering route, with achievable deflections in a 3-point bending test similar to rolled sheet material, albeit at lower strength.

J	Afshar, A; Wood, R				Afshar, Arash; Wood, Roy			Development of Weather-Resistant 3D Printed Structures by Multi-Material Additive Manufacturing	JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES SCIENCE			English	Article						3D printed coating; multi-material additive manufacturing; environmental exposure; ABS; ASA	EPOXY; PHOTODEGRADATION; TEMPERATURE; MOISTURE; RESINS	Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, has had a big impact on the manufacturing world through its low cost, material recyclability, and fabrication of intricate geometries with a high resolution. Three-dimensionally printed polymer structures in aerospace, marine, construction, and automotive industries are usually intended for service in outdoor environments. During long-term exposures to harsh environmental conditions, the mechanical properties of these structures can be degraded significantly. Developing coating systems for 3D printed parts that protect the structural surface against environmental effects and provide desired surface properties is crucial for the long-term integrity of these structures. In this study, a novel method was presented to create 3D printed structures coated with a weather-resistant material in a single manufacturing operation using multi-material additive manufacturing. One group of specimens was 3D printed from acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) material and the other group was printed from ABS and acrylic-styrene-acrylonitrile (ASA) as a substrate and coating material, respectively. The uncoated ABS specimens suffered significant degradation in the mechanical properties, particularly in the failure strain and toughness, during exposure to UV radiation, moisture, and high temperature. However, the ASA coating preserved the mechanical properties and structural integrity of ABS 3D printed structures in aggressive environments.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard test artifact contains a collection of various features that can be used to characterize a 3D printer's performance and has been used to benchmark metal printers. There is limited documentation on how well different additive manufacturing processes can fabricate the NIST artifact. This dataset records the dimensional uncertainty of selective printed features of the NIST artifact manufactured with polymer and resin printing processes. It contains the post-processing dimensional measurements of geometric features on the printed test artifacts. In order to generate the data, a total of 16 samples of the test artifact were printed with fused deposition modelling (FDM) and stereolithography (SLA) additive manufacturing methods. The percentage error between the measurement of features in the printed samples and their nominal computer aided design (CAD) values are calculated. For future reusability of this data, the same NIST test artifact CAD model can be printed, and the features' measurements can be compared with the dataset presented in this article.

J	Austin, B; Cheer, J				Austin, Beth; Cheer, Jordan			Realisation of acoustic black holes using multi-material additive manufacturing	FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS			English	Article						acoustic black holes; additive manufacturing; inkjet printing; passive vibration control; multi material 3D printing	REFLECTION	Acoustic black holes (ABHs) have been widely accepted as an effective passive vibration control technique, with multiple configurations investigated for different applications. However, traditional manufacturing techniques may limit the potential geometries and configurations of the ABH. For example, the required damping layer has to be applied to the surface of the ABH taper rather than being embedded throughout or within the taper. In addition, conventional subtractive manufacturing is particularly wasteful for the realisation of ABHs, which rely on the removal of material to create a tapering structure. Therefore, in this work, we investigate the use of multi-material additive manufacturing as a potential solution, which avoids waste material in the manufacturing process and is capable of realising complex geometries, such as enclosing one material inside another. An ABH taper in a beam termination application has been implemented using polymer multi-material inkjet printing. The additively manufactured ABH was modelled using finite element analysis, before being manufactured and experimentally tested to enable an investigation of the vibration attenuation capabilities of such an ABH realisation.

Bulk-Material Bond Strength Exists in Extrusion Additive Manufacturing for a Wide Range of Temperatures, Speeds, and Layer Times	3D PRINTING AND ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						additive manufacturing; interface strength; extrusion temperature; printing speed; cooling time	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; POLYMERS; TENSILE; CHALLENGES; RESISTANCE; BEHAVIOR; FRACTURE; PARTS	Do extrusion temperature, printing speed, and layer time affect mechanical performance of interlayer bonds in material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEAM)? The question is one of the main challenges in 3D printing of polymers. This article aims to analyze the independent effect of printing parameters on interlayer bonding in MEAM. In previous research, printing parameters were unavoidably interrelated, such as printing speed and layer cooling time. Here, original specimen designs allow the effects to be studied independently for the first time to provide new understanding of the effects of a wide range of thermal factors on mechanical properties of 3D-printed polylactide. The experimental approach used direct GCode design to manufacture specially designed single-filament-thick specimens for tensile testing to measure mechanical and thermal properties normal to the interface between layers. In total, five different extrusion temperatures (a range of 60 degrees C), five different printing speeds (a 16-fold change in the magnitude) and four different layer times (an 8-fold change) were independently studied. The results demonstrate interlayer bond strength to be equivalent to that of the bulk material within experimental scatter. This study provides strong evidence about the crucial role of microscale geometry for apparent interlayer bond strength relative to the role of thermal factors. By designing specimens specifically for the MEAM process, this study clearly demonstrates that bulk-material strength can be achieved for interlayer bonds in MEAM even when printing parameters change severalfold. Widespread industrial and academic efforts to improve interlayer bonding should be refocused to study extrusion geometry-the primary cause of anisotropy in MEAM.

Polyurethane/polylactide (TPU/PLA) is chosen as the matrix material, and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) acts as the filler. Although the loading of h-BN is fixed at 30 wt%, the TC values can shift from 0.63 to 1.80 W m K, which shows the importance of processing control. The influences of filler size, filler system, and process strategy are discussed systematically. This work provides some new ideas in preparing high TC polymer composite. The sample can be potentially utilized at some conditions which need rapid prototyping, good thermal conductivity, and good ductility.

With unique mechanical, thermal, electrical, biocompatible and fire-retardant properties, polymeric composite materials for powder-based AM have been attracting intensive research interests because of their potential for a wide variety of functional applications in aerospace, automobile, marine and offshore, medical and many other industries. This article provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on polymeric composite materials, their powder preparation for AM, and functionalities and applications of their printed products. It begins with the introduction of thermoplastic polymers that have been used as the main matrices of the polymeric composites and various composite reinforcements such as metallic, ceramic, carbon-based fillers and polymer blends for strengthening and functionality purposes. Discussion is then made on the processes for manufacturing such polymeric composites into powder form, which include shear pulverization, solution-based methods and melt compounding methods, with a focus on their advantages, limitations and challenges in terms of their productivity and processibility as well as powder printability. Thereafter, the properties and functionalities of the printed products and their various intriguing applications particularly in biomedical (anatomical models, tissue engineering and drug delivery), aerospace, automobile, military, energy and environmental, acoustic devices and sports equipment are highlighted. Finally, this review is concluded with an outlook on polymeric composites for powder-based AM, new opportunities, major challenges and possible solutions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The concept behind this work is to additively develop a flexible surface acoustic wave (SAW) device with enhanced electromechanical properties capable of detecting mechanical strain occurring in aerospace applications. The nanocomposite substrate is made of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) owing to its flexibility, piezoelectricity, long-term stability, and easy processing incorporated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as nanofillers. Adding CNTs to the polymer matrix for electromechanical properties enhancement is investigated through additive manufacturing (AM) process. Both the thin substrate and the interdigital transducer (IDT) are fabricated through direct digital manufacturing (DDM), exhibiting favorable piezoelectric and electrical properties. Various device characteristics of fabricated SAW sensor, including the generation and propagation of Rayleigh waves and the changes in wave characteristics, such as frequency, admittance, and impedance, are discussed in this paper. The effects of IDT dimensions and the resonant frequency response of the developed SAW device are also examined with numerical analysis.

However, this technology has its limitations. One such limitation is the inability to print components larger than the printer's size due to the limited size of the build chamber. 4D additive manufacturing or 4D printing is an innovative development based on 3D printing that allows objects to be reshaped after printing, using stimuli-responsive materials that require external stimuli. This article present a review on 4D printing. Four databases, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus database, were systematically searched for relevant review articles to identify and classify research studies. Specific keywords (4D printing, additive manufacturing, smart materials, stimuli, and application) were identified and used to guide the discovery of relevant studies. A total of 28 full articles were reviewed to study the applications of 4D printing, smart materials for 4D printing, as well as the effect of various stimuli on 4D printed objects. In conclusion, this review gives a summary of 4D printing and highlights its potential for revolutionizing manufacturing and further research is required to solve the limitations posed by this technology.

J	Zawaski, C; Williams, C				Zawaski, Callie; Williams, Christopher			Design of a low-cost, high-temperature inverted build environment to enable desktop-scale additive manufacturing of performance polymers	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Material extrusion; Fused filament fabrication; High-performance polymers; Heated build chamber	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; PRE-DEPOSITION; EXTRUSION	A heated build environment in Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing (AM) is used to promote layer bonding in printed parts and reduce the difference in temperature between the extrusion and environment decreasing the shrinkage, residual stresses, and part deformation. A build environment capable of maintaining a high-temperature (> 200 degrees C) is often required to enable high-quality FFF printing of high-glass-transition, high-performance polymers such as nylon, PPSF, and ULTEM. Industrial-scale AM systems are capable of printing such polymers, as they offer a controlled, high-temperature printing environment; however, the machine cost often exceeds > $100,000. High-temperature printers are now available and at lower costs; however, the cost is still expensive (similar to $30,000). Many of these printers use bed heating rather than controlled environment heating, which can lead to inhomogeneous heat transfer and inconsistent properties. The key barrier to offering high-temperature environments for desktop-scale FFF systems in a cost-effective manner is that the electrical components must be compatible with, protected from, or removed from environments exceeding 100 degrees C. To enable desktop-scale FFF printing of high-performance polymers at a low cost and high quality, the authors present a novel inverted FFF system design that provides a build environment of up to 400 degrees C. The inverted configuration effectively isolates the system electronics from the heated build environment, which allows for the use of inexpensive components. In this paper, the authors verify the inverted design concept analytically via a computational fluid dynamics model. The concept is then experimentally validated via a comparison of the strength of PPSF components printed on the inverted desktop-scale FFF system.

We developed a template-free additive manufacturing (AM) process based on direct laser writing (DLW) that can create complex 3D architectures out of titania (TiO2) with similar to 100 nm resolution. In this process, we synthesize hybrid organic-inorganic materials that contain titanium clusters coordinated with acrylic ligands to prepare a photoresist that is amenable to two-photon lithography (TPL). We sculpt a pre-ceramic architecture using TPL and then pyrolyze in air at 900 degrees C to remove the organic constituents to produce a replica of the original structure with similar to 70% reduced linear dimensions. Energy-Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and Raman spectroscopy confirm the constituent solid to consist predominantly out of rutile titania. We demonstrate this process by fabricating titania woodpile structures with lateral dimensions of 70 x 70 mu m and lateral periodicities between 1.0 and 1.3 mu m. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveals passive tuning of the reflectance peak between 1.7 and 2.3 mu m, which agrees with Plane Wave Expansion simulations. This titania AM process offers a promising pathway to efficiently fabricate complex 3D nano-architectures out of a high-index material for 3D dielectric photonic crystals in the visible and the infrared.

The toughening of state-of-the-art materials is an integral requirement for the advancement of photopolymer-based three-dimensional (3D) products. Here we show that the final material properties of acrylate networks can be adjusted through regulation of the radical curing mechanism using difunctional vinyl sulfonate esters to obtain toughened 3D structured materials. A substantial improvement of the thermomechanical behavior of resulting materials over materials regulated by state-of-the-art reagents (e.g. thiols) is presented and first 3D parts have successfully been printed. Resulting materials exhibit reduced shrinkage stress, reduced warpage, higher overall conversion and higher glass transition temperatures compared with the pure acrylate network.

The use of this manufacturing technique has made it possible for the manufacturing of cost-effective, single, complex and customized automotive components. Of all the available additive manufacturing techniques, stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS), fused deposition modelling (FDM), laminated object manufacturing (LOM) and inkjet are the most used in the creation of polymer composite parts in the automotive industry. In spite of the success recorded in the use of AM of polymer composites in the automotive industry, the technology is limited by the size and quantity of parts produced as some of the components are massive in size and often requires mass production. Hence, AM should be a complement and not a replacement to traditional manufacturing methods in the automotive industry. In this review, the progress made and some of the challenges that are associated with the use of AM of polymer-based composites in the automotive industry are presented.

In this context, magnetically loaded polymer composites with oriented magnetic particles are promising for many electrical and electronic applications. In this study, permanent magnet based alignment configurations were evaluated and compared in terms of different magnetic flux density using the finite element method. The particle alignment in cured droplet specimens and the stability of magnetically loaded polymer droplets deposited on a substrate were characterized for a material jetting based additive manufacturing process. Particle alignment and droplet deformation under the influence of the magnetic field was captured using real-time optical microscopy. The influence of rheological additives in controlling droplet stability in the magnetic field and mitigating particle settling were studied through experiments. The primary goal of this research was to identify parameters that facilitate high particle alignment, and material combinations that enhance droplet stability and mitigate particle settling. This fundamental research serves to enhance the understanding of processes and material behaviour for material jetting based additive manufacturing.	[Nagarajan, Balakrishnan; Aguilera, Alejandro F.

As 3D printing has been burgeoning in recent times, a tremendous transformation can be envisaged in medical care, especially the manufacturing procedures leading to personalized medicine. Stereolithography (SLA), a vat-photopolymerization technique, that uses a laser beam, is known for its ability to fabricate complex 3D structures ranging from micron-size needles to life-size organs, because of its high resolution, precision, accuracy, and speed. This review presents a glimpse of varied 3D printing techniques, mainly expounding SLA in terms of the materials used, the orientation of printing, and the working mechanisms. The previous works that focused on developing pharmaceutical dosage forms, drug-eluting devices, and tissue scaffolds are presented in this paper, followed by the challenges associated with SLA from an industrial and regulatory perspective. Due to its excellent advantages, this technology could transform the conventional "one dose fits all" concept to bring digitalized patient-centric medication into reality.

J	Oliari, SH; D'Oliveira, ASCM; Schulz, M				Oliari, Stella Holzbach; Climaco Monteiro D'Oliveira, Ana Sofia; Schulz, Martin			Additive Manufacturing of H11 with Wire-Based Laser Metal Deposition	SOLDAGEM & INSPECAO			English	Article						Laser additive manufacturing; Hot work tool steel; Parametric study; LMD-W	PARAMETERS; COMPONENTS; COATINGS	Laser additive manufacturing (LAM) is a near-net-shape production technique by which a part can be built up from 3D CAD model data, without material removal. Recently, these production processes gained attention due to the spreading of polymer-based processes in private and commercial applications. However, due to the insufficient development of metal producing processes regarding design, process information and qualification, resistance on producing functional components with this technology is still present. To overcome this restriction further studies have to be undertaken. The present research proposes a parametric study of additive manufacturing of hot work tool steel, H11. The selected LAM process is wire-based laser metal deposition (LMD-W). The study consists of parameters optimization for single beads (laser power, travel speed and wire feed rate) as well as lateral and vertical overlap for layer-by-layer technique involved in LMD process. Results show that selection of an ideal set of parameters affects substantially the surface quality, bead uniformity and bond between substrate and clad. Discussion includes the role of overlapping on the soundness of parts based on the height homogeneity of each layer, porosity and the presence of gaps. For the conditions tested it was shown that once the deposition parameters are selected, lateral and vertical overlapping determines the integrity and quality of parts processed by LAM.

This review analyzes possible ways to create a functionally graded piezoceramic material (gradient chemical composition, gradient porosity-controlled and disordered porosity) by additive manufacturing methods, to control such materials' functional characteristics. An analysis of the creation of gradient piezoceramics using binder jetting technology is presented in more detail. The review shows that today, the creation of functional gradient piezoceramics by additive manufacturing is a poorly-studied but promising research area, due to the rapid development of the additive manufacturing market and their unique features in shaping parts.

The polymer melts inside the hot-end channel and flows under the pressure generated by the filament feeding force. The flow of polymer through the hot-end is not fully understood yet, as it involves many complex phenomena, such as phase transition, shear rate and temperature dependent viscosity, as well as viscoelastic effects. In this paper, we investigate experimentally the filament feeding force, as a function of the feeding rate, for different materials (PLA and ABS), liquefier temperatures, nozzle diameters, and lengths of the liquefier. Two extrusion regimes are identified: a linear regime with a stable flow, and a non-linear regime with fluctuations in the feeding force, which are concomitant to unstable extrusion. Increasing the liquefier length and liquefier temperature are found to extend the linear extrusion regime. It is shown that the filament feeding force predicted by the analytical models available in the literature deviates from the measurements, especially at high feeding rates. A model solely based on heat transfer considerations is proposed to estimate the maximum feeding rate before the extrusion becomes unstable. The modelling results agree well with the measurements. The model can be used to select the hot-end design as well as appropriate printing parameters.

Geometric characterization of additively manufactured polymer derived ceramics	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Ceramics; Preceramic polymers; Microtomography; Pyrolysis		The high hardness, melting temperature and environmental resistance of most ceramic materials makes them well-suited for propulsion, tribilogical and protective applications. However, these same attributes pose difficulties for manufacturing and machining of ceramics and ultimately limit the achievable design space of these materials. Recently, a new class of preceramic photopolymers has been developed that enables additive manufacturing of ceramics using commercially available stereolithography systems. By consolidating preceramic monomers via layer-wise exposure to ultraviolet light and subsequently pyrolyzing under an inert atmosphere to form a ceramic, this method allows for complex geometry parts that cannot be produced with traditional sintering, pressing or vapor infiltration processes. In order to retain geometric fidelity and generate flaw-free microstructures, volumetric and gravimetric changes during the polymer-to-ceramic conversion must be quantified. To this end, we present x-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) measurements of the dimensional stability and uniformity of additively manufactured silicon-based ceramics as a function of geometry and processing conditions.

The simultaneous material and structure forming in AM broadens the material and structural design space. This expanded design space holds a great potential in creating improved engineering materials and products that attract growing interests from both academia and industry. A major aspect of this growing interest is reflected in the increased adaptation of data-driven tools that accelerate the exploration of the vast design space in AM. Herein, the integration of data-driven tools in various aspects of AM is reviewed, from materials design in AM (i.e., homogeneous and composite material design) to structure design for AM (i.e., topology optimization). The optimization of AM tool path using machine learning for producing best-quality AM products with optimal material and structure is also discussed. Finally, the perspectives on the future development of holistically integrated frameworks of AM and data-driven methods are provided.

In the field of medical science AM is very much useful in the development of Bone Scaffolds. The bone scaffold needs the good level of porosity for the cultivation of cells. In this work, an algorithm for a novel structure with the theme of flexible porosity was introduced. Scaffold models were developed using CATIA V5 for four different porosities. The novel structures made of Poly Amide (PA 2200) material were fabricated using a commercially available Selective Laser Sintering machine (SLS). The differences in scaffold theoretical and experimental porosities were investigated and the percentage of error was discussed.

Department of Biomedical Engineering and Measurement together with Biomedical Engineering company designed and produced more than 300 implants made of Ti64 ELI titanium alloy using additive technologies, which were subsequently implanted by surgeons worldwide. 3D printing of PEEK, bioceramic and magnesium alloys implants is recently tested to offer alternative materials to titanium for cranioplasties or biodegradable impalnts. 3D bioprinting is being applied to regenerative medicine to address the need for tissues and organs suitable for transplantation. Compared with non-biological printing, 3D bioprinting involves additional complexities, such as the choice of materials, cell types, growth and differentiation factors, and technical challenges related to the sensitivities of living cells and the construction of tissues. The 3D bioplotter was used to prepare tubular structures made of PLA + PHB polymer for substitutes of human urethra. Tubular structures were tested from geometrical point of view to assure required precision, repeatability and possibility to print porous structures for application of epithelial and muscle cells and their growth. Several studies on PEEK spinal implants manufactured by 3D printing were realized, where mechanical testing, simulations and testing of biocompatibility were implemented. Presented research covers selected case studies of patient specific implants made by additive manufacturing and research in medical 3D bioprinting for tissue engineering.

The Effect of Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing on Integrated Printed Electronic Conductors	ELECTRONIC MATERIALS LETTERS			English	Article						Ultrasonic additive manufacturing; Printed electronics; Isotropic conductive adhesives; Ultrasonic energy; Embedded electronics	ELECTRICAL MATERIALS; CONSOLIDATION; ALUMINUM; MATRIX; STRENGTH; FIBERS; MODEL	Ultrasonic additive manufacturing (UAM) is a low temperature manufacturing method capable of embedding printed electronics in metal components. The effect of UAM processing on the resistivity of conductive tracks printed with five different conductive pastes based on silver, copper or carbon flakes/particles in either a thermoplastic or thermoset filler binder are investigated. For all but the carbon-based paste, the resistivity changed linearly with the UAM energy input. After UAM processing, a resistivity increase of more than 150 times was recorded for the copper based thermoset paste. The silver based pastes showed a resistivity increase of between 1.1 and 50 times from their initial values. The carbon-based paste showed no change in resistivity after UAM processing. Focussed ion beam microstructure analysis of the printed conductive tracks before and after UAM processing showed that the silver particles and flakes in at least one of the pastes partly dislodged from their thermoset filler creating voids, thereby increasing the resistivity, whereas the silver flakes in a thermoplastic filler did not dislodge due to material flow of the polymer binder. The lowest resistivity (8 x 10(-5) Omega cm) after UAM processing was achieved for a thermoplastic paste with silver flakes at low UAM processing energy. [GRAPHICS] .

Hybrid microfabrication of 3D pyrolytic carbon electrodes by photolithography and additive manufacturing	MICRO AND NANO ENGINEERING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; CMEMS; Pyrolytic carbon; SU-8		We report a novel hybrid method for fabricating high aspect ratio 3D pyrolytic carbon electrodes combining UV photolithography and additive manufacturing with commercially available SLA 3D printers and materials. By using a 3D printed chip holder, aligned 3D printing on a patterned silicon chip was possible. This allowed for the fabrication of cylindrical polymer micropillars with a height of 2173 +/-& nbsp;26 mu m and a width of 316 +/-& nbsp;11 mu m on SU-8 precursor structures defining the leads, contact pads and underlying 2D electrode prepared using UV lithography. Microfabrication of 3D structures with these dimensions is impossible to achieve with SU-8 photolithography alone. The hybrid polymer structures were converted into 3D carbon electrodes with high structural integrity using a 3-step pyrolysis process optimized for the specific 3D print resin. During this process, the micropillars shrunk to 30 +/-& nbsp;3% in height and 35 +/-& nbsp;1% in width of the polymer precursor structures, while maintaining the macroscopic shape and microscopic surface roughness. Electrochemical experiments confirmed that the pyrolytic carbon formed a monolithic conductive 3D electrode. The surface roughness contributed to a 17 +/-& nbsp;5% increase in electroactive surface area compared to the geometrical surface area of the micropillars.

To reduce the SLJ eccentricity during the tensile loading an appropriate chamfering of the polymer part shape was proposed by applying the AM technology. The Zortax M300 printer was used to produce the polymer adherends and "dog bone" type specimens, which allowed the determination of tensile strength, which value was 6.62 MPa. The effectiveness of the joints was assessed by the maximum force values, the absorption energy, and the repeat-ability of the results for each model. The highest force of 400.4 N was obtained for the single-lap reference model. Finally, hybrid joints were produced by the application of double-sided tape and mechanical connectors, like tenons placed in the 3D printed polymer part and mortises situated in the aluminium adherends. This new joining technique allowed for an increase in maximum force to a value of 832.5 N.

These measurements were performed using both the Revolution Powder Analyzer and the Schulze Ring Shear Tester. The latter device was modified with a selfdeveloped heating system to allow testing at temperatures up to 170 degrees C. Overall, the results of both tests showed that the powders' flowability decreases as the temperature increases, with the largest decrease observed near the materials' melting point. Afterwards, recoating tests were conducted on an EOS P395 machine, which utilized a self-built AI monitoring system to detect and evaluate the severity of defects in the powder bed. The tests revealed that the number and severity of defects also increases with temperature. When approaching the sintering window, the number and severity of defects greatly decreases, and the powder bed becomes stronger and more resistant to defects.	[Ruether, Moritz; Klippstein, S.

In this method, an FFF 3D printer prints a resin mold that functions as a structural unit in a multi-material structure and as a sacrificial plastic mold for the addition of the metal material. This sacrificial mold is eventually removed. Electroforming the interior of a printed resin mold enables the fabrication of multi-material structures using resin and metal materials. The fabrication conditions for multi-material structures when using the proposed method were investigated and the surfaces of the resulting structures were evaluated. The fabrication conditions for the specified thickness per process and the total thicknesses from all the processes were determined. Furthermore, our results indicated that the shape of the side of the metal portion depended on the forming precision of the FFF 3D printer. We present an example of the fabrication of a gear shape from resin and metal.

We select two Al2O3 powders (a-and high-surface-area theta-Al2O3) and polymeric binders for preparing the 3DP feedstock. Catalyst stacked Al2O3 disks are made by kneading the polymers with ceramic powders and extruding to produce filaments, which are melted and used for 3D additive manufacturing (AM). The processing parameters (sequence of addition, viscosity of the feedstock, etc.), the phase transformation of the.-powder, and catalytic properties of the made carrier are examined. The made alumina disks were densified to a relative density (RD) of 40% -65%. Two porous disks were coated with catalyst NiO and CeO2, and used to reform syngas made from waste paper. The best case reforms the CH4 content in the syngas from 25.7% down to 0.15% or lower. The reformed gaseous fuel is suitable for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).	[Fan, N. C.; Chen, Y. Y.; Chen, K.

However, various quality issues, especially porosity, significantly impacts the mechanical properties and fatigue life of the final products, which imposes barriers for the widespread adoption of metal AM processes. In this study, we use the deep learning (DL) techniques to comprehensively investigate the relationships between pore microstructure and processing parameters. Specifically, a novel hybrid deep generative prediction network (HDGPN) that leverages both variational autoencoder and generative adversarial network is proposed to characterize the complex pore microstructure with in-depth representations and predict pore morphology under arbitrary processing parameters. By visualizing the predicted pore morphology, the complicated interaction dynamics between the processing parameters and pore microstructure are directly revealed, which may guide the optimization of metal AM manufacturing processes to fabricate defect-free products. A case study of a selective laser melting (SLM) process is conducted to validate the proposed modeling and prediction framework.

Additive manufacturing of hydrogels is a very popular method to produce scaffolds to be used in tissue engineering and other biomedical applications, as well as in other advanced technological areas. When printing a thermoreversible physical hydrogel, a subtle balance between thermal and rheological parameters exists. The characteristic times of the sol-gel transition, regulated by a well-defined thermal history, must be optimized with respect to the characteristic processing times. In this work, we use this thermo-rheological approach to the additive manufacturing of a physical hydrogel. A low-cost desktop 3D printer for thermoplastic polymers was suitably modified to print a 1.5 wt% solution of k-carrageenan. The thermal behavior of the printer was determined by performing experimental measurements of the temperature-time evolution during the different processing steps, from solution loading, to the extrusion of the incoming gel, to the final solidification stage. In parallel, linear viscoelastic oscillatory shear measurements were performed in a rotational rheometer under thermal histories as close as possible to those previously measured in the printing process. The comparison between the rheological results and the quality of printing under different thermal histories is presented and discussed, highlighting the main relations between rheological and processing behavior, which are helpful in the assessment and optimization of the printing conditions.

Polylactic acid (PLA), a thermoplastic biobased and biodegradable polymer, is used as matrix for the composite filament, as it is the most common plastic used in FDM due to its good mechanical properties, stiffness, and strength. Upon production process optimization, filaments with rCF loadings of 5 and 10% wt are produced and analyzed. A particular attention is devoted to the evaluation of the production process on the carbon fibers (CFs) length and the study of the thermal and mechanical properties of the obtained composite materials.

In terms of mechanical applications, however, research on the tribological characteristics of 3D printing components has not been sufficiently conducted. This study investigated the influences of surface texturing and roughness on 3D printed specimens. Specimens with and without surface texture were printed using a 3D printer, and their frictional behavior was compared. The friction coefficient of the textured specimen was smaller than that of the untextured specimen. Contact analysis was conducted to evaluate the mechanism. The analysis suggested that the real contact area of the untextured specimen was similar to that of the textured specimen during the initial stage. However, the wear of asperities during the friction test increased the real contact area of the untextured specimen. Surface roughness was verified to influence the untextured specimen more significantly than the textured specimen in terms of tribological behavior.

Methods: Specimens of 3D printing denture base polymers were prepared by two printers, namely, stereolithography (SLA, Form 3B) and digital light processing technology (DLP, Solflex 350 plus). Three build angles were used: 0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees. Surface topography was examined by scanning electron microscopy. Also, arithmetical mean height (Sa) values were calculated. An adhesion test was performed to observe initial C. albicans adhesion to the specimens. The data were statistically analyzed using the two-way analysis of variance and Tukey's multiple comparison test. Results: The data of Sa values had statistically significant differences, which were mainly determined by the main factor of build angle (p < 0.05). Moreover, the quantitative results of C. albicans adhesion exhibited no significant differences: printing techniques (p = 0.7794) and build angle (p = 0.0589), respectively. Conclusions: Surface roughness was significantly influenced by the build angle rather than by the AM method. Whereas, AM method (SLA and DLP) and build angle (0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90o) had no impacts on the C. albicans adhesion to the 3D printed denture bases. Clinical Significance: Build angle dominates the surface roughness and topography of the 3D printed denture polymers. Our results indicate that C. albicans' adhesion might not be influenced by AM method and build angle.

How to maximize the structural efficiency of a part to achieve the desired performance has become the focus and challenge of design for additive manufacturing (DFAM). To give full play to the complex-geometry, multi-material, multi-scale, and multi-function manufacturing capabilities of AM, new approaches in DFAM have to be explored. The relationship between stress and growth in biology indicates that naturally evolved perfect structures are all optimal responses to their applied force. This work discusses a novel method to DFAM at the macroscale, mesoscale and microscale from a force-flow perspective, aiming to achieve an organic integration of force-flow based design with AM-driven manufacturing. Firstly, the characteristics of force-flow and its embodiment in nature and engineering are analyzed. Then, an overview of topology optimization, lattice/cellular structure design and infill pattern design are respectively provided in the combination of force-flow and AM. Finally, the future development directions of DFAM based on force flow are proposed according to the limitations of current research. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Carbon fiber offers a low density, a low coefficient of thermal expansion, and high thermal conductivity and is an ideal material for bringing polymer-based AM from the realm of form and fit to that of form, fit, and function. Use of carbon fiber in AM can improve material properties, reduce the time required to manufacture functional parts compared with traditional subtractive technologies, and reduce warping, thereby enabling a larger possible build envelope. Therefore, the addition of carbon fiber to various AM technologies is of increasing interest in academic and industrial communities. This paper examines the work performed in this fast-growing area to date. Specifically, the effects of fiber reinforcement on the structure and mechanical properties of 3D printed parts are investigated within the body of literature. Upper bounds for tensile properties of carbon fiber composites are theoretically evaluated and compared with experimentally measured values. Moreover, current and potential applications of additively manufactured carbon fiber composites in the context of desktop 3D printing and big area AM are discussed. Recent innovations and industry breakthroughs in this field are also examined. This review is intended to organize and synthesize the present body of work surrounding AM of carbon fiber reinforced plastics, identify the most promising technologies, and prescribe viable research and development paths forward to advance AM from the application space of rapid prototyping to that of functional, load-bearing, end-use parts.

J	Huang, W; Ji, HL; Ding, Y; Qiu, JH				Huang, Wei; Ji, Hongli; Ding, Ye; Qiu, Jinhao			Wave Attenuation in Additively Manufactured Polymer Acoustic Black Hole Structures Considering the Viscoelastic Effect	POLYMERS			English	Article						acoustic black hole; polymer structures; broadband wave attenuation; viscoelastic effect; additive manufacturing	FLEXURAL WAVES; OPTIMIZATION; PROPAGATION; MODEL	The acoustic black hole (ABH) is a feature commonly found in thin-walled structures that is characterized by a diminishing thickness and damping layer with an efficient wave energy dissipation effect, which has been extensively studied. The additive manufacture of polymer ABH structures has shown promise as a low-cost method to manufacture ABHs with complex geometries, exhibiting even more effective dissipation. However, the commonly used elastic model with viscous damping for both the damping layer and polymer ignores the viscoelastic changes that occur due to variations in frequency. To address this, we used Prony exponential series expansion to describe the viscoelastic behavior of the material, where the modulus is represented by a summation of decaying exponential functions. The parameters of the Prony model were obtained through experimental dynamic mechanical analysis and applied to finite element models to simulate wave attenuation characteristics in polymer ABH structures. The numerical results were validated by experiments, where the out-of-plane displacement response under a tone burst excitation was measured by a scanning laser doppler vibrometer system. The experimental results illustrated good consistency with the simulations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Prony series model in predicting wave attenuation in polymer ABH structures. Finally, the effect of loading frequency on wave attenuation was studied. The findings of this study have implications for the design of ABH structures with improved wave attenuation characteristics.

They mostly concerns control rheology at fresh state, setting time, and technology advances. Nevertheless, the reinforcement of 3D printed part remains an open question. Different reinforcement protocols have been proposed in the literature, often based on traditional way of reinforcement. In this context, the aim of this paper is to present an alternative way to reinforce extruded concrete or other pasty materials inspired by the composite industry. The present patented manufacturing methodology is based on extrusion-based additive manufacturing, inspired by pultrusion and co-extrusion process of polymer composites, but taking full advantage of the specific rheological behaviour of cementitious matrix. It consists in the continuous addition of numerous continuous yarn in the extruded mortar before the final extrusion. A comparison between those processes is made. Depending on the number of yarns and their sizes, this process is showed to provide ductility for limited amount of reinforcement and have the potential to be an alternative to passive rebar traditionally used in concrete by providing a true reinforcement in traction to the structure for larger number of yarns, changing extruded concrete in unidirectional composite with brittle matrix. Using appropriate matrix formulation, the mastering of its yield stress during the extrusion is showed to be the most important process parameters. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The system is divided into four main points: (1) pre-processing, (2) color analysis, (3) shape analysis, and (4) defect location. The color analysis is performed in CIELAB color space, and the color distance between the part under analysis and the reference surface is calculated using the color difference formula CIE2000. The shape analysis consists of the binarization of the image using the Canny edge detector. Then, the Hu moments are calculated for images from the part under analysis and the results are compared with those from the reference part. To locate defects, the image of the part to be analyzed is first processed with a median filter, and both the original and filtered image are subtracted. Then, the resulting image is binarized, and the defects are located through a blob detector. In the training phase, a subset of parts was used to evaluate the performance of different methods and to set the values of parameters. Later, in a testing and validation phase, the performance of the system was evaluated using a different set of parts. The results show that the proposed system is able to classify parts produced by additive manufacturing, with an overall accuracy of 86.5%, and to locate defects on their surfaces in a more effective manner.

The use of these materials is currently being expanded through the rapid development of additive manufacturing. However, there is still no universal method for fabricating two-dimensional anisotropic polymer composites. Here, polylactic acid-carbon fiber composites were prepared using the droplet spray method, and their mechanical and friction properties were studied. The tensile strength in the X-Y plane perpendicular to the direction of the droplet spray was significantly higher than that in the direction of droplet ejection. Similar trends were observed for the elongation at breaking and the impact strength. The friction coefficient was smallest in the X-Y plane. Scanning electron microscopy showed that carbon fibers were oriented in the X-Y plane, which enhanced the mechanical and friction properties in this plane.

All-Printed In-Plane Supercapacitors by Sequential Additive Manufacturing Process	ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS			English	Article						supercapacitor; additive manufacturing; 3D printing; printed electronics; in-space manufacturing	SOLID-STATE; GRAPHENE; ELECTRODES	Supercapacitors are attractive due to their high power density and durability relative to batteries. Printing technology has been rapidly emerging as manufacturing friendly, with a quick turn around and low-cost approach to produce a variety of devices. Herein, we show an end-to-end printing of supercapacitors including the substrate, current collector and active layers, and a gel polymer electrolyte, all simply printed. Two types of supercapacitors, electrochemical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) and pseudocapacitor (PC), were developed with activated carbon and graphene-Mn3O4 nanocomposite-based active layers, respectively. The all-printed supercapacitors show specific power and specific energy of 800.3 W/kg and 1.17 Wh/kg (at 0.5 A/g) for the EDLC and 1601 W/kg and 10.6 Wh/kg (at 1 A/g) for the PC. Extended durability tests reveal that the EDLC exhibits negligible performance deviation after 100 000 charge/discharge cycles while the PC shows less than 10% capacitance degradation after 25 000 cycles.

This architecture comprises an active ferroelectric ceramic phase and a passive flexible polymer phase, which are separated by a tailorable phase interface. Triply periodic minimal surfaces were used to define the phase interface, due to their excellent elastic properties and load transfer efficiency. A suspension-enclosing projection-stereolithography process was used to additively manufacture this material. Postprocesses including polymer infiltration, electroding, and poling are introduced. Piezoelectric properties of the piezocomposites are numerically and experimentally studied. The results highlight the role of tailorable triply periodic phase interfaces in promoting mechanical flexibility and piezoelectricity of bi-continuous piezocomposites.

Development of modified release 3D printed tablets (printlets) with pharmaceutical excipients using additive manufacturing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS			English	Article						Three dimensional printing; Controlled-release; Fused deposition modeling; Paracetamol; Acetaminophen; Additive manufacturing; Personalized medicines; Additive manufacture; Rapid prototyping	HOT-MELT EXTRUSION; DRUG-RELEASE; DOSAGE FORMS; 3-DIMENSIONAL PRINTING(TM); FABRICATION; DELIVERY; PHYSIOLOGY; BEHAVIOR; DEVICES	The aim of this study was to manufacture 3D printed tablets (printlets) from enteric polymers by single filament fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing (3DP). Hot melt extrusion was used to generate paracetamol-loaded filaments from three different grades of the pharmaceutical excipient hypromellose acetate succinate (HPMCAS), grades LG, MG and HG. One-step 3DP was used to process these filaments into enteric printlets incorporating up to 50% drug loading with two different infill percentages (20 and 100%). X-ray Micro Computed Tomography (Micro-CT) analysis revealed that printlets with 20% infill had cavities in the core compared to 100% infill, and that the density of the 50% drug loading printlets was higher than the equivalent formulations loaded with 5% drug. In biorelevant bicarbonate dissolution media, drug release from the printlets was dependent on the polymer composition, drug loading and the internal structure of the formulations. All HPMCAS-based printlets showed delayed drug release properties, and in the intestinal conditions, drug release was faster from the printlets prepared with polymers with a lower pH-threshold: HPMCAS LG > HPMCAS MG > HPMCAS HG. These results confirm that FDM 3D printing makes it possible not only to manufacture delayed release printlets without the need for an outer enteric coating, but it is also feasible to adapt the release profile in response to the personal characteristics of the patient, realizing the full potential of additive manufacturing in the development of personalised dose medicines.

Moreover, 3D printed cementitious material is orthotropic and have a weakness line between layers. Conventional reinforcement technique for concrete utilizes rigid rebars to impart mechanical performance of concrete structures and improve its loading carrying capacity. However, rigid rebars limit the free-form capabilities of additive manufacturing and goes against its freedom of design principle. To overcome this issue, glass fiber reinforced polymer and carbon fiber reinforced polymer sheets were used to reinforced 3D printed cementitious material in this study. The reinforced printed concrete specimens were tested on four-point bending test, and the influence of FRP on 3D printable mortar and fiber reinforced mortar were analyzed based on load capacity, ductility, fracture energy and failure mode.

To this end, the cloud point and solution temperature curve of the PAll-ethanol system was determined experimentally via turbidity measurements. The proper range of system composition and temperature for particle formation was deduced. The dependence of particle characteristics on process parameters (polymer concentration, stirring conditions and temperature regime) during LLPS and precipitation was assessed and the products were characterized with respect to their size and morphology. Furthermore, structural, rheological and thermal characteristics were analyzed and correlated with process parameters. Molecular weight distributions were determined. After removal of fines and dry coating with hydrophobic fumed silica, an optimized PA11 powder with mean particle size of 91 mu m showing good flowability for SLS was obtained. SLS processability of this optimized PA11 powder was demonstrated by building multilayered test specimens in a laser sintering machine. With this contribution, we present a comprehensive workflow for the process development, product characterization and product application of a SLS powder manufactured via precipitation.

To enhance the process repeatability, effective in-situ monitoring methods for AM processes are needed. In this study, an online monitoring method for AM process failure detection is proposed, where acoustic emission (AE) is applied as the sensing technique. Its application to polymer material extrusion, also known as the technology of fused deposition modeling (FDM), is demonstrated. Experimental results show that the proposed monitoring method allows for the real time identification of major process failures. The occurring time of major failures and failure modes can be identified by analyzing the time- and frequency-domain features of AE hits respectively. A K-means clustering algorithm is applied to verify and demonstrate the classification procedure. The automated failure identification can reduce the waste of fabrication with enhanced machine intelligence.

The AM of continuous fiber reinforced composite is a technology that, although still in its initial development, appears to be very promising. The AM process could be particularly interesting for the production of prosthetic devices for sports (ESAR devices such as foot or foil). In this work, is explored the potential of additive manufacturing in the field of prosthetics of the lower limb through an multidisciplinary approach, involving several competences from the clinical evaluation, integration of biomechanics, development of new composite and hybrid materials based on polymers, carbon fibres and metal inserts, and implementation of optical sensors with their integration in the composites for the continuous monitoring of prosthetic devices and their durability.

Although PEEK provides outstanding strength and thermal stability, printing can be difficult due to the high melting point. Recently, high-temperature soluble support has enabled the printing of lattices and stochastic foams with overhanging features in these high-performance carbon fiber thermoplastics, in which density can be optimized to strike a balance between weight and strength to enhance performance in applications such as custom implants or aerospace structures. Although polymer powder bed fusion has long been capable of the combination of these geometries and materials, material extrusion with high-temperature sacrificial support is dramatically less expensive. This research provides a comprehensive mechanical analysis and CT-scan-based dimensional study of carbon fiber PEEK lattice structures enabled with high-temperature support and including model validation.

The focus is on resistive and capacitive sensors and electromagnetic actuators, though others are anticipated. Anticipated applications beyond robotics include advanced prosthetics, wearable electronics, and defense electronics. This paper presents preliminary results for printing polymers and conductive material simultaneously to form small sensor arrays. Approaches to optimizing sensor performance are discussed.

A commercial fused-deposition-model (FDM) 3D printer was modified to extrude pastes of powder materials into 3D structures. We formulated a low-temperature curable Poly-Mag paste, which is a mixture of magnetic powder and a polymer, as a feed material for printing the magnetic core and used a commercial nanosilver paste for printing the winding. After the structure was printed, it was cured at 250 degrees C for an hour without any external pressure to form the magnetic component. The electrical resistivity of the printed winding was about three times higher than that of bulk silver. This is because of the low curing temperature resulted in a lower density than the bulk. The relative permeability dispersion of the printed core had a bandwidth up to 10 MHz with a static relative permeability of about 10. Both the winding and core magnetic properties will be improved by adjusting the feed paste formulations and their flow characteristics and fine-tuning the printer parameters, such as motor speeds, extrusion rate, and nozzle sizes.

Two key determinants of their utility are their rheological behavior in the molten state, determining AM processability and their mechanical load-bearing properties. We report here the characterization of both these physical properties for four bone TE relevant composite formulations with poly(ethylene oxide terephthalate)/poly(butylene terephthalate (PEOT/PBT) as a base polymer, which is often used to fabricate TE scaffolds. The fillers used were reduced graphene oxide (rGO), hydroxyapatite (HA), gentamicin intercalated in zirconium phosphate (ZrP-GTM) and ciprofloxacin intercalated in MgAl layered double hydroxide (MgAl-CFX). The rheological assessment showed that generally the viscous behavior dominated the elastic behavior (G" > G') for the studied composites, at empirically determined extrusion temperatures. Coupled rheological-thermal characterization of ZrP-GTM and HA composites showed that the fillers increased the solidification temperatures of the polymer melts during cooling. Both these findings have implications for the required extrusion temperatures and bonding between layers. Mechanical tests showed that the fillers generally not only made the polymer stiffer but more brittle in proportion to the filler fractions. Furthermore, the elastic moduli of scaffolds did not directly correlate with the corresponding bulk material properties, implying composite-specific AM processing effects on the mechanical properties. Finally, we show computational models to predict multimaterial scaffold elastic moduli using measured single material scaffold and bulk moduli. The reported characterizations are essential for assessing the AM processability and ultimately the suitability of the manufactured scaffolds for the envisioned bone regeneration application.

However, it is difficult for existing processing techniques to form continuous basalt architectures with three-dimensional (3D) complex shapes. In addition, the basalt fibers in the architectures are filled with polymers, which cannot fully utilize the performance of basalt fibers. Therefore, here, we report the fabrication of continuous basalt fibers with fireproof and thermal insulation performance through the combination of an Additive manufacturing (AM) manipulator, two-step precursor infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) processes. Using SiOC ceramics to fill between continuous basalt fibers will help improve the architectures' fire and thermal insulation performance. The continuous basalt fibers coated with thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) were processed into 3D architectures under the action of the laser. Through the vacuum infiltration of the SiOC precursor and debinding process, TPU in the 3D architectures was removed. In order to reduce the structural defects generated by the first PIP process, the final part with fireproof and thermal insulation performance was fabricated through the second PIP process. We further demonstrated the final part with excellent fireproof and thermal insulation performance. The final part had a shell temperature of 788.8 degrees C and an internal temperature of about 50 degrees C under the flame spray gun for the 20 s. By replacing polymers with inorganic materials, our basalt architectures exhibit their potential applications in military, aviation, and civil fireproof and thermal insulation equipment.

It was developed by combining two 3D-printing methods in parallel. Indeed, an optimized mixture of PVA, sorbitol, and magnesium stearate as a shell compartment was printed through a hot-melt extrusion (HME) nozzle while an HPMC gel mixture of the drug in the core compartment was printed by a pressure-assisted micro-syringe (PAM). A 3D-printed tablet with an infill of 90% was selected as an optimized formula upon the desired dissolution profile, releasing 86% of the drug at 12 h, similar to the commercial one. The weight variation, friability, hardness, assay, and content uniformity determination met USP requirements. A microbial evaluation showed that the 3D-printed tablet does not support microbial growth. SEM analysis showed smooth surfaces with multiple deposited layers. No peak interference appeared based on FTIR analysis. No decomposition of the polymer and drug was observed in the printing temperature, and no change in tacrolimus crystallinity was detected based on TGA and DSC analyses, respectively. The novel, sTable 3D-printed tablet, fabricated using controllable additive manufacturing, can quickly provide tailored dosing with specific kinetic release for personalized medicine at the point-of-care.

It offers a plethora of applications and is already being utilized in almost every sphere of life. Owing to inherent differences between each AM technique, newer fields of research consistently emerge and demand attention. Also, the innovative applications of AM open up newer challenges and thus avenues for focused attention. One such avenue is AM materials. Raw material plays an important role in determining the properties of fabricated part. The type and form of raw material largely depend on the type of AM fabricators. There is a restriction on material compatibility with most of the established AM techniques. This review aims to provide an overview of various aspects of AM materials highlighting the progress made especially over the past two decades.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEX) is a versatile technology for producing complex specimens of polymers, ceramics and metals. Highly-filled filaments composed of a binder system and a high-volume content of sinterable powders are needed to produce ceramic or metal parts. After shaping the parts via MEX, the binder is removed and the specimens are sintered to obtain a dense part of the sintered filler particles. In this article, the applicability of this additive manufacturing process to produce copper specimens is demonstrated. The particular emphasis is on investigating the production of lightweight specimens that retain mechanical properties without increasing their weight. The effect of infill grades and the cover presence on the debinding process and the flexural properties of the sintered parts was studied. It was observed that covers could provide the same flexural strength with a maximum weight reduction of approximately 23%. However, a cover on specimens with less than 100% infill significantly slows down the debinding process. The results demonstrate the applicability of MEX to produce lightweight copper specimens.

Conventional manufacturing techniques, namely extrusion and injection moulding, cannot be applied to fabricate RE structures since they contain lattice structures typically with complex geometries. This issue has been tackled by additive manufacturing (AM), which enables the creation of RE structures from various materials including polymers and metals. This paper provides a comprehensive review on structural design, manufacturing techniques and unique properties that are crucial for sophisticated development of novel metamaterials. Modelling approaches including an optimisation method to obtain the best structure and desired properties are also discussed. Finally, real applications of RE structures in medical engineering, automobiles, aerospace and strain sensing are reported, along with a summary and future challenges for these unique structures.

Tests were carried out initially using virgin ABS, which subsequently underwent two successive closed-loop filament extrusion and 3D printing phases. For each endpoint manufacturing phase, samples were examined to monitor the changes in thermal characteristics, mechanical properties, and polymer degradation. It was found that there was a series of physical changes of the polymer, which resulted in reduced melt flow, increased glass transition temperature, and the generation of carbonyl groups, which may be attributed to the thermal oxidative breakdown of both styrene acrylonitrile (SAN) and butadiene components of ABS. The recycled polymer also showed a reduction in both tensile and compressive strengths compared to the virgin material. However, compared to one-time recycled ABS, two-times recycled ABS showed increased strength, implying that increased recycle state of the polymer may be advantageous with respect to mechanical properties and potential manufacturing applications. This study ultimately demonstrates the potential to leverage additive manufacturing (AM) toward a closed-loop manufacturing paradigm by using waste ABS across several life cycles.

Recycling of such materials is mostly a thermomechanical process that modifies their overall mechanical behavior. The present research work focuses on the acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) polymer, which is the second most popular material used in FFF-3D printing. In order to investigate the effect of the recycling courses on the mechanical response of the ABS polymer, an experimental simulation of the recycling process that isolates the thermomechanical treatment from other parameters (i.e., contamination, ageing, etc.) has been performed. To quantify the effect of repeated recycling processes on the mechanic response of the ABS polymer, a wide variety of mechanical tests were conducted on FFF-printed specimens. Regarding this, standard tensile, compression, flexion, impact and micro-hardness tests were performed per recycle repetition. The findings prove that the mechanical response of the recycled ABS polymer is generally improved over the recycling repetitions for a certain number of repetitions. An optimum overall mechanical behavior is found between the third and the fifth repetition, indicating a significant positive impact of the ABS polymer recycling, besides the environmental one.

The three-dimensional printing process needs post-processing to improve the strength, stiffness and/or surface finish of the parts. Printed parts in pristine condition are generally very brittle with a porous structure, so infiltrates have been introduced to improve their mechanical and physical characteristics. This work investigates the effect of two infiltrates, epoxy polymer and cyanoacrylate, under a vacuum pressure system on the mechanical properties of powder-based composites made by three-dimensional printing. Samples printed under pristine and infiltrated conditions were tested under tensile, flexural, compressive and impact loadings. The infiltrated samples achieved superior mechanical properties, especially when the epoxy polymer was applied via a vacuum system. The microstructural analysis showed that the infiltrates were not able to penetrate the entire sample, revealing a porous structure in the centre, mainly when the cyanoacrylate was used. The epoxy polymer infiltrate was able to substantially increase the mechanical performance of three-dimensional samples, being a promising material when higher structural requirements are required.

Additive manufacturing (Digital Light Processing), providing enhanced structural design ability, was employed to fabricate samples with complex architectures. During pyrolysis, ferrocene catalyzed the in-situ formation of a large amount of turbostratic carbon, graphite and SiC nanosized phases, which formed carrier channels in the electromagnetic field and increased the conductivity loss. Meanwhile, it also increased the dipole polarization, interface polarization and the dielectric properties of the material, which finally enhanced the EMW absorption capacity of SiCN(Fe) ceramics. When containing 0.5 wt % ferrocene, the material showed good performance with EAB 4.57 GHz at 1.30 mm, and RLmin-61.34 dB at 2.22 mm. The RLmin of 3D-SiCN-0.5 ceramics was-6 dB, and the RL of the X-band was lower than-4 dB at 2 mm.

This paper reports on Selective Laser Melting (SLM) for depositing glass which has significantly different material properties from metals, ceramics or polymers. A CO2 laser is used to locally melt portions of a powder bed to explore the effects of process parameters on stationary particle formation as well as continuous line quality. Numerical modeling is also applied to gain insight into the physical process. The experimental and numerical results indicate that the absorptivity of the glass powder is nearly constant with respect to the processing parameters. Finally we show that higher quality parts can be created using a wire-fed instead of powder bed process.

This includes biomodels for diagnosis, surgical training, hard and soft tissue replacement, biodevices and tissue engineering. Moreover, recent developments in high-definition additive manufacturing systems such as Multi-Jet Modelling (MJM) and Stereolithography (SLA), capable of reproducing feature sizes close to 100 mu m, promise brand new capabilities in fabrication of optical-grade biomicrofluidic Lab-on-a-Chip and MEMS devices. Compared with other rapid prototyping technologies such as soft lithography and infrared laser micromachining in PMMA, SLA and MJM systems can enable user-friendly production of prototypes, superior feature reproduction quality and comparable levels of optical transparency. Prospectively they can revolutionize fabrication of microfluidic devices with complex geometric features and eliminate the need to use clean room environment and conventional microfabrication techniques. In this work we demonstrate preliminary data on toxicity profiling of a panel of common polymers used in 3D printing applications. The main motivation of our work was to evaluate toxicity profiles of most commonly used polymers using standardized biotests according to OECD guidelines for testing of chemic risk assessment. Our work for the first time provides a multispecies view of potential dangers and limitation for building biocompatible devices using FDM, SLA and MJM additive manufacturing systems. Our work shows that additive manufacturing holds significant promise for fabricating LOC and MEMS but requires caution when selecting systems and polymers due to toxicity exhibited by some 3D printing polymers.

In bone regenerative medicine, in particular, additive manufacturing has the great potential of opening new avenues of development for patient-specific ad hoc therapies. In theory, a defect could be scanned and precisely replicated, thus offering the best fitting for each patient. The main bottleneck to date is the relatively scarce availability of materials that can be printed reliably and consistently. This is the case for organic/inorganic hybrids, materials produced by sol-gel chemistry that combine the advantages of polymers and bioinorganics at the molecular scale. Due to their complex structure and unique rheological and mechanical properties, the printing of hybrids remains challenging. With this study, we aim to investigate the rheological, thermal and molecular properties of a class I polycaprolactone/bioactive glass hybrid and discover how they correlate with the printability of the material. The molecular weight distribution (gel permeation chromatography), thermal properties (thermal gravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry) and rheological properties of each hybrid material were investigated at all stages of processing. Printing trials via direct material extrusion processing followed by morphological characterization were performed on both polymers and hybrids. Their apatite-forming ability in simulated body fluid was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and particle-induced X-ray emission. Results confirmed the successful manufacturing of organic/inorganic hybrids using direct material extrusion processing for the first time. Three-dimensional scaffolds were successfully produced without the need for further processing. No additional solvents or convoluted indirect approaches were necessary. Thanks to the thermal analysis, an ideal temperature window for printing was identified. SBF immersion assays confirmed that the material's bioactivity is retained after printing. Considering the presented findings, material extrusion processing might develop into an essential technique for fabricating superior 3D bioactive scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.

At 300 K, as the mass ratios of BTBAs in the composites increased from 38.5% to 71.4%, both the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of the composites increased from 5.8 S/cm to 13.3 S/cm, and from 60.2 mV/K to 119.9 mV/K, respectively, and the thermal conductivity slightly increased from 0.15 W m(-1)K(-1) to 0.25 W m(-1)K(-1), as a result, the ZT value of the composites increased from 0.004 to 0.023. As the temperature increased from 300 K to 360 K, the electrical conductivity of all the composites slightly decreased, while the thermal conductivity slowly increased, and a highest ZT value of 0.024 was achieved for the composites with 71.4% BTBAs at 320 K. Unlike traditional sterolithography, fused deposition modeling, selective laser melting, etc., this additive manufacturing process can directly print the solutions which contain inorganic fillers and polymer matrixes into almost any designed intricate geometries of thermoelectric composites, therefore this process has great potential to be used for fabrication of flexible polymer based thermoelectric composites and devices.

Terahertz imaging and tomography as efficient instruments for testing polymer additive manufacturing objects	APPLIED OPTICS			English	Article							TIME-DOMAIN SPECTROSCOPY; DIELECTRIC CHARACTERIZATION; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; RADIATION	Additive manufacturing (AM) technology is not only used to make 3D objects but also for rapid prototyping. In industry and laboratories, quality controls for these objects are necessary though difficult to implement compared to classical methods of fabrication because the layer-by-layer printing allows for very complex object manufacturing that is unachievable with standard tools. Furthermore, AM can induce unknown or unexpected defects. Consequently, we demonstrate terahertz (THz) imaging as an innovative method for 2D inspection of polymer materials. Moreover, THz tomography may be considered as an alternative to x-ray tomography and cheaper 3D imaging for routine control. This paper proposes an experimental study of 3D polymer objects obtained by additive manufacturing techniques. This approach allows us to characterize defects and to control dimensions by volumetric measurements on 3D data reconstructed by tomography. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America	[Perraud, J.

The developed polymer-metal colloids are conveyed via the designed spindle-driven dispensing system to demonstrate consolidations of the metallic phase onto heterogeneous substrate materials via laser melting. Modelling of the flow rate, velocity and pressure fields is linked to the geometric design of the mechanical devices in the spindle-driven process. The equilibriums of the heat transfer equations in the colloid element were initiated and presented for the estimations of input laser energy. When the input heat was absorbed by the colloid element, the average energy density could be obtained by the ratio of the overall energy density and the engaged laser scanning volume. In the experimental work of the validation tests, the polymer-metal colloid was consolidated on the substrate material with three different results: unconsolidated, partially consolidated and consolidated. The consolidation and bonding of metallic fractions on the heterogeneous substrate materials in the laser melting actions were evaluated and reported.

Data: Collection of published articles related to vat-polymerization technologies including manufacturing workflow description, and printing parameters definition and evaluation of its influence on the mechanical properties of vat-polymerized dental devices was performed. Sources: Three search engines were selected namely Medline/PubMed, EBSCO, and Cochrane. A manual search was also conducted. Study selection: The selection of the optimal printing and supporting parameters, slicing, and post-processing procedures based on dental application is in continuous improvement. As well as their influence on the characteristics of the additively manufactured (AM) devices such as surface roughness, printing accuracy, and mechanical properties of the dental device. Results: The accuracy and properties of the AM dental devices are influenced by the technology, printer, and material selected. The printing parameters, printing structures, slicing methods, and the post-processing techniques significantly influence on the surface roughness, printing accuracy, and mechanical properties of the manufactured dental device; yet, the optimization of each one may vary depending on the clinical application of the additively manufactured device. Conclusions: The printing parameters, supporting structures, slicing, and post-processing procedures have been identified, but additional studies are needed to establish the optimal manufacturing protocol and enhance the properties of the AM polymer dental devices. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The understanding of the factors involved in the additive manufacturing workflow leads to a printing success and better outcome of the additively manufactured dental device.

The aim of this work is the employment of a multifunctional AM machine for fabricating poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) constructs with a predefined shape and porous architecture, by either melt- or solution-extrusion AM. In particular, PMMA porous scaffolds are manufactured by employing fused filament fabrication (FFF) or computer-aided wet-spinning (CAWS). The comparative characterization of the two developed PMMA implant prototypes demonstrates significant differences in terms of porous structure, polymer surface topography, material composition, glass transition temperature, and mechanical properties. As a consequence, FFF-printed PMMA samples support a faster in vitro proliferation of a murine fibroblast cell line in comparison to PMMA scaffolds by CAWS. The results achieved encourage further research on the developed processing protocols, aimed at the development of tailored PMMA implants for personalized surgery applications. A multifunctional additive manufacturing machine is applied to fabricate poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) scaffolds by either fused filament fabrication or computer-aided wet-spinning. Significant differences in terms of morphology, composition, mechanical properties, and in vitro cell adhesion between the two developed kinds of PMMA scaffold are highlighted in relationship to the different employed processing approaches.image	[Puppi, Dario; Braccini, Simona; Corti, Andrea; Bello, Francesca] Univ Pisa, Dept Chem & Ind Chem, UdR INSTM Pisa, Via G Moruzzi 13, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Parrini, Gianluca] Fabr Machinale, Via Giuntini 13, I-56021 Pisa, Italy	University of Pisa	Puppi, D (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Chem & Ind Chem, UdR INSTM Pisa, Via G Moruzzi 13, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.	dario.puppi@unipi.it	Puppi, Dario/I-4008-2012	Puppi, Dario/0000-0002-9251-4388	Randa Ishak and the Centre for Instrumentation Sharing (CISUP), University of Pisa, are acknowledged for SEM analysis.; Centre for Instrumentation Sharing; University of Pisa	Randa Ishak and the Centre for Instrumentation Sharing (CISUP), University of Pisa, are acknowledged for SEM analysis.; Centre for Instrumentation Sharing; University of Pisa	Randa Ishak and the Centre for Instrumentation Sharing (CISUP), University of Pisa, are acknowledged for SEM analysis.		39	0	0	0	0	WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH	WEINHEIM	POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY	1022-1352	1521-3935		MACROMOL CHEM PHYS	Macromol.

Additive manufacturing is considered a digital manufacturing technique that is rapidly transforming the medical space in terms of printing distinctive body parts with complex shapes and proposing customized and tailored resolutions to individual patients. In previous times, Additive Manufacturing (AM) is employed as a flexible and profitable technique for fabricating geometrically intricate medical organs, dental implants, and bones. Though patient-specific implants for bone disease, injury, and organ replacement are still a significant challenge for medical practitioners and researchers. In spite of the broad studies which were concluded on the characteristics of AM materials, there is still a necessity for a vigorous understanding of application-specific needs, processes, challenges, and considerations related to these techniques. Thus, the aim of this study is to present a comprehensive review of the most general AM processes, types of materials employed in AM, and applications of various AM techniques in the biomedical field. This study also outlines current limitations and challenges, which inhibit medical sciences to completely benefiting from the advanced AM opportunities, comprising production volume, post-processing, standards compliance, product quality, materials range, and maintenance.

Specifically, for the first time, rPET water bottle flake is processed using only an open source toolchain with Fused Particle Fabrication (FPF) or Fused Granular Fabrication (FGF) processing rather than first converting it to filament. In this study, first the impact of granulation, sifting, and heating (and their sequential combination) is quantified on the shape and size distribution of the rPET flakes. Then 3D printing tests were performed on the rPET flake with two different feed systems: an external feeder and feed tube augmented with a motorized auger screw, and an extruder-mounted hopper that enables direct 3D printing. Two Gigabot X machines were used, each with the different feed systems, and one without and the latter with extended part cooling. 3D print settings were optimized based on thermal characterization, and both systems were shown to 3D print rPET directly from shredded water bottles. Mechanical testing showed the importance of isolating rPET from moisture and that geometry was important for uniform extrusion. The mechanical strength of 3D-printed parts with FPF and inconsistent flow is lower than optimized fused filament, but adequate for a wide range of applications. Future work is needed to improve consistency and enable water bottles to be used as a widespread DRAM feedstock.

This study included 12 different anatomical structures of the mandible, which were obtained during the process of reconstructing data from the Siemens Somatom Sensation Open 40 system. The manufacturing process used for the 12 structures involved the use of 8 3D printers and 12 different polymer materials. Verification of the accuracy and radiological density was performed with the CT160Xi Benchtop tomography system. The most accurate results were obtained in the case of models manufactured using the following materials: E-Model (Standard Deviation (SD) = 0.145 mm), FullCure 830 (SD = 0.188 mm), VeroClear (SD = 0.128 mm), Digital ABS-Ivory (SD = 0.117 mm), and E-Partial (SD = 0.129 mm). In the case of radiological density, ABS-M30 was similar to spongious bone, PC-10 was similar to the liver, and Polylactic acid (PLA) and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were similar to the spleen. Acrylic resin materials were able to imitate the pancreas, kidney, brain, and heart. The presented results constitute valuable guidelines that may improve currently used radiological phantoms and may provide support to surgeons in the process of performing more precise treatments within the mandible area.

These, together with their biocompatibility makes them ideal candidates for tissue engineering (TE) applications. Additive manufacturing is an ideal biofabrication approach for TE, providing rapid and reliable technologies to produce scaffolds aimed for the guidance of host or implanted cells to form functional tissues. However, the control of parameters at the nanoscale that regulate cellular functions such as proliferation and differentiation remain challenging. This review article presents the latest advances in the use of CNMs as platforms to guide cellular functions in additive manufactured scaffolds. Special attention is given to functionalization routes, methods to exploit them as topographical cues and to improve the local mechanical properties together with the resulting cell-CNM interactions.

A 3D Printed Morphing Nozzle to Control Fiber Orientation during Composite Additive Manufacturing	ADVANCED MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						3D printing; 4D printing; additive manufacturing; direct ink writing	SOFT MATTER	Fiber-filled composite materials offer a unique pathway to enable new functionalities for systems built via extrusion-based additive manufacturing (or "3D printing"); however, challenges remain in controlling the fiber orientations that govern ultimate performance. In this work, a multi-material, shape-changing nozzle-constructed by means of PolyJet 3D printing-is presented that allows for the spatial distribution of short fibers embedded in polymer matrices to be modulated on demand throughout extrusion-based deposition processes. Specifically, the nozzle comprises flexible bladders that can be inflated pneumatically to alter the geometry of the material extrusion channel from a straight to a converging-diverging configuration, and in turn, the directional orientation of fibers within printed filaments. Experimental results for printing carbon microfiber-hydrogel composites reveal that increasing the nozzle actuation pressure from 0 to 100 kPa reduced the proportion of aligned fibers, and notably, prompted a transition from anisotropic to isotropic water-induced swelling properties (i.e., the ratio of transverse to longitudinal swelling strain decreased from 1.73 +/- 0.37 to 0.93 +/- 0.39, respectively). In addition, dynamically varying the nozzle geometry during the extrusion of continuous composite filaments effects distinct swelling behaviors in adjacent regions, suggesting potential utility of the presented approach for emerging "4D printing" applications.

J	Roy, M; Wodo, O				Roy, Mriganka; Wodo, Olga			Feature Engineering for Surrogate Models of Consolidation Degree in Additive Manufacturing	MATERIALS			English	Article						additive manufacturing; data-driven approach; fused filament fabrication	STRENGTH; FRAMEWORK; BEHAVIOR	Surrogate models (SM) serve as a proxy to the physics- and experiment-based models to significantly lower the cost of prediction while providing high accuracy. Building an SM for additive manufacturing (AM) process suffers from high dimensionality of inputs when part geometry or tool-path is considered in addition to the high cost of generating data from either physics-based models or experiments. This paper engineers features for a surrogate model to predict the consolidation degree in the fused filament fabrication process. Our features are informed by the physics of the underlying thermal processes and capture the characteristics of the part's geometry and the deposition process. Our model is learned from medium-size data generated using a physics-based thermal model coupled with the polymer healing theory to determine the consolidation degree. Our results demonstrate high accuracy (>90%) of consolidation degree prediction at a low computational cost (four orders of magnitude faster than the numerical model).

This work compares the print capabilities of a custom-made VAP printer to those of an established commercial printer using polymer clay. Characterization tests were conducted comparing the two methods in their turning quality. In addition, a variety of other shapes were printed by both printers to evaluate feature resolution, unsupported overhang angle, negative space feature construction, and less-than-fully-dense self-supported 3D lattices. The porosity and regularity of the printed lattices were characterized using X-ray microtomography (MicroCT) scans. The quality of the shapes was compared using statistical methods and a MATLAB edge-finding code. The results show that the VAP printer can manufacture parts of superior resolution than the commercial printer due to its ability to extrude highly viscous material through a smaller nozzle diameter. The VAP print speeds were also found to be as high as twenty times those of the direct write printer. This work lays the foundation for leveraging AM in the printing of highly loaded or viscous shear-thinning inks as a means of improving their final quality.

To understand the correlation between process and material parameters and to enable digital modeling of EAM, the effect of different substrate temperatures and layer heights on tensile strength was investigated. A simple testing methodology for pelletized carbon fiber-filled polyamide 6 was developed. Tensile tests were performed in a full factorial Design of Experiments (DoE) to determine the tensile properties. For bulk simulation, the nominal strength and modulus were also determined based on contact width obtained by optical microscopy. The results demonstrated high anisotropy, with the maximum transverse tensile strength reaching only 27% of the corresponding longitudinal results and the transverse tensile modulus reaching only 20% of its longitudinal value. The effects of varying layer height were less significant than varying substrate temperature. The results support the hypothesis that sufficient transverse tensile strength is achieved between the extrapolated crystallization onset and melt temperature. The methodology of this study can be used as a benchmark method to qualify new thermoplastic polymers for EAM processes and to determine optimal process parameters for improved fusion bonding.

Asymmetric metal-dielectric-metal structures were sequentially deposited with nickel, zinc oxide, and a thin copper layer to form an optical cavity. The color response was precisely adjusted by tuning the zinc oxide (ZnO) thickness using ALD, which was consistent with model predictions. Owing to the conformal nature of ALD, this allows for uniform and tunable coloration of nonplanar three-dimensional (3D) objects, as exemplified by adding color to 3D-printed parts produced by metal additive manufacturing. Proper choice of inorganic layered structures and materials allows the structural color to be stable at elevated temperatures, in contrast to traditional paints. To print multiple colors on a single sample, polymer inhibitors were patterned in a desired geometry using electrohydrodynamic jet (e-jet) printing, followed by area-selective ALD in the unpassivated regions. The ability to achieve 3D color printing, both at the micro- and macroscales, provides a new pathway to tune the optical and aesthetic properties during additive manufacturing.

Another burgeoning technology, additive manufacturing (3D printing), can contribute significantly to this approach by offering a high degree of design freedom. In this study, we investigated the use of commercially available 3D printable polymer materials as the MFC membrane and anode. The best performing membrane material, Gel-Lay, produced a maximum power of 240 +/- 11 mu W, which was 1.4-fold higher than the control CEM with PMAX of 177 +/- 29 mu W. Peak power values of Gel-Lay (133.8-184.6 mu W) during fed-batch cycles were also higher than the control (133.4-160.5 mu W). In terms of material cost, the tested membranes were slightly higher than the control CEM, primarily due to the small purchased quantity. Finally, the first 3D printable polymer anode, a conductive PLA material, showed significant potential as a low-cost and easy to fabricate MFC anode, producing a stable level of power output, despite poor conductivity and relatively small surface area per unit volume. These results demonstrate the practicality of monolithic MFC fabrication with individually optimised components at relatively low cost. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Jansson, A; Pejryd, L				Jansson, Anton; Pejryd, Lars			Characterisation of carbon fibre-reinforced polyamide manufactured by selective laser sintering	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Computed tomography; Carbon fibre-reinforced polymer; Selective laser sintering; Additive manufacturing		Polymers and reinforced plastics are employed in various load-bearing applications, from household objects to aerospace products. These materials are light, strong, and relatively cheap but can be difficult to form into complex geometries. However, the development of additive manufacturing processes has made it easier to manufacture reinforced plastics in complex shapes. The aim of this work was to study the internal features and mechanical properties of carbon fibre-reinforced polyamide (CF/PA12) fabricated with the additive manufacturing technique of selective laser sintering. The test specimens were studied using computed tomography to analyse the internal geometry, and the material proved to be highly porous. Moreover, the test specimens revealed an internal layered structure, which was found to have a great effect on the tensile properties of the material. The results highlight that there is room for further optimisation of the manufacturing parameters for CF/PA12, because the layered structure makes it challenging to design end user parts with acceptable mechanical properties.

Polymer-inorganic hybrid colloids for ultraviolet-assisted direct ink write of polymer nanocomposites	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						UV-assisted direct ink write (UV-DIW) additive manufacturing; 3D printing; Polymer nanocomposite elastomer; Hybrid latex; Silica nanoparticles; Styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR)	EMULSION POLYMERIZATION; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; SILICA NANOPARTICLES; LATEX; FABRICATION; PARTICLES; EPOXY; COMPOSITE; BEHAVIOR	Inorganic-polymer hybrid colloids present a modular and tunable route to fabricate polymer nanocomposites from low viscosity precursors; however, their use in additive manufacturing remains limited. This manuscript describes photocurable "hybrid colloids" to enable layered fabrication of elastomeric nanocomposites, i.e., combination of continuous-phase photocrosslinking chemistry with hybrid colloids of water-dispersible silica nanoparticles and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) latex particles. Varying the relative concentrations of polymeric and inorganic particles afforded precise tuning of filler loading in the final nanocomposite and introduced a bimodal particle size distribution with desirable rheological behavior for extrusion-based additive manufacturing. Specifically, ultraviolet-assisted direct ink write (UV-DIW) processing of the photocurable hybrid colloid pastes generated free-standing green bodies, which contained a combination of SBR and silica nanoparticles. Subsequent drying of the green bodies allowed SBR particle coalescence and penetration through the scaffold and surrounding the silica nanoparticles, which yielded a semi-interpenetrating network (sIPN) nanocomposite. Facile tuning of silica concentrations in the hybrid colloid enabled tuning of both the colloidal ink rheology and mechanical properties of the final sIPN nanocomposites to achieve additive manufacturing of silica-SBR nanocomposites with ultimate tensile strains exceeding 300 % and ultimate tensile strengths above 10 MPa.

CRACK PROPAGATION AND FRACTURE TOUGHNESS OF ADDITIVELY MANUFACTURED POLYMERS	PROCEEDINGS OF ASME 2021 INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION (IMECE2021), VOL 4			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE)	NOV 01-05, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	Amer Soc Mech Engineers		Tensile properties; fatigue; additively manufactured polymers; finite element		Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies are catching the interest day by day due to their ability to produce very complex shapes or geometries. Investigating the fracture and fatigue behavior of additively manufactured parts are essential not only to understand their mechanical response but also to predict and prevent their failure. In this study, fracture and fatigue properties of additively manufactured polymers are investigated experimentally combining the servohydraulic material testing system (MTS 810) and the three-dimensional digital image correlation technology. The polymers used for the analysis are acrylonitrile styrene acrylate (ASA) and Onyx, which are readily available and more prevalent in AM applications. Both notched (i.e., pre-cracked) and unnotched specimens are printed in the edge and flat orientations by the fused deposition modeling printer in the shape of the standard ASTM sub-size flat dogbone structure. The tensile strain is studied ahead of the crack formation, and the crack propagation is observed in the photos obtained from the digital image correlation system. A finite element model of similar contemplation is generated for the validation and extended results. Results show that the orientation of manufacturing has a noticeable effect on the failure of the specimen. In the unnotched specimens, the crack occurs near the neck due to a high-stress concentration. Results for the high cycle fatigue test indicate that fatigue life decreases as the load increases for all types of specimens.	[Pulok, Mohammad Khairul Habib; Rahman, M.

J	Zlatanovic, DL; Hildebrand, J; Bergmann, JP				Zlatanovic, Danka Labus; Hildebrand, Jorg; Bergmann, Jean Pierre			The study of screw extrusion-based additive manufacturing of eco-friendly aliphatic polyketone	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-JMR&T			English	Article						Aliphatic polyketone; Extrusion -based additive; manufacturing; 3D printing	DEPOSITION; FIBER	Aliphatic polyketone is a new-age eco-friendly, high-performance engineering thermoplastic. However, its potential for replacing other polymers depends on its ability to be processed. Considering that the first aliphatic polyketone suitable for processing was developed relatively recently (2015), the material gained new research potential. In this paper screw extrusion-based process was developed for additive manufacturing of aliphatic polyketone. A detailed characterisation of the process and printed samples was done. It was shown that the extruder-base process can produce stable additivemanufactured parts depending on printing speed (process parameters). The interpass temperature has a significant influence on printing properties and it depends on printing speed (travel speed of building platform and extruder rotational speed). With the increase in the printing speed, the interpass temperature increases as well. If it is low causes insufficient heat for diffusion to occur causing delamination and if it is too high causes geometrical deviation of workpieces which leads to defects causing a reduction in interroad strength. The tensile strength of specimens with raster angle 0 degrees was 62.7 +/- 1.4 MPa, which is slightly higher than the tensile strength of base material guaranteed by the supplier (60 MPa) while the elongation up to the first crack was 32.8 +/- 4.6%. Iinter-road strength in specimens with a raster angle of 90 degrees was 37.2 +/- 0.8 MPa which is 62% of the base material while interpass temperature was 189 +/- 3.3 degrees C.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

The benefits of AM have led to recent interest in producing multifunctional materials capable of being printed with current AM technologies. In this article, piezoresistive composites realized by AM and the matrices and fillers utilized to make such devices are introduced and discussed. Carbon-based nanoparticles (Carbon Nanotubes, Graphene/Graphite, and Carbon Black) are often the filler choice of most researchers and are heavily discussed throughout this review in combination with extrusion AM methods.

The use of impellers in various applications is considered an integral part of the industry. So, increased performance and the optimization of impellers have been the center of attention of a lot of studies. In this regard, studies have been focused on the improvement of the efficiency of rotary machines through aerodynamic optimization, using high-performance materials and suitable manufacturing processes. As such, the use of polymers and polymer composites due to their lower weight when compared to metals has been the focus of studies. On the other hand, methods of the manufacturing process for polymer and polymer composite impellers such as conventional impeller manufacturing, injection molding and additive manufacturing can offer higher economic efficiency than similar metal parts. In this study, polymeric and polymer composites impellers are discussed and conclusions are drawn according to the manufacturing methods. Studies have shown promising results for the replacement of polymers and polymer composites instead of metals with respect to a suitable temperature range. In general, polymers showed a good ability to fabricate the impellers, however in more difficult working conditions considering the need for a substance with higher physical and mechanical properties necessitates the use of composite polymers. However, in some applications, the use of these materials needs further research and development.

Additive manufacturing techniques are expected to enable rapid prototyping of complex 3D architectonics required for such applications. We report the fabrication of highly fluorescent all-organic metastructures via carbon quantum dot assisted in-situ polymerization of acrylate and carbon dot composite resin. The polymerized structures fabricated from acrylate and carbon dot composite resin exhibit excellent linear and nonlinear optical properties due to the presence of two-photon active carbon quantum dots incorporated in the resin. By activating the two-photon process, we eliminated the need for adding two-photon absorbing toxic chemicals for initiating the polymerization process. The fabrication of functional nanostructures using acrylate and carbon dot composite resin opens the door for rapid prototyping of metastructures for various applications such as developing functional metamaterials, solid-state lighting, live monitoring of cells in cultures, fluorescent tagging and detection of counterfeiting among others.

Two new design targets are addressed by our approach: Oil-free operation is achieved by innovative coating of gear teeth which enables almost maintenance-free operation. Furthermore, a higher damping of sound transmission from tooth mesh to bearings is implemented by an optimal wheel body geometry that is realized by a combination of printable carbon-containing polymers (flange) and steel (gear rim). The innovative approach is to extend components by areas that cannot be produced by milling and casting, e.g. complex structures, contour-following fluid-carrying cooling elements by means of LBM, thus creating a significant benefit compared to state-of-the-art gearboxes. Function integration made possible by additive manufacturing results in a very high component complexity. It is combined with gear grinding and final ta-C coatings ensuring maximum efficiency in dry operation, to achieve economically viable production processes. The increase in tooth mesh efficiency is achieved by optimization approaches in the design to minimize heat losses while at the same time maintaining highest possible strength and lowest noise emission.

This growing interest is driven by the reduction of costs, environmental impact, energy consumption, and the possibility to increase the range of printable materials. Pellet additive manufacturing (PAM) can cover the same applications as fused filament fabrication (FFF), and in addition, can lead to scale towards larger workspaces that cannot be covered by FFF, due to the limited diameters of standard filaments. In the first case, the process is known as micro- or mini-extrusion (MiE) in the literature, in the second case the expression big area additive manufacturing (BAAM) is very common. Several models are available in literature regarding filament extrusion, while there is a lack of modeling of the extrusion dynamics in PAM. Physical and chemical phenomena involved in PAM have high overlap with those characterizing injection molding (IM). Therefore, a systematic study of IM literature can lead to a selection of the most promising models for PAM, both for lower (MiE) and larger (BAAM) extruder dimensions. The models concerning the IM process have been reviewed with this aim: the extraction of information useful for the development of codes able to predict thermo-fluid dynamics performances of PAM extruders.

Space Qualification of Metalized Additive Manufactured Filters	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Vibrations; Temperature measurement; Filters; Satellite broadcasting; Performance evaluation; Payloads; Frequency measurement; Space communications; Filters; space qualification; multipactor; natural frequency; space communications; temperature; vibration; additive manufacturing		The space industry is seeking new solutions for the development of lightweight, inexpensive and easy-to-manufacture on-board communication payload devices. One of the proposed technologies is additive manufacturing (AM) of polymeric materials that are subsequently metallized. The devices developed using this technique must be operational in the particular space environment conditions. In this work we study the integrity of filters made by additive manufacturing against the extreme conditions of mechanical stress, temperature and power management as described in the standard of the European Space Agency (ESA) for satellite payload. To carry out this qualification for space, two types of X-band filters with identical frequency responses have been designed and manufactured: a classic H-plane waveguide cavities filter, and three filters on surface-mount technology (SMT). Two of the SMT filters are low height rectangular cavities filters, while the third one is a high circular cavities filter. This selection was intended to verify that the AM technique offered good results regardless of the devices topology. Two mechanical vibration tests were performed: sinusoidal sweep and random vibration. These tests emulate the transport and launching conditions of the satellite payload. Furthermore, it was measured the mechanical natural frequency of the filters, and its variation after being exposed to the tests in order to evaluate their physical integrity. The thermal analysis was performed emulating the temperature profile experienced by the satellite payload during working conditions. Then, the power handling tests were carried out. The secondary electron emission yield of the material (metallized polymer) was firstly measured. The power levels, location and frequency at which a multipactor discharge would occur were analyzed for both, low-height and standard-height, filters. Finally, both filters were subjected to those power levels, under high vacuum conditions, to check if the said multipactor discharges occurred. The mechanical stress and temperature tests prove that the developed filters can survive the hard launching and operation conditions of commercial satellite payloads. The multipactor tests report the high power levels that the devices can handle without risk of radiofrequency (RF) breakage. All these tests allow to fully qualify the proposed manufacturing technique for spatial applications.

In the present work, the capabilities of fused filament fabrication (FFF) to produce miniature lattices were explored, as they represent an inexpensive option for the production of polymer custom-made lattice structures. First, fused filament fabrication design guidelines were tested to assess their validity for miniature unit cells and lattice structures. The predictions were contrasted with the results of printing tests, showing some discrepancies between expected outcomes and resulting printed structures. It was possible to print functional 3D miniature open cell polymer lattice structures without support, even when some FFF guidelines were infringed, i.e., recommended minimum strut thickness and maximum overhang angle. Hence, a broad range of lattice structures with complex topologies are possible, beyond the cubic-type cell arrangements. Nevertheless, there are hard limits in 3D printing of miniature lattice structures. Strut thickness, length and orientation were identified as critical parameters in miniature lattice structures. Printed lattices that did not fully comply with FFF guidelines were capable of bearing compressive loads, even if surface quality and accuracy issues could not be fully resolved. Nevertheless, 3D printed FFF lattice structures could represent an improvement compared to other additive manufacturing processes, as they offer good control of cell geometry, and does not require additional post-processing.

J	Ham, S; Jeon, Y				Ham, Songhee; Jeon, Youngjoon			MD Simulation of PLA-PEG Composites for Additive Manufacturing	APPLIED CHEMISTRY FOR ENGINEERING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Poly-lactic acid; Polyethylene glycol; Molecular dynamics; Materials Studio		Poly-lactic acid (PLA) is the most promising polymer in additive manufacturing as an alternative to acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). Since it is produced from renewable resources such as corn starch and sugar beets, it is also biocompatible and biodegradable. However, PLA has a couple of issues that limit its use. First, it has a comparatively low glass transition temperature of around 60 & DEG;C, such that it exhibits low thermal resistance. Second, PLA has low impact strength because it is brittle. Due to these problems, scientists have found methods to improve the crystallinity and ductility of PLA. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is one of the most studied plasticizers for PLA to give it chain mobility. However, the blend of PLA and PEG becomes unstable, and phase separation occurs even at room temperature as PEG is self-crystallized. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the optimal mixing ratio of PLA-PEG at the molecular scale. In this study, molecular dynamics will be conducted with various ratios of L-type PLA (PLLA) or DL-type PLA-PEG (PDLA-PEG) systems by using BIOVIA Materials Studio.

Enhancing the bearing strength of woven carbon fibre thermoplastic composites through additive manufacturing	COMPOSITE STRUCTURES			English	Article						Carbon fibre; Thermoplastic; Additive manufacturing; Bearing response; Continuous fibre	POLYMER COMPOSITES; GLASS; SIZE	This paper examines a novel additive manufacturing (AM) technique for the fabrication of woven multilaminate composites. The printing studies were carried out using nylon coated carbon fibre Tow in the form of a filament. This pathing technique allows for a woven structure to be integrated with features (such as notches) previously only possible through destructive machining processes. In order to evaluate the performance of these printed composites, bearing response studies were carried out 6 mm holes were routed into a multilaminate woven composite structure, the resulting part's mechanical performance was then tested and compared with specimens which had been drilled post printing. Specimen were comprised of 9 woven laminates stacked to form a 3.1 mm thick standardised test coupon for single and double shear testing (ASTM D5961) Current industry standard machining techniques result in fibre discontinuity and damage, this results in suboptimal mechanical performance of composite components. These new 'Tailor Woven' specimens achieved single shear bearing strengths of up to 214 MPa and double shear bearing strengths of up to 276 MPa. These values represent an increase of 29% and 63% respectively compared with equivalent composites in which the hole had been drilled.

A high deposition rate was achieved by the implementation of a single-screw extruder, which directly used thermoplastic pellets and continuous fiber tows as feedstock materials. Thus, the proposed method was also used as a large-scale additive manufacturing (LSAM) method for printing large-volume components. Using polylactic acid (PLA) pellets and continuous carbon fiber tows, the feasibility of the proposed AM method was investigated through printing LFRC samples and further demonstrated by fabricating large-volume components with complex geometries. The printed LFRC samples were compared with pure thermoplastic and continuous fiber reinforced composite (CFRC) counterparts via mechanical tests and microstructural analyses. With comparable flexural modulus, the flexural strength of the LFRC samples was slightly lower than that of the CFRC samples. An average improvement of 28% in flexural strength and 50% in flexural modulus were achieved compared to those of pure PLA parts, respectively. Discontinuous long carbon fibers, with an average fiber length of 20.1 mm, were successfully incorporated into the printed LFRC samples. The carbon fiber orientation, distribution of carbon fiber length, and dispersion of carbon fiber as well as porosity were further studied. The carbon fibers were highly oriented along the printing direction with a relatively uniformly distributed fiber reinforcement across the LFRC cross section. With high deposition rate (up to 0.8 kg/hr) and low material costs (<$10/kg), this study demonstrated the potentials of the proposed printing method in LSAM of high strength polymer composites reinforced with long carbon fibers.

An expandable feedstock filament was first made by incorporation of thermally expandable microspheres (TEMs) in the filament during the extrusion process. The material formulation and extrusion process were designed such that TEM expansion was suppressed during filament fabrication. Polylactic acid (PLA) was used as a model material, and filaments containing 2.0 wt % triethyl citrate and 0.0-5.0 wt % TEM were fabricated. Expandable filaments were then fed into a material extrusion additive manufacturing process to enable the in situ foaming of microcellular structures during layer deposition. The mesostructure, cellular morphology, thermal behavior, and mechanical properties of the printed foams were investigated. Repeatable foam prints with highly uniform cellular structures were successfully achieved. The part density was reduced with an increase in the TEM content, with a maximum reduction of 50% at 5.0 wt % TEM content. It is also remarkable that the interbead gaps of mesostructure vanished due to the local polymer expansion during in situ foaming. The incorporation of TEM and plasticizer only slightly lowered the critical temperatures of PLA, that is, glass-transition, melting, and decomposition temperatures. Moreover, with the introduction of foaming, the specific tensile strength and modulus decreased, whereas the ductility and toughness increased severalfold. The results unveil the feasibility of a novel additive manufacturing technology that offers numerous opportunities toward the manufacturing of specially designed structures including functionally graded foams for a variety of applications.

Even though these processes have excellent capabilities to fabricate parts with cellular mesostructures, there exist several constraints in the processes and applications: limited selection of materials, high thermal stress by the high local energy source, poor surface finish, and anisotropic properties of parts caused by combined effects of one-dimensional (1D) energy based patterning mechanism, the deposition layer thickness, powder size, power and travel speed of laser or electron beam. In addition, manufacturing cost is still high with the Direct-metal AM processes. As an alternative for manufacturing metallic 3D cellular structures, which can overcome the disadvantages of direct-metal AM techniques, polymer AM methods may be combined with metal casting. We may call this "Indirect AM based Casting (I AM casting)". The objective of this study is to explore the potential of I AM Casting associated with development of a novel manufacturing process - Indirect 3D Printing based centrifugal casting which is capable of producing multifunctional metallic cellular structures with internal cooling channels having a 2mm inner diameter and 0.5mm wall thickness. We characterize polymers by making expendable patterns with a polyj et type 3D printer; e.g., modulus, strength, melting and glass transition temperatures and thermal expansion coefficients. A transient flow and heat transfer analysis of molten metal through 3D cellular network mold will be conducted. Solidification of molten metal through cellular mold during casting will be simulated with temperature dependent properties of molten metal and mold over a range of running temperatures. The volume of fluid (VOF) method will be implemented to simulate the solidification of molten metal together with a user defined function (UDF) of ANSYS/FLUENT. Finally, experimental validation will be conducted.

B	McDonald, J		Devine, DM		McDonald, John			Regulatory Considerations for Devices Manufactured Using Additive Manufacturing Technologies	POLYMER-BASED ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING: BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Book Chapter						Regulatory; CE marking; Custom medical devices; Regulatory guidance		This chapter reviews the regulatory framework for medical devices manufactured using additive manufacturing technologies in various countries and regions. The medical device regulations and guidelines published by these countries stipulate the specific regulatory requirements which medical device manufacturers must fulfil in order to bring their devices into the market. This chapter reviews the current regulations concerning, in particular, CE marking and US FDA regulation, and provides an overview of the Australian, Canadian, Brazilian and Japanese regulations. The review discusses routes of conformity for medical devices, device classification requirements and considerations when making changes to mass-produced medical devices. The methods which manufacturers can use to bring devices, such as custom-made medical devices, to the market will also be outlined. The review found that a regulatory framework currently exists to bring devices manufactured using additive manufacturing technologies to market. This framework, however, is more evolved in some countries in comparison to others, in particular, in relation to testing considerations for devices manufactured using such practices. Additionally, clarity would prove beneficial for manufacturers in relation to, for example, specific regulatory guidance documents from the regulatory authorities.

The production of AM parts with consistent and predictable properties requires input materials (e.g., metal powders) with known and repeatable characteristics, which in turn requires standardized measurement methods for powder properties. First, based on our previous work, we assess the applicability of current standardized methods for powder characterization for metal AM powders. Then we present the results of systematic studies carried out on two different powder materials used for additive manufacturing: stainless steel and cobalt-chrome. The characterization of these powders is important in NIST efforts to develop appropriate measurements and standards for additive materials and to document the property of powders used in a NIST-led additive manufacturing material round robin. An extensive array of characterization techniques was applied to these two powders, in both virgin and recycled states. The physical techniques included laser diffraction particle size analysis, X-ray computed tomography for size and shape analysis, and optical and scanning electron microscopy. Techniques sensitive to structure and chemistry, including X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive analytical X-ray analysis using the X-rays generated during scanning electron microscopy, and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy were also employed. The results of these analyses show how virgin powder changes after being exposed to and recycled from one or more Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) additive manufacturing build cycles. In addition, these findings can give insight into the actual additive manufacturing process.	[Slotwinski, J.

In particular, the realization of prototypes or the possibility to realize directly the product without customized tools can be allowed with less time consuming by additive manufacturing instead of conventional techniques. The present research aims at investigating the effect of a complex geometry on dimensional and surface quality of a component made by additive manufacturing of UV treatable polymers by a poly-jet system. A semi-ellipsoid surface was generated on two main B-spline lines realized with different curvatures using six control points each. The CAD information was converted into a STL and a slicing interval less than 0.05 mm applied. The effect of the two building directions imposed to the nozzle with respect to the two main profiles of the surface was evaluated in terms of surface waviness and staircase. Due to the complexity of the geometry, the shape information was detected by a 3D SCANNER. The shape of the photopolymerized model was in excellent agreement with that of CAD and the 3D SCANNER was able to detect waviness and staircase.

Hybridization of FFF and metal injection moulding enables sustainable and cost-efficient additive manufacturing of complex parts. Being a hybrid process, it involves optimization of various interlinked parameters; for this reason, the present review deliberately provides analysis of consolidated and comparative information of research work previously carried out for this process. As conclusively perceived, the present perspective of this review provides an approach of incorporating FFF-based hybrid AM technique, with benefits such as reduced capital expenditure, ease in processing and ability to manufacture parts from distinct variety of materials like metals, ceramics, polymers, etc., using the same setup.

Within this contribution a novel approach for production of semi-crystalline polycarbonate (PC) micron-sized particles is presented. The PC particles produced by liquid-liquid phase separation are thoroughly characterized with respect to powder and material properties using laser diffraction particle sizing, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-Ray diffraction (XRD). Remarkably, starting from amorphous feed material the process allows to obtain spherical semi-crystalline PC particles opening a thermal 'process window' for selective laser sintering. Dry particle coating with fumed silica further improves the flowability of the product particles. The powders' SLS processability was assessed by tensile strength measurements and powder deposition experiments, Dense thin layer specimen could be successfully built using the novel PC powder.

However, the thickness of light-harvesting layer for all polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) is often limited to about 100 nm due to the dramatically decreased fill factor upon increasing film thickness, which hampers the light harvesting capability to increase the power conversion efficiency, and is unfavorable for fabricating large-area devices. Here we demonstrate that by tuning the bulk heterojunction morphology using a non-halogenated solvent, cyclopentyl methyl ether, in the presence of a green solvent additive of dibenzyl ether, the power conversion efficiency of all-PSCs with photoactive layer thicknesses of over 500 nm reached an impressively high value of 9%. The generic applicability of this green solvent additive to boost the power conversion efficiency of thick-film devices is also validated in various bulk heterojunction active layer systems, thus representing a promising approach for the fabrication of all-PSCs toward industrial production, as well as further commercialization.

Recently, numerous commercial AM machines for metallic materials have been developed. The primary types of AM using metallic materials are powder bed fusion or direct energy deposition. Other types using metallic materials have not been adequately studied. In this study, the use of the material extrusion (ME) type of AM is investigated. The aim is to use metallic materials not only for fabricating metal parts but also for adding various properties to base materials, e.g., electric conductivity, thermal conductivity, weight, strength, and color of plastics. ME is appropriate for use with various materials by mixing different types of filler. However, there is a problem in that the high density of metal fillers generates unstable extrusion. Therefore, ultrasonic vibration was used for assisting extrusion. A prototype system was developed using an extrusion nozzle vibrated by an ultrasonic homogenizer. The experimental results showed that the ultrasonic vibration allows materials to be extruded smoothly. Three dimensional (3D) shapes could be built by multi-layer deposition with a thixotropic polymer containing a highly concentrated steel powder. As one application, a 3D-shaped object was fabricated as a sintered object. After the vibration effect in the extrusion process of steel powder and clay was confirmed, a 3D object built by the proposed method was sintered through a baking process.

The paper describes a new approach for design manufacturing of complex three dimensional components building on a combination of digital manufacturing technologies such as laminated objects manufacturing, laser and e-printing technologies. The micro component is made up of stacks of functionalized layers of polymer films. The concept is currently developed further in the project SMARTLAM [2,3], funded by the European Commission. The manufacturing system is based on a flexible, scalable and modular equipment and application features approach which enables the manufacturing of different small size batches without tool or mask making in short time. Different modules can be combined by defined hardware and software interfaces. Avoiding time consumable and difficult programming caused by manufacturing a new conceptual approach a Function-Block Runtime (FORTE) executes generated control application platform-independently and coordinates component module functionalities. The control system is designed to integrate all processes as well as the base platform with features far beyond ordinary PLC systems. One aspect is the use of process data out of the data acquisition system to simulate and optimize the processes. These results are incorporated into the main machine control system. Another aspect is the vision system for flexible quality control and closed loop positioning control with visual servoing. The paper shows the overall concept of SMARTLAM and exemplarily demonstrates the control system as well as the modular equipment approach by the example of the control system for alignment of different stacks and inspection system.

Byron			Development and validation of extrusion deposition additive manufacturing process simulations	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						3D-Printing; Process simulation; Finite element analysis (FEA); Polymer-matrix composites (PMCs)	STRESSES	The process simulation tool Additive3D has been developed in Abaqus(C) 2017 to model the Extrusion Deposition Additive Manufacturing (EDAM) process for fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites. This additive manufacturing (AM) method encompasses material deposition processes where geometries are constructed layer by layer and the resulting layer properties are highly anisotropic. The goal is to predict final deformed shapes and residual stresses of printed geometries due to the printing process and the material anisotropy. The resulting design tool allows to assess the outcomes of the printing process based on the part geometry, the printing material and the position control parameters. Material properties were characterized, and validation experiments, without additional calibration, show an excellent agreement between modeled and measured part deformation states with relative deviations below 7%. Due to the physics-based nature of the developed simulation tools, the simulations can be extended to account for different part scales, printing materials and printing histories.

J	Miseljic, M; Olsen, SI				Miseljic, M.; Olsen, S. I.			Life Cycle Assessment of Functionally Enhanced Polymers-Engineered Nanomaterials or Conventional Additives?	JOURNAL OF NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Life Cycle Assessment; Engineered Nanomaterials; Impact Assessment; Nanoproducts; Manufacturing; Polymers; Additives	IMPACT	Engineered nanomaterials, where at least one dimension is within 1-100 nm, are produced and used in many consumer products, with the purpose of enhancing specific material properties (e. g., in plastic products). Conventionally, organic and inorganic non-engineered nanomaterial additives are also used to enhance material properties. The aim of this study is to perform life cycle assessments (LCAs) on 5 polymer products (polypropylene air-conditioner part for cars, polypropylene garden chair, polypropylene small electrical box for houses, polyvinylchloride-wood outdoor flooring and polystyrene insulation panels for buildings). Antibacterial, ultraviolet ray protection or flame retardancy properties of these products have been improved through the addition of either Ag, ZnO or Mg(OH)(2) engineered nanomaterials, or conventional organic/inorganic polymer additives. The study also presents new industrial production inventories of the considered engineered nanomaterials as well as the quantification of potential changes in impacts when the LCA functional unit is adjusted according to material functionality (antibacterial, ultraviolet-protection and flame retardancy). The LCA results show that in all cases the products with engineered nanomaterials generate higher potential environmental impacts than products with conventional additives. However, when considering the improved material functionality results differ more. The polyvinylchloride-wood outdoor flooring and polystyrene insulation panels for buildings with engineered nanomaterials perform better than with the use of conventional additives, while the polypropylene products with engineered nanomaterials have slightly higher environmental impacts than products with conventional additives. In the case of polypropylene small electrical box the needed large content of micro-Mg(OH)(2) makes the engineered nanomaterial case far less favourable, but if Mg(OH)(2) substitutes halogenated flame retardants the potential toxicological impacts are shown to be significantly lower. This study shows that the consideration of enhanced material functionality in LCA can favour some of the engineered nanomaterial based products, versus conventional additives, by reflecting the potential increase in use quality and potentially the use time. Also in this study, based on assumed release amounts, freshwater ecotoxicity caused by engineered nanomaterial release from products is quantifiedshowing a novel approach.	[Miseljic, M.; Olsen, S.

Composites and in particular fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) are increasingly present in concrete reinforcement. Their corrosion resistance, high tensile strength, low weight, and high flexibility offer an interesting alternative to conventional steel reinforcement, especially with respect to their use in Concrete 3D Printing. This paper presents an initial development of a dynamic robot-based manufacturing process for FRP concrete reinforcement as an innovative way to increase shape freedom and efficiency in concrete construction. The focus here is on prefabricated fiber reinforcement, which is concreted in a subsequent additive process to produce load-bearing components. After the presentation of the fabrication concept for the integration of FRP reinforcement and the state of the art, a requirements analysis regarding the mechanical bonding behavior in concrete is carried out. This is followed by a description of the development of a dynamic fiber winding process and its integration into an automated production system for individualized fiber reinforcement.

The parts produced possess good strength, low weight, excellent mechanical properties and are cost-effective. This saves a considerable amount of both time and carrying cost. Thereof the challenges and opportunities that the space sector holds for AM is worth reviewing to provide a better insight into further developments and prospects for this technology. Design/methodology/approach The potentiality of 3D printing for the manufacturing of various components under space conditions has been explained. Here, the authors have reviewed the details of manufactured parts used for zero gravity missions, subjected to onboard International Space Station conditions and with those manufactured on earth. Followed by the major opportunities in 3D printing in space which include component repair, material characterization, process improvement and process development along with the new designs. The challenges such as space conditions, availability of power in space, the infrastructure requirements and the quality control or testing of the items that are being built in space are explained along with their possible mitigation strategies. Findings These components are well comparable with those prepared on earth which enables a massive cost saving. Other than the onboard manufacturing process, numerous other components and a complete robot/satellite for outer space applications were manufactured by AM. Moreover, these components can be recycled on board to produce feedstock for the next materials. The parts produced in space are bought back and compared with those built on earth. There is a difference in their nature i.e. the flight specimen showed a brittle nature and the ground specimen showed a denser nature. Originality/value The review discusses the advancements of 3D printing in space and provides numerous examples of the applications of 3D printing in space and space applications. The paper is solely dedicated to 3D printing in space. It provides a breakthrough in the literature as a limited amount of literature is available on this topic. The paper aims at highlighting all the challenges that AM faces in the space sector and also the future opportunities that await development.

To address this limitation, a flexible AM platform for big plastic objects has been realized mounting an industrial screw-based extruder on an anthropomorphic robot. An experimental campaign has been performed to set a suitable range of relevant process parameters, with the aim of ensuring a regular deposited layer geometry. Moreover, a closed-loop control strategy has been developed to correct the robot height based on data measured during the material deposition, thus further improving the process parameter setting and compensating the material shrinkage or other unexpected defects. Eventually, an online re-slicing algorithm has been implemented to preserve the desired height of the manufactured object, despite the layer height changes. The proposed approach allows a deposition flow rate up to 1250 cm(3)/h within a building volume limited only by the robot workspace.

J	Stiles, A; Tison, TA; Pruitt, L; Vaidya, U				Stiles, Alex; Tison, Thomas-Allan; Pruitt, Liam; Vaidya, Uday			Photoinitiator Selection and Concentration in Photopolymer Formulations towards Large-Format Additive Manufacturing	POLYMERS			English	Article						large scale; large format; additive manufacturing; photopolymer; photobleaching; BAPO	DIMETHACRYLATE OLIGOMER; TEMPORAL EVOLUTION; UV INTENSITY; POLYMERIZATION; KINETICS; CURE; TEMPERATURE; CONVERSION; STRENGTH; DEPTH	Photopolymers are an attractive option for large-format additive manufacturing (LFAM), because they can be formulated from structural thermosets and cure rapidly in ambient conditions under low-energy ultraviolet light-emitting diode (UV LED) lamps. Photopolymer cure is strongly influenced by the depth penetration of UV light, which can be limited in the 2-4 mm layer thicknesses typical of LFAM. Photoinitiator (PI) systems that exhibit photobleaching have proven useful in thick-section cure applications, because they generate a photoinitiation wavefront, but this effect is time-dependent. This study investigates the light transmission and through-thickness cure behavior in (meth)acrylate photopolymer formulations with the photobleaching initiator bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphine oxide (BAPO). Utilizing an optical model developed by Kenning et al., lower concentrations (0.1 wt% to 0.5 wt%) of BAPO were predicted to yield rapid onset of photoinitiation. In situ cure measurements under continuous UV LED irradiation of 380 mW/cm(2) showed that a 0.1 wt% concentration of BAPO achieved peak polymerization rate within 2.5 s at a 3-mm depth. With only 1 s of irradiation at 1.7 W/cm(2) intensity, the 0.1 wt% BAPO formulation also achieved the highest level of cure of the formulas tested. For an irradiation dose of 5.5 J/cm(2) at a duration of 3.7 s, cured polymer specimens achieved a flexural strength of 108 MPa and a flexural modulus of 3.1 GPa. This study demonstrates the utility of optical modeling as a potential screening tool for new photopolymer formulations, primarily in identifying an upper limit to PI concentration for the desired cure depth. The results also show that photobleaching provides only a limited benefit for LFAM applications with short (1.0 s to 3.7 s) UV irradiation times and indicate that excess PI concentration can inhibit light transmission even under extended irradiation times up to 60 s.

Theoretical and experimental thermal performance analysis of an additively manufactured polymer compact heat exchanger	INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS IN HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER			English	Article						Compact heat exchanger; 3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Polymer heat exchanger; Selective laser sintering; Fused deposition modeling	SINKS	Compact heat exchangers are characterized by high heat transfer surface area per unit of volume, mainly used in applications where space and weight are restricted, present in the aerospace, automotive and naval sectors. The study of new technologies to produce compact heat exchangers has grown considerably in recent years. One of the technologies that presents a great potential for this application, and which has been little explored, is additive manufacturing. This work presents a feasibility analysis of additive manufacturing to produce polymer compact heat exchangers. Experimental tests in prototypes, using the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) technologies, were taken, aiming to evaluate the thermal and hydrodynamic behavior of the heat exchangers. They were tested with air at room temperature and water at high temperatures, over a wide Reynolds number range, from laminar to turbulent flow, comprising 150 experimental tests. Additionally, a mathematical model to predict the thermal behavior of the prototype was developed and validated experimentally, the theoretical and experimental heat transfer rate showed good agreement, with an average error of approximately 3.5%. Even with low thermal conductivity of the polymer, an overall heat transfer coefficient of 194 W/m(2)K was achieved.	[Hein, L. L.] Natl Inst Space Res, Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil; [Mortean, M.

Specimens with three different nozzle temperatures were in situ consolidated and tested in a three-point bending test. Computed tomography (CT) is used for a detailed analysis of the local material structure and resulting material porosity, thus the results can be put into context with process parameters. In addition, a highly curved test structure was fabricated that demonstrates the limits of the process and dependent fibre strand folding behaviours.

The pandemic created huge demand for relevant medical and personal protective equipment (PPE) and put unprecedented pressure on the healthcare system within a very short span of time. Moreover, the supply chain system faced extreme disruption as a result of the frequent and severe lockdowns across the globe. In such a situation, additive manufacturing (AM) becomes a supplementary manufacturing process to meet the explosive demands and to ease the health disaster worldwide. Providing the extensive design customization, a rapid manufacturing route, eliminating lengthy assembly lines and ensuring low manufacturing lead times, the AM route could plug the immediate supply chain gap, whilst mass production routes restarted again. The AM community joined the fight against COVID-19 by producing components for medical equipment such as ventilators, nasopharyngeal swabs and PPE such as face masks and face shields. The aim of this article is to systematically summarize and to critically analyze all major efforts put forward by the AM industry, academics, researchers, users, and individuals. A step-by-step account is given summarizing all major additively manufactured products that were designed, invented, used, and produced during the pandemic in addition to highlighting some of the potential challenges. Such a review will become a historical document for the future as well as a stimulus for the next generation AM community.

Direct fabrication of bio-inspired gecko-like geometries with vat polymerization additive manufacturing method	JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING			English	Article						additive manufacturing; functional surfaces; biological features; micro manufacturing; polymer components; biomimetics	SURFACES; ADHESION; FORCE; WATER	Functional surfaces have proven their potential to solve many engineering problems, attracting great interest among the scientific community. Bio-inspired multi-hierarchical microstructures grant the surfaces with new properties, such as hydrophobicity, adhesion, unique optical properties and so on. The geometry and fabrication of these surfaces are still under research. In this study, the feasibility of using direct fabrication of microscale features by additive manufacturing (AM) processes was investigated. The investigation was carried out using a specifically designed vat photopolymerization AM machine-tool suitable for precision manufacturing at the micro dimensional scale which has previously been developed, built and validated at the Technical University of Denmark. It was shown that it was possible to replicate a simplified surface inspired by the Tokay gecko, the geometry was previously designed and replicated by a complex multi-step micromanufacturing method extracted from the literature and used as benchmark. Ultimately, the smallest printed features were analyzed by conducting a sensitivity analysis to obtain the righteous parameters in terms of layer thickness and exposure time. Moreover, two more intricate designs were fabricated with the same parameters to assess the surfaces functionality by its wettability. The surface with increased density and decreased feature size showed a water contact angle (CA) of 124 degrees +/- 0.10 degrees, agreeing with the Cassie-Baxter model. These results indicate the possibility of using precision AM for a rapid, easy and reliable fabrication method for functional surfaces.	[Davoudinejad, A.; Ribo, M. M.; Pedersen, D.

Additively Manufactured Polymer Composites for Superconducting Motor Coil Structures	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED SUPERCONDUCTIVITY			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; material properties; cryogenic polymers; HTS coils for motors		The Robinson Research Institute at Victoria University Wellington is building a series of superconducting motors over the next six years to demonstrate technology pathways for the transport industry, including aviation. Our target topology for these machines uses rotor-mounted superconducting field coils and a superconducting stator in an air-core configuration. To avoid eddy current heating in the stator cryostat, electrically conductive materials must be eliminated. At the same time, heat generated due to AC losses in the stator must be transferred efficiently and evenly from the superconductor to the cryo-coolant, in order to avoid localised film boiling. And finally, the coil structural support needs to closely match the thermal expansion characteristics of the superconductor wires and likely other G10 structural pieces to avoid debilitating stresses and lost support.In this study, we investigated the opportunity to use additively manufactured (AM) polymers with a range of filler materials as the structural support for a motor coil. A range of commercially available candidate materials have been identified and test coupons manufactured using either Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) or Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM). The material properties of the test coupons have been measured from room temperature down to cryogenic temperatures. This data was used to design, analyse and manufacture the support structure for a stator saddle-coil, and the coil wound with aluminium wire to simulate Conductor on Round Core (CORC) cable. Initial thermal cycle testing has been carried out to assess the performance of the composite.

It aims to foster exploitation of recycled Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers (rGFRPs) and recycled Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (rCFRPs) through two manufacturing workflows: indirect Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) and UV-assisted Direct Ink Writing (UV-DIW). An industrial case study on vehicle components has been considered by prototyping one real component. After the tensile tests, some molds were fabricated with a FFF 3D printer for the indirect 3D printing process to cast an epoxy-based thermosetting resin with rGFs and rCFs. The second technology consisted in fabricating the parts by hardening in-situ a photo- and thermal-curable thermosetting acrylic liquid resin with rGFs. These results validate the use of AM and recycled composites for applications in the automotive sector. These approaches may be implemented for customizable components for batches below 100 vehicles as the first step for their exploitation.

Until now conventional elastomers have not been widely used in the additive manufacturing process. The goal of our work was to determine the feasibility of additive manufacturing using ink jet printing of elastomeric latex materials. Particle size, viscosity, and surface tension were measured for five different latex materials-poly(2-chloro-1,3-butadiene), carboxylated styrene-butadiene rubber, carboxylated butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer, natural rubber, and prevulcanized natural rubber. The XSBR latex was predicted as the one most likely to be printable. Printing trials carried out with the XSBR as the ink proved it to be printable, although technical problems of agglomeration and print head clogging need to be addressed and both the material and process need to be optimized for consistent printing to be achieved.

With rapid innovations in 3-D printing technology and new filament materials, material vendors are offering specialty multifunctional metal-reinforced polymers with unique properties. Studies are necessary to understand the effects of filament composition, metal reinforcements, and print parameters on microstructure and mechanical behavior. In this study, densities, metal vol%, metal cross-sectional area %, and microstructure of various metal-reinforced Polylactic Acid (PLA) filaments were characterized by multiple methods. Comparisons are made between polymer microstructures before and after printing, and the effect of printing on the metal-polymer interface adhesion has been demonstrated. Tensile response and fracture toughness as a function of metal vol% and print height was determined. Tensile and fracture toughness tests show that PLA filaments containing approximately 36 vol% of bronze or copper particles significantly reduce mechanical properties. The mechanical response of PLA with 12 and 18 vol% of magnetic iron and stainless steel particles, respectively, is similar to that of pure PLA with a slight decrease in ultimate tensile strength and fracture toughness. These results show the potential for tailoring the concentration of metal reinforcements to provide multi-functionality without sacrificing mechanical properties.</p>	[Vakharia, Ved S.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, San Diego, CA 92092 USA; [Kuentz, Lily] Univ Oregon, Dept Geol, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Salem, Anton] VulcanForms Inc, Burlington, MA 01803 USA; [Halbig, Michael C.; Salem, Jonathan A.] NASA, Glenn Res Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44135 USA; [Singh, Mrityunjay] Ohio Aerosp Inst, Cleveland, OH 44142 USA	University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Oregon; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Glenn Research Center	Halbig, MC (corresponding author), NASA, Glenn Res Ctr, Cleveland, OH 44135 USA.; Singh, M (corresponding author), Ohio Aerosp Inst, Cleveland, OH 44142 USA.	ved.vakharia@gmail.com; lilykuentz@gmail.com; antonsalem1@gmail.com; michael.c.halbig@nasa.gov; jonathan.a.salem@nasa.gov; mrityunjaysingh@oai.org		Vakharia, Ved/0000-0002-7173-0145; Kuentz, Lily/0000-0001-5955-7514; Halbig, Michael/0000-0002-4345-2061	Lewis Educational and Research Collaborative Internship Project (LERCIP); NASA Pathways Program; Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology (RVLT) Project	Lewis Educational and Research Collaborative Internship Project (LERCIP); NASA Pathways Program; Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology (RVLT) Project	This research was supported by the Lewis Educational and Research Collaborative Internship Project (LERCIP), the NASA Pathways Program, and the Revolutionary Vertical Lift Technology (RVLT) Project.		37	11	11	4	28	MDPI	BASEL	ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND		2073-4360		POLYMERS-BASEL	Polymers	OCT	2021	13	20							3545	10.3390/polym13203545	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/polym13203545			16	Polymer Science	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Polymer Science	WS5MY	34685302	gold, Green Published			2023-12-06	WOS:000715226100001

In FDM, during solidification process, the extruded filament called as roads gets bonded with the adjacent roads forming a layer and hence the entire part. Time-dependent thermal behavior of the polymer material decides the structural integrity of the part that is manufactured. An attempt has been made to analyze the effect of temperature on bond formation. A new mathematical model is developed to relate time, temperature and the extent of bonding. Parts are manufactured at different extrusion temperatures, and tensile tests are conducted to evaluate the strength and its dependency on extrusion temperature. Fractured specimens are observed under scanning electron microscope to understand the bonding between the fused polymer roads. Results show good agreement between the proposed mathematical model and the experiment results.

C	Schiller, GJ			IEEE	Schiller, G. J.			Additive Manufacturing for Aerospace	2015 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 07-14, 2015	Big Sky, MT					Additive Manufacturing aka 3D printing opens up a whole new era for digital design and manufacturing. No longer is the aerospace engineering designer constrained by the ability to manufacture a component. The new philosophy is "if you can design it, we can produce it". Yet there is a laundry list of caveats with the current state of the technology especially as it applies to aerospace applications and in particular, launch vehicles. Use of polymer based materials has caught hold in production tooling, yet use of polymers and metals for actual flight applications faces challenges until the technology catches up with the specific needs of the Aerospace industry. Launch vehicle applications may prove to be the bounding arena for aerospace applications. Consider the need for perfection in quality, temperature extremes from cryogenic commodities to rocket engine exhaust, shock and vibration conditions, and the grand size. However, given the variety of exquisite designs and low volume, aerospace applications are well suited for Additive Manufacturing. The challenges of today are already being solved and incorporated into the technology of tomorrow. It is simply a matter of time before AM finds not only a foot hold in aerospace but becomes the manufacturing tool of choice.	[Schiller, G.

Thin-walled high temperature alloy structures fabricated from additively manufactured polymer templates	MATERIALS & DESIGN			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Electroplating; High temperature alloys; Rhenium alloys; Truss cores; Sandwich structures	CO-RE; INTERDIFFUSION; MECHANISMS; DESIGN	Additive manufacturing is enabling a paradigm shift in design and production, but conventional techniques reach their limits when metallic structures require walls with <0.5 mm thickness. Here we introduce an approach for indirect additive manufacturing of thin-walled alloy structures. First a polymer template is additively manufactured, then metal layers are deposited by electroplating, physical or chemical vapor deposition. After removal of the polymer, the metal layers can be interdiffused to form an alloy via homogenization heat treatments. Three different alloys designed for three elevated temperature regimes are demonstrated: Monel alloys based on Ni-Cu-Al-Ti, nickel superalloys based on Ni-Cr-Al and refractory rhenium alloys based on Re-Co. A process was developed to co-deposit rhenium and cobalt via aqueous electroplating, resulting in an alloy with a melting point of 2000 degrees C and a Vickers hardness of 480 +/- 50 HV0.2 after homogenization. Two applications of interest for the aerospace industry were chosen to demonstrate the technology. High temperature truss core sandwich structures and rocket engine thruster demos where fabricated.

As the number of applications realized in a rapid manufacturing (RM) approach grows, it is necessary to understand the process economics better when moving from laboratory and prototyping applications into the costsensitive production scale. This paper presents a production-centered economic assessment of DLP production in the early product development process, based on Continuous Liquid Interphase Printing (CLIP). It is applied to an automotive exterior part case study to reveal expected process economics and estimate part prime cost for different printer sizes and automation concepts. A subsequent sensitivity analysis assesses the influence of relevant cost drivers and identifies opportunities for further cost savings when producing end-use parts with DLP. Results may help machine OEMs and application developers in cost optimization and decision making in RM. (C) 2021 CIRP.

In this type of manufacturing process, objects are created from powder particles by adding layers of material upon one another through selectively melting particles from the powder bed. However, understanding the mechanical behavior of the powder during manufacturing as a function of material properties and particle shape is an essential pre-requisite for optimizing the production process. Here we develop a numerical tool for modeling the dynamics of powder particles during additive manufacturing based on force-based simulations by means of the Discrete Element Method (DEM). An existing DEM software (LIGGGHTS) is extended in order to study the transport of powder particles of complex geometric shapes through accounting for the boundary conditions inherent to the manufacturing process.

Laser additive manufacturing (LAM) could offer a new binder-free consolidation route, since it is capable of processing ceramics in a direct manner without post processing. However, laser processing of ceramics, especially high performance oxide ceramics, is limited by low thermal shock resistance, weak densification and low light absorptance at room temperature; particularly in the visible or near-infrared range. An extensive review focusing only on LAM (powder bed fusion - laser beam and directed energy deposition) of high performance oxide ceramics is currently lacking. This state-of-the-art review gives a detailed summary and critical analysis about process technologies, part properties, open challenges and process monitoring in the field of oxide ceramics. Improvements in accuracy and mechanical strength are proposed that could open LAM of oxide ceramics to new fields.

Non-destructive evaluation of additively manufactured polymer objects using X-ray interferometry	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Fused deposition modeling; X-ray interferometry; Dark-field; Curvature; Print defects	PHASE-CONTRAST; TOMOGRAPHY	X-ray interferometry provides a dark-field image, essentially a small-angle X-ray scattering image, of the voids and print defects in an additively manufactured polymer object. The interferometers used were tuned to scattering length 2-5 mu m and configured to measure scattering along both vertical and horizontal directions. The samples studied included Stanford Bunnies, fabricated from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA), and a quadratic test object fabricated from PLA. The dark-field projection images show orientation dependent X-ray scattering which is due to anisotropic voids and gaps at the filament-to-filament interface in these fused deposition modeling additive manufacturing objects. SEM corroborates the existence of gaps between filaments. The absorption and dark-field volumes are used to correlate printhead trajectory with print defect density. The absorption volume is used to generate perimeter points slice-by-slice, and from these points, the 2D curvature is calculated. There is a slight increase in X-ray scattering, hence print defect density, at regions with high curvature. Two X-ray interferometry techniques were used: stepped-grating and single-shot. As currently developed, stepped-grating has the larger field-of-view examination of an entire test object whilst single-shot has the potential for real-time, in situ measurement of the printing process within 1 mm of the printhead.

JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS			English	Article						Accuracy; Complete denture; Additive manufacturing; CAD-CAM; Polymers	DIMENSIONAL CHANGES; POLYMERS; DISINFECTION; ADAPTATION; EDENTULISM; STABILITY	Concepts for digital denture manufacturing are market-available but studies comparing the trueness of such dentures, either milled (MIL) or additive manufactured, compared to injection molded (IM) ones are still limited. Regarding the impact of artificial aging and microwave sterilization on this parameter, no data are available. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to assess the trueness of IM, MIL, and stereolithography (SLA) printed denture bases after manufacturing, hydrothermal cycling, and microwave sterilization. Sixteen edentulous maxillary plaster models were poured using a silicone mold and digitized by means of a desktop scanner. For group IM, 16 denture bases were injection molded using these models. For group MIL and SLA, the denture bases were virtually designed and manufactured referring to the digitized data. A total of 48 samples were scanned 1) after manufacturing, 2) after hydrothermal cycling (5-55 degrees C, N = 5,000), and after 3) three as well as 4) six cycles of microwave sterilization for 6 min each at 640 W. The 3D surface deviation of the total intaglio surface, the palate, the alveolar ridge, and the border seal region was evaluated on the basis of the root mean square estimation (RMSE) and positive and negative mean deviations with an inspection software. For statistical analysis, ANOVA and post hoc Tukey tests were performed (alpha = 0.05). MIL showed the lowest deviations of the total RMSE (P <= .006) compared with the scans of the plaster models. In comparison, IM showed increased, mainly positive, deviations (P = .006) at the border seal. SLA presented the highest total RMSE (P = .001) with increased negative deviations, likewise at the border seal. In contrast to SLA (P = .001), no differences between IM and MIL (P = .816) were measured after hydrothermal cycling. Following microwave sterilization, the trueness of SLA was higher compared to IM and MIL (P = .001), with no differences between MIL and IM (P = .153). Distortion of IM and MIL was measured after the 3rd cycle with no further changes observed thereafter (P >= .385). It can be concluded, that subtractive manufacturing of denture bases results in the highest trueness, followed by IM and SLA. In contrast to IM and SLA, hydrothermal cycling did not affect MIL. Solely SLA printed denture bases remained dimensionally stable after microwave sterilization.

Accelerating Fuel Cell Development with Additive Manufacturing Technologies: State of the Art, Opportunities and Challenges	FUEL CELLS			English	Review						Additive Manufacturing; Electrode Material; Energy Conversion; Fuel Cells; 3D Printing	ZIRCONIA DENSE ELECTROLYTE; BIPOLAR PLATES; ELECTRICITY-GENERATION; FUSED DEPOSITION; FLOW; FABRICATION; LAYERS; DESIGN; PLANAR; PERFORMANCE	In recent years, the use of additive manufacturing (AM) has been demonstrated in the fabrication of components in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell, solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), microbial fuel cell (MFC) and laminar flow-based fuel cell (LFFC). Various AM technologies have been successfully demonstrated in fuel cell manufacturing include material extrusion, powder bed fusion, vat photopolymerization and binder jetting. One of the unique advantages of AM is the ability to handle sophisticated design with features ranging from macro to micro scales, which are inaccessible by conventional manufacturing technologies. Well-designed complex 3D structures were reported to have the potential for increasing the performance of fuel cells. Therefore, AM presents itself as a promising fabrication method to promote the development of fuel cells. Besides, AM also showed its specialty in time-saving, flexibility, and on-demand manufacturability in the fabrication of fuel cell components. In spite of the prospects of AM in fuel cells, more studies and researches are required to overcome challenges, such as availability of material, manufacturing quality, and the costs.

J	Diaz-Garcia, A; Law, JY; Felix, M; Guerrero, A; Franco, V				Diaz-Garcia, Alvaro; Law, Jia Yan; Felix, Manuel; Guerrero, Antonio; Franco, Victorino			Functional, thermal and rheological properties of polymer-based magnetic composite filaments for additive manufacturing	MATERIALS & DESIGN			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Composites; Functional filaments; Soft magnetic materials	MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; ENTHALPY RELAXATION; POLY(LACTIC ACID); NANOCOMPOSITES; FLOW; FILMS; MELTS; SHAPE	The design of functional composite filaments for fused filament fabrication requires a suitable polymer composition, functionality of particles, uniform distribution of fillers throughout the filament, and adequate printability. Uniform distribution at predictable concentrations is achieved by designing polymeric capsules containing the fillers and using them as feedstock for extrusion. Functionality can be inferred from that of the particles and target concentration. However, suitable conditions for printing strongly depend on polymer type and characteristics/concentration of fillers. Soft magnetic composite filaments were produced from polylactic acid (PLA) capsules filled with 30-52 wt. % maraging steel particles. Composite filaments preserve the soft magnetic character of the fillers. Fillers reduce the transition temperatures of the polymer by ti 5 K and have a profound impact on printability. Rheological characterization shows that the "ball bearing effect" of gas-atomized particles reduces the viscosity of the composites by more than one order of magnitude, decreasing printing temperature from 215 degrees C to 170 degrees C, associated with the lack of agglomeration of particles achieved by the proposed production method. Rheological experiments allow to detect the required changes in printing conditions without requiring an extensive and costly trial and error process of printing with a large set of printing parameters.

J	Rimkus, A; Farh, MM; Gribniak, V				Rimkus, Arvydas; Farh, Mahmoud M.; Gribniak, Viktor			Continuously Reinforced Polymeric Composite for Additive Manufacturing-Development and Efficiency Analysis	POLYMERS			English	Article						additive manufacturing; polylactic acid; aramid fibers; continuous reinforcement; recycling; tensile tests	CARBON-FIBER; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; EXTRUSION; FABRICATION; PREDICTION; VIRGIN; GLASS	Additive manufacturing (AM) is a rapidly growing technology, referring to a 3D design process by which digital data builds a physical object in layers by depositing the printed material. The AM has evolved in the aviation, automotive, and medical industries. The AM development for fiber-reinforced composites is the point of current interest, with most research focused on using short fibers. However, notwithstanding particular technological complexities, continuous filaments have superior tensile properties compared to short fibers. Therefore, this manuscript develops an adaptive continuous reinforcement approach for AM based on polymeric material extrusion (ME) technology. It combines the raw material production process, including the ability to vary constituents (e.g., filament materials, reinforcement percentage, and recycled plastic replacement ratio), and the reinforcement efficiency analysis regarding the experimentally verified numerical model. The literature review has identified compatible materials for ensuring sustainable and high-performance plastic composites reinforced with continuous fibers. In addition, it identified the applicability of recycled polymers in developing ME processes. Thus, the study includes an experimental program to investigate the mechanical performance of 3D printed samples (polylactic acid, PLA, matrix reinforced with continuous aramid filament) through a tensile test. Recycled polymer replaced 40% of the virgin PLA. The test results do not demonstrate the recycled polymer's negative effect on the mechanical performance of the printed samples. Moreover, the recycled material reduced the PLA cost by almost twice. However, together with the potential efficiency of the developed adaptive manufacturing technology, the mechanical characteristics of the printed material revealed room for printing technology improvement, including the aligned reinforcement distribution in the printed product and printing parameters' setup.

Additive manufactured thermoplastic elastomers for low-stress driven elastocaloric cooling	APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY			English	Article						Elastocaloric cooling; Additive manufacturing; Elastomers; Low-stress; Strain-induced crystallization (SIC)	STRAIN-INDUCED CRYSTALLIZATION; POISSONS RATIO; PERFORMANCE; RUBBER	Exploiting the strain-induced crystallization of soft elastomeric polymers elastocaloric cooling has recently been explored as an environmental-friendly alternative to conventional refrigeration. Elastomers require a much lower applied stress to induce the elastocaloric effect compared to shape memory alloys. Several prototype coolers employing these soft polymers have been demonstrated to achieve a moderate temperature span under lower stresses. Here, we investigate the elastocaloric properties and potential cooling performance of five thermoplastic elastomers that can be 3D printed, both in the form of filaments and as Additive Manufactured (AM) parts. The materials were first characterized as filaments to screen for the elastomers with the highest elastocaloric effects. A large adiabatic temperature change of 17.8 K was obtained in the Ultimaker98A filament. AM parameters were optimized to achieve parts with satisfactory functional stability while maintaining their elastocaloric effect. As a printed part, NinjaFlex achieved a high material coefficient of performance (COPmat) of 3.2 with 1.74 J/g input work at similar to 0.1 Hz, driven by a stress of 5.7 MPa. Implementing AM elastocaloric elastomers creates opportunities for the development of full-scale low-activation-stress regenerative elastocaloric cooling components that enable optimizing flow structures and enhanced heat-transfer performance.

Additive manufacturing has emerged as a valuable option to fabricate structured materials, i.e. cellular or lattice materials. Numerous works related to such materials have used additive manufacturing including extruder-based technologies and laser-based technologies, among others. Each technique results in advantages and disadvantages. Consequently, a review of the different additive-manufacturing technologies used to fabricate cellular and lattice materials is presented here, summarizing the applicability and limitations of each technique. The techniques are categorized according to the state of the raw material they use filament, fluid, and powder. Additionally, guidance on the use of each is given to benefit the fabrication of structured materials.

Different diols and dicarboxylic acids from both petrochemical and renewable resources were combined to create polyester structures that have not been previously described. Employing these monomers allowed for the synthesis of novel polyester resins with a biobased content from 56 to 100%. The influence of the different chemical structures (double bond density, flexibility, aromatic content, etc.) of these itaconic acid-based materials on the physicochemical properties was thoroughly investigated for the first time. Subsequently, formulations derived from these polyesters were prepared and processed on a digital light processing (DLP)-machine to obtain test specimen. Mechanical and thermal characterization of cured parts revealed a dependency of the properties on both choice of monomers and crosslink density. Cyclic structures in the polyester resin resulted in very rigid materials with glass transition temperatures up to 97 degrees C and tensile modulus of 2400 MPa. The incorporation of longer aliphatic chains on the other hand gave rise to flexible materials with an elongation at break up to 50%. Hence, the materials described herein allow for additive manufacturing materials with tunable properties and an overall bio-based content up to 85%.

The paper presents a conceptual design of an extrusion head used in Fused Deposition Technology, which allows for the implementation of appropriately stacked fibers at the level of detail production. Finite element simulation was performed to simulate the thermal effect of the system to demonstrate the effect of head cooling on the system. The assumed extrusion temperature of the material was obtained at a uniform nozzle temperature and stable temperature of the entire system. Flow simulation of thermoplastic polymer was carried out in the designed extrusion nozzle. By supplying 0.5 mm wire of 1.75 mm diameter thermoplastic material to the nozzle, the extrusion rate was 0.192 m/s. The proper design of the extrusion head for the intended applications has been demonstrated and the purpose of further research in this field has been confirmed.

Repetitive deposition of nanometer scale coatings of the ceramic, in this way, is employed to create defect-free infiltrations of carbon fiber composites. The mechanical strength of the fibers is retained in the composite. Excellent wetting properties of the polymer precursor permits three-dimensional, conformal coating through the three stages of infiltration: nanoscale coating of the single fibers, filling of interstitial spaces between the fibers, and a buildup of the coating over the entire composite. The flash pyrolysis method will enable a new genre of polymer-derived ceramics made into net shape by this unusual method of additive manufacturing.

This new technology has been used to manufacture small tidal and wind turbines. In isolated areas, small turbines can be manufactured and assembled on-site for green energy production. The purpose of this document is to evaluate the thermomechanical behavior of a printed tidal turbine using Digimat-AM (Additive Manufacturing) with fused filament fabrication method. The finite element computes the mechanical deflection, temperature, residual stresses, and warpage fields of the printed part. The composites used during printing are thermoplastic polymers (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polyamide 6 [PA6], polyamide 12 [PA12], and polyetherimide [PEI]) reinforced with carbon and glass fillers in the form of fibers and beads (CF/GF and CB/GB). Through the simulation, one could show that the blade printed with PEI-CB/CF has excellent mechanical performance of low mechanical deflection and warpage, compared to PA6-CB/CF. In addition, the fiber-shaped fillers are better than the bead-shaped ones for the 3D printing process. In general, this study has shown the potential and feasibility of 3D printing as an excellent opportunity in the fabrication of small blades in the future, but more studies are required to understand this potential.

Binder jetting additive manufacturing with a particle-free metal ink as a binder precursor	MATERIALS & DESIGN			English	Article						MOD ink; Nanoparticle; Inkjet printing; Binder jetting; Additive manufacturing; Copper	CONDUCTIVE PATTERNS; COPPER; DECOMPOSITION; NANOPARTICLES; TEMPERATURE	Metal-Organic-Decomposition (MOD) ink is a particle-free metal ink that can precipitate metal nanoparticles upon heating. This ink-jettable metal nanoparticle ink can be used as a binder precursor to replace commonly used polymer adhesives in the Additive Manufacturing of metals components using binder jetting technology. After being deposited into the powder bed interstices and exposed to a heat, the jetted ink decomposes and form metal nanoparticles that are then fused by sintering to provide bonding strength to the printed parts. Regions of the powder bed that do not receive the jetted nanoparticles remain as loose powder, as the heat supplied to sinter nanoparticles is maintained below the initial sintering temperature of larger powder bed particles. The proof of concept is demonstrated in the context of printing copper by jetting copper MOD ink as a precursor to the binder, with the capability of producing satisfactory geometries when using sufficiently high binder saturation ratio. After sintering, the MOD ink printed parts produce a denser core section but more porous shell in the sintered parts, compared to the polymer binder printed counterparts.

Currently able to manipulate many polymers (both synthetic and organic), this technique is quickly becoming an integral part of biotechnological developments. This paper highlights the fundamentals of this technology namely the mechanisms employed in standard 3D printing, it then introduces tissue engineering a field in which current versions of this technology have been employed as bioprinting. The limitations with respect to tissue engineering are discussed outlining the current technologies inability to produce nanofibre based structures common in tissue such as tendon, cartilage and cornea. From this requirement for nanofibre production, electrospinning is introduced as a potential pathway for future tissue engineering 3D printing technologies and finally the current combination of this technology with 3D Printing is discussed yielding current limitations in retaining required nanoresolutions.

Upper bound of feed rates in thermoplastic material extrusion additive manufacturing	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Material extrusion; Upper bound; Jamming; Feed rates; Thermal model; Temperature distribution; Fused-filament fabrication	MOLTEN POLYMER FLOW; HEAT-TRANSFER	In this work, we develop a simple model to determine the upper bound of feed rates that do not cause jamming in material extrusion additive manufacturing, also known as fused deposition modeling (FDM)(TM) or fused-filament fabrication (FFF). We first derive a relation between the tube temperature and Peclet number for the solid portion of polymer filaments. We focus on the boundary between the solid and molten polymer in the heated portion of the tube. We find the Peclet number that corresponds to the point at which this boundary makes contact with the nozzle, and identify this as the upper bound of the feed rate. We compare our predictions to experimental results. We find good agreement for tube temperatures sufficiently above the glass-transition temperature, which is the temperature region of typical additive manufacturing.

A study on additive manufacturing build parameters as bonded joint design factors	JOURNAL OF ADHESION			English	Article; Early Access						Adhesive bonding; additive manufacturing; fused filament fabrication; surface roughness; wettability; fracture toughness; surface modification		This work explores the influence of Additive Manufacturing (AM) parameters on the Mode I fracture toughness of polymer bonded joints. The motivation is that realizing AM parts to be later assembled can be convenient from the manufacturing standpoint and adhesive bonding avoids distortion and material modification due to heat while welding or the use of fasteners. PLA and ABS joints were tested and three different printing parameters (extruder temperature, printing speed and layer thickness) were selected to evaluate their influence on roughness, wettability and tensile behaviour of the adherends. A full-factorial Design of Experiment was chosen to study roughness and wettability because of the short sample manufacturing and measurement time, while a Taguchi L9 orthogonal array was selected for the tensile testsr to save manufacturing and testing time. The significance and the mutual interactions of printing parameters were identified by analysis of variance. Combinations yielding maximum and minimum values of the output, respectively, were used to produce adherends for Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) joints and evaluate the effect on Mode I fracture toughness, demonstrating that process parameters do have an effect on fracture toughness and that an optimum value can be found by simply operating on the AM setup.

Design/methodology/approach This study was based on the systematic literature review. Findings The investigation found that most authors were concerned about the energy consumption of the AM equipment, which is the subject studied by 87% of articles. In addition, 25% of the studies used LCA at least in some level, making a global environment assessment to evaluate the environmental impacts of AM. By analyzing research studies, it was possible to find signs that AM could be a lower environmental impact process, when compared with traditional manufacturing. However, this assumption is not valid in all cases because there are many variables that may affect environmental results. Originality/value Due to the increase on the usage of this type of technology by industries, studies on the environmental performance of this process became relevant.

J	Wang, FJ; You, SY; Jiang, DY; Ning, FD				Wang, Fuji; You, Siyao; Jiang, Dayue; Ning, Fuda			Study on sintering mechanism for extrusion-based additive manufacturing of stainless steel through molecular dynamics simulation	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Printing-debinding-sintering process; Stainless steel; Molecular dynamics; Sintering mechanism	GRAIN-GROWTH; SURFACE; POWDER; PARAMETERS; NI; THERMODYNAMICS; DILATOMETRY; ORIENTATION; TEMPERATURE; DIFFUSION	Unlike conventional metal powder based additive manufacturing (AM) technology, a Printing-Debinding-Sintering (PDS) process that adopts polymer-based filaments with highly filled metal particles can be employed as an economical approach to create metal parts at high fabrication rate and a low manufacturing cost. To achieve dense metal parts, the underlying sintering mechanism should be well understood, which has not yet been documented. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was conducted to comprehensively unveil the sintering mechanisms during PDS of stainless steel 316L using a novel Fe-Ni-Cr three-element, three-particle sintering configuration. The mechanism of Cr element aggregation at the grain boundaries was revealed by analyzing the evolution of particle structure, diffusion activation energy, and interactions among solute elements during the unique heating process of PDS. In addition, the microstructure of the PDS-built 316L samples was characterized to verify such an aggregation phenomenon. It was found that the self-diffusion coefficient of Cr element increased substantially at the 1600 K holding stage. Meanwhile, Cr element was diffused to grain boundary and formed severe grain boundary aggregation due to its lower diffusion activation energy and stronger interactions between atoms. Moreover, the extra energy released due to this aggregation phenomenon promoted a further coalescence of particles. This study provides an atomic-scale understanding of sintering behavior of PDS-built Fe-based alloys, which paves a way for the multiscale modeling of the sintering process in PDS of other alloy systems.

Its potential in the field of fabricating drug delivery systems, by virtue of processing biocompatible polymers, has been very lucrative. This work aims to tap the interstitial drug delivery kinetics that are often inaccessible through machine-specific infill patterns in additive manufactured tablets fabricated using PVA biopolymer as an excipient. In this regard, a myo-inositol containing tablet has been printed using Fused Deposition Modeling preceded by Hot Melt Extrusion drug loading route. Two machine-specific infill patterns were taken, namely straight and grid. Later, these two distinct patterns were juxtaposed to obtain novel hybrid infill patterns in the tablets. Then, these tablets and their filament were subjected to various thermal, mechanical, imaging and pharmaceutical characterization tests to assess the feasibility of the research attempt. Finally, dissolution tests were conducted to evaluate their dissolution behavior over a time period. The characterization tests proved the scientific viability of this attempt along with amorphous existence of drug in the polymeric filament. The dissolution results showed favorable drug release by achieving interstitial dissolution timings with surface area/volume (SA/V) ratio being found to be the principal factor.

These are typically made from aluminum or glass, but there are clear disadvantages to both and restrictions on which materials can be processed on them successfully. This study examined the suitability of heated aluminum-polycarbonate (AL-PC) composite print beds for FDM, looking particularly at the mechanical properties, thermal behavior, deformation behavior, bonding strength with deposited material, printing quality, and range of material usability. Theoretical examination and physical experiments were performed for each of these areas; the results were compared to similar experiments done using heated aluminum and aluminum-glass print beds. Ten distinct materials (ABS, PLA, PET, HIPS, PC, TPU, PVA, nylon, metal PLA, and carbon-fiber PLA) were tested for printing performance. The use of a heated AL-PC print bed was found to be a practical option for most of the materials, particularly ABS and TPU, which are often challenging to process using traditional print bed types. Generally, the results were found to be equivalent to or superior to tempered glass and superior to standard aluminum build plates in terms of printing capability.

Prismatic specimens were fabricated via the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technique and Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors were embedded within the structures during the building process. The specimens were manufactured featuring various raster orientations and were then subjected to thermal cycling. The wavelength measurements recorded from the optical sensors were employed for the calculation of the thermally induced strains in the specimens as a function of temperature. The obtained curves presented a linear behavior until the T-g, where the internal phase change is manifested with a peak and a subsequent decline of the curve. The LIE, was calculated and the effect of raster orientation on the thermal expansion behavior was identified. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the light of this, qualitative considerations such as the geometrical accuracy, the resulting mechanical properties, and the surface quality of additively manufactured parts must be taken into account. Optical measuring techniques such as confocal laser scanning microscopy, fringe projection and focus variation as well as profilometers are evaluated here, to determine the surface quality of powder bed-based manufactured parts. Even though these surface evaluation methods are established commercially, no standardized measuring procedure has yet been established. Within an experimental study the validity and accuracy of surface measurement methods are evaluated below, taking the limitations of each measurement system and the comparability of areal surface textures into account. The examinations are carried out with the powder materials EN-AW2024, Ti-6V-4Al and PA12, which are processed by electron beam melting, and laser beam melting of metals and polymers. Guidance for a consistent and comparable surface evaluation is thereby provided.

The aim of this paper is to develop an innovative and efficient methodology to recycle the beer bagasse by producing Poly-lactic acid(PLA)-based bio-composites, in the forms of pellets and filaments, to be used in additive manufacturing processes. To assess the suitability of beer bagasse for extrusion-based 3D printing techniques, it was, firstly, physically and chemically characterized. Then, it was added in combination with different kinds of plasticizers to PLA to make bio-composites, analyzing their thermal and physical properties. The results prove the great potential of bagasse, evidencing its printability. Both composites' pellets and filaments were used in two different 3D printing machines and the mechanical properties of the 3D-printed models were evaluated as a function of the composition and the kind of technology used. All the used plasticizers improved processability and the polymer-bagasse interface. Compared to neat PLA, no changes in thermal properties were detected, but a lowering of the mechanical properties of the 3D-printed composites compared to the neat polymers was observed. Finally, a comparison between the efficiency of the two 3D printing techniques to be used with the bio-based composites was performed.

However, the high viscosity of high-performance polymers causes complications during the FFF process and reduces the final print quality. To overcome this challenge, Inorganic Fullerene Tungsten Sulphide (IF-WS2) nanoparticles are applied in this study to enhance the flowability of poly-ether-ketone-ketone (PEEK) without compromising its mechanical and thermal properties. In the first step, different loadings of IF-WS2 nanoparticles are melt compounded with PEEK and the nanocomposites are characterized. SEM and EDX images of fractured surfaces indicate that a good dispersion of nanoparticles is achieved without any pre-treatment or pre-dispersion. A reduction in melt viscosity of 25%, and a simultaneous growth in storage modulus, crystallization and degradation temperature of about 60%, 53% and 100 degrees C is found with addition of 2 wt% IF-WS2 to PEEK, respectively. This great achievement is mainly ascribed to the unique characteristics of IF-WS2 nanoparticles, acting as both reinforcing and lubricating agents, indicated by a reduction in coefficient of friction. There is no significant increase of crystallization and melting temperatures with the addition of IF-WS2 nanoparticles, which is beneficial in the FFF process. In the second step, the PEEK nanocomposite filaments are printed via FFF. The print quality and mechanical properties of the printed PEEK are also improved with the incorporation of IF-WS2 nanoparticles. Hence, incorporation of IF-WS2 nanoparticles into PEEK via melt compounding is an effective approach for the development of suitable high-performance engineering materials for FFF.

Compared to their oil-based counterparts, they provide several advantages with their low carbon footprints, ease of reusability and recyclability and abundancy, and comparable price ranges. In consideration of their increasing usage, the present study focused on the development and analysis of biocomposite material blends and filaments by merging state-of-the-art manufacturing and material technologies. A thorough suitability study for fused deposition modeling (FDM), which is used to manufacture samples by depositing the melt layer-by-layer, was carried out. The mechanical, thermal, and microstructural characterization of birch fiber reinforced PLA composite granules, in-house extruded filaments, and printed specimens were investigated. The results demonstrated the printability of biocomposite filaments. However, it was also concluded that the parameters still need to be optimized for generic and flawless filament extrusion and printing processes. Thus, minimal labor and end-products with better strength and resolutions can be achieved.

In contrast, polymer nanopatterning by nanolithographic techniques plays an important role in obtaining functional surfaces and coatings for applications in different fields including micro- and nanoelectronics. In spite of their relevance, additive manufacturing and polymer nanolithography have not found yet a common niche to be developed. Although both approaches are oriented to achieve different types of objects, it is shown that the confluence of both technologies can be desirable and potentially convenient. Herein, it is demonstrated that by employing conventional 3D printing, it is possible to fabricate nanostructured polymer surfaces in a relatively simple way by using similar approaches as those used in nanoimprint lithography but without the need for clean room conditions. To do that, a printed-assisted nanoimprint lithography concept (3DPrANIL) has been tested for different types of polymer and silicon templates. It is demonstrated that a polymeric nanostructured hydrophilic template can be replicated accurately on another polymer rendering a nanostructured surface with enhanced hydrophobicity. The results support 3DPrANIL as novel method to obtain micro- and nanostructured surfaces with different functionalities like iridescence and hydrophobicity.

Additive manufacturing of high-performance vinyl ester resin via direct ink writing with UV-thermal dual curing	ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; Direct ink writing; Vinyl ester; Unsaturated resin; UV-thermal dual curing	TERT-BUTYL PEROXYBENZOATE; RUNAWAY REACTION; CURE KINETICS; FABRICATION; STEREOLITHOGRAPHY	Vinyl ester (VE) resin is widely used as a thermosetting polymer for structural materials because of its high mechanical properties and excellent chemical resistance. Using additive manufacturing to produce highperformance VE structures with dimensional scalability and material efficiency has gained interest from both research and industry, however it is challenging due to the limitations of current techniques. In this work, a modified setup of direct ink writing (DIW) with ultraviolet (UV)-thermal dual curing is made compatible with commercially available VE resins thickened by 4 wt% fumed silica to fabricate three-dimensional structures with outstanding mechanical properties. The in-situ UV curing during DIW partially solidifies the resin to provide the structural shape, and subsequent thermal curing allows for a high degree of crosslinking. The printed and dual cured VE nanocomposites have a Young's modulus of 3.7 GPa and a tensile strength of approximately 80 MPa, which outperforms conventionally molded neat VE cured with methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP) by about 10% and also indistinguishable from the tensile properties of molded VE nanocomposites with the same composition. The fracture toughness of the printed and dual cured VE nanocomposites is also 16% higher than the molded neat VE with MEKP curing due to the superior interfacial bonding between DIW infill paths and the additional 4 wt% fumed silica for toughening, and similar to the molded VE nanocomposites with the same composition. Along with the outstanding mechanical properties, the scalability and resolution of the DIW technique with dual curing is demonstrated by printing a 100 mm long wrench and a microscale lattice, thus showing the potential of this technique in additive manufacturing of high-performance VE structures.

The extrusion based Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) method using thermoplastics represents a robust and simple methodology applicable to printing parts for both current and future human spaceflight exploration missions. Understanding the performance and behaviour of the FFF process under varying gravity loads is therefore an important knowledge gap that needs to be addressed in order to fully appreciate the characteristics of space manufactured elements. At present, it is not well understood how gravity can influence the characteristics of such elements fabricated in variable gravity environments. In this study, we detail an experiment conducted on a parabolic flight campaign (PFC) wherein we produced a number of FFF polylactic acid (PLA) polymer test articles and compared them to terrestrially fabricated articles. We report on the methodology and the operational parameters used, as well as presenting an analysis of the samples via optical microscopy and tomography. Compressive, tensile and other technical properties are reported herein. A number of explanations are presented to explain the variance in specimens relative to terrestrial reference samples.

The reason is the possibility of combining sustainability with scientific and technological progress. This is an extremely broad research topic, and a distinction has to be made among different classes and types of biopolymers. Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) is a particular family of polyesters, synthetized by microorganisms under unbalanced growth conditions, making them both bio-based and biodegradable polymers with a thermoplastic behavior. Recently, PHAs were used more intensively in biomedical applications because of their tunable mechanical properties, cytocompatibility, adhesion for cells, and controllable biodegradability. Similarly, the 3D-printing technologies show increasing potential in this particular field of application, due to their advantages in tailor-made design, rapid prototyping, and manufacturing of complex structures. In this review, first, the synthesis and the production of PHAs are described, and different production techniques of medical implants are compared. Then, an overview is given on the most recent and relevant medical applications of PHA for drug delivery, vessel stenting, and tissue engineering.

However, the presence of ceramic filler destroys the fluidity and transparency of high-k PMCs, reducing their 3D printability. In this study, we fabricated barium titanate microspheres (BT-S) to facilitate the SL-based 3D printing of high-k PMCs using radio-frequency thermal plasma spheroidization (RF-TPS) technology. Experimental results showed that the prepared BT-S particles have spherical shape, smooth surface, large particle size, improved mechanical strength and higher purity, which lead to the enhancement in the 3D printability of UV curable high-k composites: i) the employment of BT-S significantly reduces the apparent viscosity and yield stress; and ii) the UV curing depth increased by 542% maximum. As a result, high-k composites were successfully printed using digital light processing (DLP) technique under low UV light energy. Moreover, the increase of dielectric constant was experimentally verified, which is explained by electrostatic energy increment according to finite element method (FEM) simulations. This study provided an effective approach (i.e. RF-TPS technology) to enhance the 3D printability of high-k PMCs, and also promoted the usage of SL-based 3D printing in advanced electrical and electronic components (C) 2020 The Authors.

In this study, we assessed the processability of medical grade Poly(lactic-co-glycolic) Acid (PLGA)85:15 via two additive manufacturing technologies: Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) and Direct Pellet Printing (DPP) to highlight the least destructive technology towards PLGA. To quantify PLGA degradation, its molecular weight (gel permeation chromatography (GPC)) as well as its thermal properties (differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)) were evaluated at each processing step, including sterilization with conventional methods (ethylene oxide, gamma, and beta irradiation). Results show that 3D printing of PLGA on a DPP printer significantly decreased the number-average molecular weight (M-n) to the greatest extent (26% M-n loss, p < 0.0001) as it applies a longer residence time and higher shear stress compared to classic FFF (19% M-n loss, p < 0.0001). Among all sterilization methods tested, ethylene oxide seems to be the most appropriate, as it leads to no significant changes in PLGA properties. After sterilization, all samples were considered to be non-toxic, as cell viability was above 70% compared to the control, indicating that this manufacturing route could be used for the development of bioabsorbable medical devices. Based on our observations, we recommend using FFF printing and ethylene oxide sterilization to produce PLGA medical devices.

Fused deposition modeling (FDM) process is one of the most popular and conventional additive manufacturing methods to produce three-dimensional (3D) specimens from computer-aided design data with complex geometry and lower prices in comparison with the alternative methods. Given the advantages of this process, it seems inevitable for the development of new materials. Utilizing semicrystalline plastics impose challenges for producing parts due to printing issues such as distortion and warpage. In this experimental work, a compounding production line was implemented to produce composite filaments with 25, 50, and 75 wt % of copper powder suitable for the FDM process. After dealing with printing issues, flexural, electrical conductivity, and bulk density tests were done. The micrographs of the specimens were examined via scanning electron microscopy to reveal the distribution of the copper particles. It is believed that the metal/polymer filament could be used to print new 3D parts. The material could be utilized in electromagnetic structures for some specific applications, such as shielding, with new properties. Also, by solving printing problems for a semicrystalline polymer, it can be encouraging to examine printing process for other rarely used thermoplastics. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl.

J	Gaurkhede, SG; Han, YW; Deng, J				Gaurkhede, Shantanu G.; Han, Yiwei; Deng, Jia			Electric Field-Assisted Fused Filament Fabrication Process for Robust Additive Manufacturing in Unconventional Orientations	MANUFACTURING LETTERS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	51st SME North American Manufacturing Research Conference (NAMRC)	JUN 12-16, 2023	Rutgers Univ, New Brunswick, NJ	SME	Rutgers Univ	Additive manufacturing; 3D printing; fused filament fabrication; electric field; in-space 3D printing	TECHNOLOGY; DESIGN	Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is one of the most widely used thermoplastic additive manufacturing techniques that have great potential for numerous applications. However, for more advanced additive manufacturing with unusual environments, such as in-space manufacturing, conventional FFF is limited by the lack of gravity and inconsistent nozzle standoff distance. Varying nozzle standoff distances in the FFF process typically result in problems with the adhesion of extruded material as well as dimensional and geometrical errors in the extruded material, which leads to a long setup time and a high failure rate. Conventional FFF typically needs continuous monitoring or human intervention to ensure successful printing. This paper innovated an electric field-assisted FFF (E-FFF) process for robust fabricating parts in unconventional printing orientations while eliminating the need for constant supervision and human intervention to maintain and adjust the z-height calibration. The E-FFF system integrates a high-voltage power supply with a conventional FFF printer to produce an electrostatic force between the nozzle and the build plate. The generated electrostatic force is capable of attracting the extruded molten polymer material towards the build plate even at larger z-heights of up to 1200 mu m under unconventional printing orientations. The effectiveness of the E-FFF process was demonstrated by comparing the E-FFF and conventional FFF processes. The results affirm the assistance of gravitational force on conventional FFF processes in the normal printing orientation. The novel E-FFF process with robust printing capabilities in the vertical and reverse orientations enables much larger nozzle standoff distances than that of the conventional FFF process, which exhibits great potential to be used in the micro/zero-gravity environment in the future. A two-dimensional finite element simulation model is used to understand the effects of applied voltage on the E-FFF process and calculate the electric field intensity. The simulation results showed that the electric field intensity of E = 1.27x106 V/m is sufficient for successful printing in all demonstrated printing orientations. (c) 2023 The Authors.

In practice, however, much effort is focused on the AM of polymers. It is comparatively more expensive and more challenging to additively manufacture metallic parts due to their high temperature, the cost of producing powders, and capital outlays for metal additive manufacturing equipment. The main technology currently used by numerous companies in the aerospace and biomedical sectors to fabricate metallic parts is powder bed technology, in which either electron or laser beams are used to melt and fuse the powder particles line by line to make a three-dimensional part. Since this technology is new and also sought by manufacturers, many scientific questions have arisen that need to be answered. This manuscript gives an introduction to the technology and common materials and applications. Furthermore, the microstructure and quality of parts made using powder bed technology for several materials that are commonly fabricated using this technology are reviewed and the effects of several process parameters investigated in the literature are examined. New advances in fabricating highly conductive metals such as copper and aluminum are discussed and potential for future improvements is explored.

Investigation of printable threshold overhang angle in extrusion-based additive manufacturing for reducing support waste	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Additive manufacturing; support structure; printable threshold overhang angle; surface quality	STRUCTURE GENERATION; OPTIMIZATION; TECHNOLOGIES; SELECTION; POLYMERS; DESIGN; PARTS	Notwithstanding the widespread use and large number of advantages over traditional subtractive manufacturing techniques, the application of additive manufacturing technologies is currently limited by undesirable support material waste. Support structures are unavoidable when manufacturing objects with overhangs in extrusion-based Additive manufacturing, leading to extra build time and material waste. In a manufacturing process, different parameters such as cooling fan speed, print speed and print temperature can make a great contribution to printable overhang angle size. In this study, effects of these parameters on printable overhang angle size are studied theoretically and experimentally. First, theoretical analysis of printable overhang is conducted. Then experiments of overhangs with 20 degrees, 30 degrees, 40 degrees and 50 degrees are carried out with regard to different parameters on an FDM printer. According to the results, the printable threshold overhang angle varies substantially with printing conditions. The findings of this paper can then be applied for setting a lower threshold overhang angle for reducing support waste in the future. The findings can also provide some reference for future research in high-precision printing by adjusting relevant print parameters.

Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) is one of these guides adapted to Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies used to increase the operational performance of components, mini-mise material waste and provide design flexibility. DfAM optimises three-dimensional (3D) printing parameters to maximise the potential of AM technologies. DfAM improves ecological performance and provides many ad-vantages for the transition to a circular economy by providing resource efficiency and enabling the production of parts with reduced weight without changing their mechanical strength. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the infill density, infill pattern and layer thickness on the printing time, weight, Young's modulus, compressive stress, surface roughness, tensile strength, CO2 emissions and amount of material used for the samples printed using Poly-lactic acid (PLA) in the Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) method. PLA has been chosen because it is a natural and recyclable polymer derived entirely from plant sources. In the printing process, samples with different mechanical properties have been obtained by changing the infill density (25%, 50% and 75%), the infill pattern (gyroid, triangle and grid) and the layer thickness (100, 150 and 200 mu m) parameters. The Design of Experiment (DoE) method is provided to find optimal combinations of the selected parameters. Ac-cording to the results of the study, the effect of the layer thickness differs on each output. While the infill density is 75%, grid and triangle structures generally give the best results among the infill patterns; infill density of 25% varies according to the infill pattern. The gyroid and triangle patterns give optimum results for less layer thickness (e.g. 100 mu m), while the grid should be preferred for higher layer thickness (e.g. 200 mu m).

J	Papon, EA; Haque, A; Sharif, MAR				Papon, Easir Arafat; Haque, Anwarul; Sharif, Muhammad Ali Rob			Numerical study for the improvement of bead spreading architecture with modified nozzle geometries in additive manufacturing of polymers	RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL			English	Article						Numerical simulation; Additive manufacturing; Fused filament fabrication; Volume of fluid; Multi phase flow	FUSED-FILAMENT-FABRICATION; DEPOSITION MODELING PROCESS; PROCESS PARAMETERS; CRYSTALLIZATION; OPTIMIZATION; COMPOSITES; DEFORMATION; DESIGN; SYSTEM; VOLUME	Purpose This paper aims to develop a numerical model of bead spreading architecture of a viscous polymer in fused filament fabrication (FFF) process with different nozzle geometry. This paper also focuses on the manufacturing feasibility of the nozzles and 3D printing of the molten beads using the developed nozzles. Design/methodology/approach The flow of a highly viscous polymer from a nozzle, the melt expansion in free space and the deposition of the melt on a moving platform are captured using the FLUENT volume of fluid (VOF) method based computational fluid dynamics code. The free surface motion of the material is captured in VOF, which is governed by the hydrodynamics of the two-phase flow. The phases involved in the numerical model are liquid polymer and air. A laminar, non-Newtonian and non-isothermal flow is assumed. Under such assumptions, the spreading characteristic of the polymer is simulated with different nozzle-exit geometries. The governing equations are solved on a regular stationary grid following a transient algorithm, where the boundary between the polymer and the air is tracked by piecewise linear interface construction (PLIC) to reconstruct the free surface. The prototype nozzles were also manufactured, and the deposition of the molten beads on a flatbed was performed using a commercial 3D printer. The deposited bead cross-sections were examined through optical microscopic examination, and the cross-sectional profiles were compared with those obtained in the numerical simulations. Findings The numerical model successfully predicted the spreading characteristics and the cross-sectional shape of the extruded bead. The cross-sectional shape of the bead varied from elliptical (with circular nozzle) to trapezoidal (with square and star nozzles) where the top and bottom surfaces are significantly flattened (which is desirable to reduce the void spaces in the cross-section). The numerical model yielded a good approximation of the bead cross-section, capturing most of the geometric features of the bead with a reasonable qualitative agreement compared to the experiment. The quantitative comparison of the cross-sectional profiles against experimental observation also indicated a favorable agreement. The significant improvement observed in the bead cross-section with the square and star nozzles is the flattening of the surfaces. Originality/value The developed numerical algorithm attempts to address the fundamental challenge of voids and bonding in the FFF process. It presents a new approach to increase the inter-bead bonding and reduce the inter-bead voids in 3D printing of polymers by modifying the bead cross-sectional shape through the modification of nozzle exit-geometry. The change in bead cross-sectional shape from elliptical (circular) to trapezoidal (square and star) cross-section is supposed to increase the contact surface area and inter-bead bonding while in contact with adjacent beads.

Melt-Extrusion-Based Additive Manufacturing of Transparent Fused Silica Glass	ADVANCED SCIENCE			English	Article						3D printing; additive manufacturing; fused deposition modeling; fused feedstock deposition; fused silica glass; multimaterial printing; nanocomposites	FUTURE; STATE	In recent years, additive manufacturing (AM) of glass has attracted great interest in academia and industry, yet it is still mostly limited to liquid nanocomposite-based approaches for stereolithography, two-photon polymerization, or direct ink writing. Melt-extrusion-based processes, such as fused deposition modeling (FDM), which will allow facile manufacturing of large thin-walled components or simple multimaterial printing processes, are so far inaccessible for AM of transparent fused silica glass. Here, melt-extrusion-based AM of transparent fused silica is introduced by FDM and fused feedstock deposition (FFD) using thermoplastic silica nanocomposites that are converted to transparent glass using debinding and sintering. This will enable printing of previously inaccessible glass structures like high-aspect-ratio (>480) vessels with wall thicknesses down to 250 mu m, delicate parts including overhanging features using polymer support structures, as well as dual extrusion for multicolored glasses.

Within this context, 3D printing is a remarkable technology for developing electrochemical devices, due to no design constraints, waste minimization, and batch manufacturing with high reproducibility. However, the fabrication of 3D printed electrodes is still limited by the in-house fabrication of conductive filaments, which requires the mixture of the electroactive material with melted of thermoplastic polymer (e.g., polylactic acid, PLA). Herein, a simple approach is presented for preparing electrochemical dopamine (DA) biosensors. Specifically, the surface of 3D-printed PLA specimens, which exhibit an elastic modulus and a tensile strength of 3.7 +/- 0.3 GPa and 47 +/- 1 MPa, respectively, is activated applying a 0.5 m NaOH solution for 30 min and, subsequently, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) is polymerized in situ using aqueous solvent. The detection of DA with the produced sensors has been demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, and chronoamperometry. In summary, the obtained results reflect that low-cost electrochemical sensors, which are widely used in medicine and biotechnology, can be rapidly fabricated using the proposed approach that, although based on additive manufacturing, does not require the preparation of conductive filaments.
