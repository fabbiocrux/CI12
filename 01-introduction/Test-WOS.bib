Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (or 3D printing) involves the process of
   fabricating a part by layer-by-layer assembly of materials with
   processes such as extrusion, binding, melting, and photopolymerization.
   It is transforming how we assemble our prototypes and, in the future,
   manufacture our products. There have been a number of materials that can
   be utilized for this technology, however, high performance polymer
   nanocomposites are a very important class of material that is just
   recently being used in additive manufacturing. High performance polymer
   is a group of polymer materials that are known to retain its desirable
   mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties when subjected to harsh
   environment such as high temperature, high pressure, and corrosive
   chemicals. When mixed with nanofillers such as carbon nanotube,
   nanoclay, and graphene, these polymers can have improved mechanical
   properties and sometimes acquire properties that were not present
   initially like thermal and electrical conductivity. This review article
   aims to summarize available additive manufacturing techniques, high
   performance polymers and nanofillers available, and research efforts on
   its use for additive manufacturing. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Mechanics Modeling of Additive Manufactured Polymers},
Booktitle = {POLYMER-BASED ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING: BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Pages = {51-71},
Abstract = {Polymers will continue to dominate the global market of additive
   manufacturing for at least a few decades. Investigating the mechanics of
   additive manufactured polymers not only creates fundamental knowledge of
   their mechanical behaviors but also guides the design and additive
   manufacturing of engineering or biomedical components. Unfortunately,
   the mechanical responses of these polymers are strongly dependent on the
   manufacturing process, material composition, printing orientation,
   temperature, etc., which bring about great challenges for the modeling.
   To overcome such challenges, this chapter introduces two high-fidelity
   nonlinear constitutive models devised specifically for additive
   manufactured photopolymers to facilitate the computational design
   process. The first model is developed to take into account the intrinsic
   anisotropy of photopolymers caused by the layer-wise manufacturing
   feature, while the second model is targeting the thermomechanical
   property of photopolymers across the glass transition temperature, which
   can be used to simulate the shape memory effect. Note that both models
   are applicable to the finite deformation scenario and inelastic
   deformation. At the end of this chapter, we also provide our humble
   opinions on the research demands and trends regarding the mechanics and
   modeling of additive manufactured polymers.},

Abstract = {High-performance engineering polymers continually challenge existing
   boundaries of rapidly emerging research areas including electronics,
   transportation, energy, defense and aerospace. Significant research
   attention over the past decade highlights the exceptional performance of
   these polymers due to their superior thermomechanical properties and
   stability under extreme conditions. Unfortunately, inherent
   structure-property relationships of high-performance engineering
   polymers, which predict this unique complement of physical properties,
   also describe high-viscosity melts and high melting temperatures. These
   processing challenges have steered researchers towards advanced
   processing methods, such as additive manufacturing, that allow for
   unprecedented control over part geometry. In addition, additive
   manufacturing serves to advance application-cost relationships, as part
   optimization and 3D printing of previous monolithic components allow for
   less material consumption. Currently, the additive manufacturing
   materials toolbox only contains a fraction of commercially available
   high-performance polymers due to unique processing constraints. This
   review discusses recent efforts towards the successful additive
   manufacturing of three high-performance polymer families, i.e.
   polysulfones, poly(ether ether ketone)s and polyimides. (c) 2021 Society

   feed materials for additive manufacturing. In the process the polymer is
   molten in a continuous phase and droplet breakup is realized in a
   rotor-stator-device. The stabilization of the newly formed surfaces is
   quite challenging. Therefore, a new method to identify an appropriate
   emulsifier by measuring the interfacial tension between the polymer and
   continuous phase using a high pressure / high temperature cell is
   presented. The obtained powders are characterized by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) and by a Zimmermann tensile strength tester to
   determine the powder flowability. The processability of the polymer
   powders for additive manufacturing is investigated and demonstrated by
   building single layers by laser beam melting.},

Journal = {COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {Fused deposition modeling (FDM) or fused filament fabrication (FFF),
   which is based on polymer melting and extrusion, offers a unique
   manufacturing method to fabricate objects with complex geometries due to
   easy process for polymer deformation through melting and solidification
   and layer-by-layer additive manufacturing. Because of these advantages,
   FDM has attracted considerable attention over the past decades in a
   variety of fields including electronics, biomechanical engineering, and
   sustainable materials. As the demand for functional materials increases,
   polymer composites with diverse reinforcements such as carbon
   nanomaterials, metals, biomaterials, and ceramics have been tailored as
   feedstocks for FDM. Fabrication and printing with polymeric composite
   filaments require understandings of the physical and chemical properties
   as well as thermal-rheology behavior of polymer systems, which are
   crucial to advancing AM development. Herein, we first provide the
   working mechanism of FDM, the criteria for selecting polymers, and
   methods for manufacturing polymer and polymer composite filaments. After
   that, the physical and mechanical properties and printing conditions of
   the pure polymer filaments, multi-material/structure filaments, and
   various applications using polymer composite filaments are discussed and
   summarized. Finally, we share some of our perspectives for the future
   advance of polymer-based filament for FDM.},

Abstract = {Additive Manufacturing, referred to as 3D printing has extended beyond
   simple prototyping and is being used for the fabrication of fully
   functional active components. It is one of the flexible manufacturing
   technique that can apply to polymers, metals, ceramics, concrete, and
   composites. Owing to the ability to select from a wide range of
   processible polymers and the enhancement in some of the properties
   offered by polymers, the AM industry, still predominantly targets the
   production of polymeric components. This review demonstrates the current
   state of AM industry regarding polymeric materials. A brief explanation
   of the additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, polymers, and polymer
   composites (fibre reinforces, particle reinforced and nanocomposites)
   utilised in the AM processes is provided. Polymer AM is being applied in
   different applications such as biomedical, electronics, aerospace,
   automobile, and sporting industries respectively. The review also
   emphasizes the rising importance of antimicrobial polymers in the
   COVID-19 pandemic. The exponential use of polymeric materials in the
   industrial sector has caused an increase in wastage generation and
   disposal issues which draws attention to the importance of green
   composites as well as life cycle assessment (LCA) of products and
   processes. Finally, the significance of Distributed Recycling via AM due
   to the disposal issues and low polymer recycling rates is illustrated.

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), more commonly referred to as 3D printing,
   is revolutionizing the manufacturing industry. With any new technology
   comes new rules and guidelines for the optimal use of said technology.
   Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAAM), developed by Cincinnati
   Incorporated and Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Manufacturing
   Demonstration Facility, requires a host of new design parameters
   compared to small-scale 3D printing to create large-scale parts.
   However, BAAM also creates new possibilities in material testing and
   various applications in the manufacturing industry. Most of the design
   constraints of small-scale polymer 3D printers still apply to BAAM.
   Beyond those constraints, new rules and limitations exist because BAAM's
   large-scale system significantly changes the thermal properties
   associated with small-scale AM. This work details both physical and
   software-related design considerations for additive manufacturing. After
   reading this guide, one will have a better understanding of slicing
   software's capabilities and limitations, different physical
   characteristics of design and how to apply them appropriately for AM,
   and how to take the inherent nature of AM into consideration during the
   design process.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing, or three-dimensional (3D) printing, offers a
   unique solution for fabricating complex geometries with high tolerances.
   Currently, many commercial additive manufacturing machines focus on the
   printing of polymers with limited functionalities. However, conductive
   polymers (CPs) can be processed to enable the additive manufacturing of
   conductive, low-density, and low-cost parts for a myriad of
   applications. This review summarizes the relevant achievements in the
   additive manufacturing of conductive polymers (CPs) and conductive
   polymer nanocomposites, with a discussion of the advantages and
   limitations of processing and printing these materials compared with
   alternative traditional manufacturing methods and their properties.
   Finally, the prospective applications of these additive manufacturing
   printed conductive materials are explored.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The tremendous interest received by additive manufacturing (AM) within
   the biomedical community is a consequence of the great versatility
   offered in terms of processing approach, materials selection, and
   customization of the resulting device. In particular the unparalleled
   control over structural and compositional features at the macroand
   microscale, as a result of the large design freedom and high
   reproducibility, is making AM the technology of election for the
   fabrication of biodegradable medical devices. This article is aimed at
   providing an update overview of scientific literature on biodegradable
   polymers for AM application in the biomedical field. The main AM
   techniques applied so far to biodegradable polymers are outlined by
   presenting relevant materials processing requirements. The different
   classes of biodegradable polymers investigated for AM (i.e., proteins,
   polysaccharides, aliphatic polyesters of either natural or synthetic
   origin, polyurethanes, as well as other synthetic polymers under AM
   implementation) are described by highlighting their source of
   extraction, chemical modification, or synthesis route, and their
   physical chemical and processing properties in relationship to AM.
   Relevant literature on their AM processing for medical and
   pharmaceutical applications is accordingly reviewed. (c) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {As an emerging manufacturing technology, additive manufacturing
   technology, also known as 3D printing technology, has received extensive
   attention in recent years. Additive manufacturing technology has great
   potential in the industry of high-performance ceramics. It is expected
   to break the technical bottle neck of the traditional manufacturing
   technologies used for ceramic fabrication and greatly improve the
   flexibility of design and manufacturing of high-performance ceramics.
   This will provide a transformative impetus for the development of the
   manufacturing technology of the high-performance ceramic materials.
   Polymer-derived ceramics (PDCs) are a class of polymers obtained by
   chemical methods and can be transformed into ceramics by heat
   treatments, i.e., pyrolysis. Due to the good machinability and
   formability of the PDC materials themselves, the pre-forming of the
   designed target structures can be easily realized. These structures
   might not be possible with traditional ceramic manufacturing. Therefore,
   the combination of PDCs and additive manufacturing technology has
   attracted great attention from researchers. This review introduces
   characteristics of the additive manufacturing technology used for
   preceramics. Based on that, the present research status, trends and
   applications are also systematically described and discussed. The
   challenges and future directions of the additive manufacturing of
   polymer-derived ceramics are given for the guidance of future
   development.},

Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The spreading of molten polymer between the moving printing head and the
   substrate in extrusion additive manufacturing is studied. Finite element
   computation and an analytical model have been used. The hypotheses of
   the analytical model are qualitatively justified by the results of the
   numerical computation. The analytical calculation is a powerful tool to
   rapidly evaluate the relationships between processing parameters
   (extrusion rate, printing head velocity, gap between the printing head
   and the substrate) and some characteristics of the deposition
   (dimensions of the deposited filament, pressure at the printing head
   nozzle, separating force between substrate and printing head). An
   isothermal hypothesis is discussed. The viscous non-Newtonian behavior
   is accounted for through an approximate shear thinning power law model.
   A printing processing window is defined following several requirements:
   a continuous deposit, without spreading in front of the printing head,
   maximum and minimum spreading pressures, an upper-limit for the
   separating force between head and substrate.},

Title = {Mechanical anisotropy in polymer composites produced by material
   extrusion additive manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Extrusion-based additive manufacturing technologies, such as direct ink
   writing of filled polymer resins, have shown a great potential for the
   development of printed components with superior structural and
   functional properties. However, the associated extrusion process induces
   preferred orientation on high-aspect-ratio filler materials as they
   extrude through the deposition nozzle, causing strong mechanical
   anisotropy in printed components. Printing-induced anisotropy is a
   critical issue that complicates the straightforward design of additively
   manufactured components. The goal of this work is to gain a better
   understanding of the anisotropy in printed polymer composites by
   investigating the effects of filler morphology and print parameters on
   the mechanical properties of printed composites. Inks are formulated
   using fumed silica particles or nanoclay platelets as the primary
   viscosifying agent, and silicon carbide (SiC) whiskers as the primary
   mechanical reinforcement. Mechanical anisotropy is characterized via
   3pt-flexural tests for epoxy ink formulations utilizing fumed silica or
   nanoclay, with or without SiC whiskers, and printed at three different
   print speeds, using three different nozzle sizes. Orientation of
   nanoclay is also characterized using small- and wide-angle x-ray
   scattering. Results show that smaller nozzle diameters and higher
   deposition rates lead to greater anisotropy when nanoclay or SiC fillers
   are utilized, while the use of fumed silica alone results in mechanical
   behavior that is independent of print parameters and print path.
   Superior flexure strength values up to 215 MPa are obtained with SiC
   whisker-reinforced composites when tested parallel to the print
   direction.},

Abstract = {The exponential increase in the potential applications of graphene has
   forced its inclusion in composites. Presently, composites containing
   graphene have been manufactured by many conventional processes. Since 3D
   printing (additive manufacturing) offers a wide range of advantages for
   manufacturing, researchers from the composite industry are now adopting
   novel techniques to manufacture graphene based composites via additive
   manufacturing. When selecting materials for composites, polymers stand
   out as the top choice for manufacturers because polymers require a low
   temperature to mold their shape and they are easy to handle when
   compared to ceramics and metals. Hence, substantial focus of the
   composite industry is now shifting towards manufacturing graphene based
   polymer matrix composites. In this regard, this paper provides a brief
   review of the 3D printing (additive manufacturing) processes which to
   date have been adopted to manufacture `graphene based polymer matrix
   composites'. The promising physical properties of graphene based polymer
   matrix composites and the future prospects of functionalizing graphene
   in polymer based composites is also highlighted.},

   hybrid metal polymer composite structures},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING LETTERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Metal polymer composites combining low density, high strength composites
   with highly ductile and tough met-als have gained traction over the last
   few decades as lightweight and high-performance materials for industrial
   applications. However, the mechanical properties are limited by the
   interfacial bonding strength between met-als and polymers achieved
   through adhesives, welding, and surface treatment processes. In this
   paper, a novel manufacturing process combining additive manufacturing
   and compression molding to obtain hybrid metal poly-mer composites with
   enhanced mechanical properties is presented. Additive manufacturing
   enabled deposition of polymeric material with fibers in a predetermined
   pattern to form tailored charge or preform for compression molding. A
   grade 300 maraging steel triangular lattice is first fabricated using
   AddUp FormUp350 laser powder bed system and compression overmolded with
   additively manufactured long carbon fiber-reinforced polyamide-6,6 (40\%
   wt. CF/PA66) preform. The fabricated hybrid metal polymer composites
   showed high stiffness and tensile strength. The stiffness and failure
   characteristics determined from the uniaxial tensile tests were
   corre-lated to a finite element model within 20\% deviation.
   Fractographic analyses was performed using microscopy to investigate
   failure mechanisms of the hybrid structures.},

Title = {Scientometric Analysis and Systematic Review of Multi-Material Additive
   Manufacturing of Polymers},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Multi-material additive manufacturing of polymers has experienced a
   remarkable increase in interest over the last 20 years. This technology
   can rapidly design and directly fabricate three-dimensional (3D) parts
   with multiple materials without complicating manufacturing processes.
   This research aims to obtain a comprehensive and in-depth understanding
   of the current state of research and reveal challenges and opportunities
   for future research in the area. To achieve the goal, this study
   conducts a scientometric analysis and a systematic review of the global
   research published from 2000 to 2021 on multi-material additive
   manufacturing of polymers. In the scientometric analysis, a total of
   2512 journal papers from the Scopus database were analyzed by evaluating
   the number of publications, literature coupling, keyword co-occurrence,
   authorship, and countries/regions activities. By doing so, the main
   research frame, articles, and topics of this research field were
   quantitatively determined. Subsequently, an in-depth systematic review
   is proposed to provide insight into recent advances in multi-material
   additive manufacturing of polymers in the aspect of technologies and
   applications, respectively. From the scientometric analysis, a heavy
   bias was found towards studying materials in this field but also a lack
   of focus on developing technologies. The future trend is proposed by the
   systematic review and is discussed in the directions of interfacial
   bonding strength, printing efficiency, and microscale/nanoscale
   multi-material 3D printing. This study contributes by providing
   knowledge for practitioners and researchers to understand the state of
   the art of multi-material additive manufacturing of polymers and expose
   its research needs, which can serve both academia and industry.},

Journal = {COMPOSITE STRUCTURES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {182},
Pages = {36-53},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) of polymer-fiber composites has transformed
   AM into a robust manufacturing paradigm and enabled producing highly
   customized parts with significantly improved mechanical properties,
   compared to un-reinforced polymers. Almost all commercially available AM
   methods could benefit from various fiber reinforcement techniques.
   Recent developments in 3D printing methods of fiber reinforced polymers,
   namely, fused deposition modeling (FDM), laminated object manufacturing
   (LOM), stereolithography (SL), extrusion, and selective laser sintering
   (SLS) are reviewed in this study to understand the trends and future
   directions in the respective areas. In addition to extra strength,
   fibers have also been used in 4D printing to control and manipulate the
   change of shape or swelling after 3D printing, right out of the printing
   bed. Although AM of fiber/polymer composites are increasingly developing
   and under intense attention, there are some issues needed to be
   addressed including void formation, poor adhesion of fibers and matrix,
   blockage due to filler inclusion, increased curing time, modelling,
   simulation, etc. Nonetheless, numerous innovative techniques were
   spotted amongst recent work trying to overcome these challenges with new
   material or manufacturing techniques. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Comparing geometric tolerance capabilities of additive manufacturing
   systems for polymers},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In all manufacturing processes, there are several factors for which the
   final product exhibits dimensional and shape deviations from its ideal
   nominal geometry. In additive manufacturing (AM) and 3D printing, a part
   is built layerwise in a single manufacturing step and is often
   net-shaped. In most cases, no finishing operation is applied to change
   the dimensions of the product, apart from a reduction of the superficial
   roughness through sandblasting or polishing. Therefore, knowing the
   dimensional tolerance of AM processes in advance is of fundamental
   importance, but little information is currently available in the
   literature. A benchmarking analysis of three different AM systems for
   polymers is presented in this paper. The compared machines are based on
   different AM techniques which are fused filament fabrication (FFF),
   selective laser sintering (SLS) and Arburg plastic freeforming (APF).
   The dimensional accuracy of the machines has been defined using the ISO
   IT grades of a reference artifact. In the analysis of the benchmarking
   results, a specific focus is made on the importance of the thermal
   household in SLS and a parameter named SLS modulus is proposed to
   identify critical heat concentrations in the powder bed that may
   influence the dimensional accuracy of the manufactured part.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is the process of printing 3D objects in a
   layer-by-layer manner. Polymers and their composites are some of the
   most widely used materials in modern industries and are of great
   interest in the field of AM due to their vast potential for various
   applications, especially in the medical, aerospace, and automotive
   industries. Many studies have been conducted to develop new polymer
   materials for AM techniques, which include vat photopolymerization,
   material jetting, powder bed fusion, material extrusion, binder jetting,
   and sheet lamination. Although several reviews on the development of
   polymer materials for AM have been published, most of them only focus on
   a specific application, process, or type of material. Therefore, this
   article serves to provide a comprehensive review on the progress in
   polymer material development for AM techniques. It begins with an
   introduction to different AM techniques, followed by highlighting the
   progress of their development. Material requirements, notable advances
   in newly developed materials and their potential applications are
   discussed in detail and summarized. This review concludes by identifying
   the major challenges currently encountered in using AM for polymer
   materials and providing insights into the valuable opportunities it
   presents, in hopes of spurring further development in this field.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) of carbon fibre reinforced thermoplastic
   composites can offer advantages over traditional carbon fibre
   manufacturing through improved design freedom and reduction in
   production time and cost. However, the carbon fibre composites produced
   using current state-of-the-art AM approaches generally possess high
   porosity (18-25 \%) compared to those produced by conventional
   manufacturing (1 \%). An approach known as composite fibre additive
   manufacturing (CFAM) is presented, involving selectively printing a
   binder and polymer powder onto discontinuous carbon fibre sheets, which
   are then compressed, heated and post -processed to form net shape
   components. The results demonstrate a correlation between compaction
   pressure applied and porosity/fibre volume fraction within components.
   Composite components were produced con-taining porosity of 1.5 \% and
   fibre volume content of 15 \% with 97 MPa tensile strength and 8.9 GPa
   elastic modulus, presenting a new approach for production of
   discontinuous carbon fibre reinforced polymer parts with mechanical
   properties exceeding those of state-of-the-art AM.},

Abstract = {The robotics design process can be complex with potentially multiple
   design iterations. The use of 3D printing is ideal for rapid prototyping
   and has conventionally been utilised in concept development and for
   exploring different design parameters that are ultimately used to meet
   an intended application or routine. During the initial stage of a robot
   development, exploiting 3D printing can provide design freedom,
   customisation and sustainability and ultimately lead to direct cost
   benefits. Traditionally, robot specifications are selected on the basis
   of being able to deliver a specific task. However, a robot that can be
   specified by design parameters linked to a distinctive task can be
   developed quickly, inexpensively, and with little overall risk utilising
   a 3D printing process. Numerous factors are inevitably important for the
   design of industrial robots using polymer-based additive manufacturing.
   However, with an extensive range of new polymer-based additive
   manufacturing techniques and materials, these could provide significant
   benefits for future robotics design and development.},

Abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) is close to become a production technique
   changing the way of part fabrication in future. Enhanced complexity and
   personalized features are aimed. The expectations in AM for the future
   are enormous and betimes it is considered as kind of the next industrial
   revolution. Laser Sintering (LS) of polymer powders is one component of
   the AM production techniques. However materials successfully applicable
   to Laser Sintering (LS) are very limited today. The presentation picks
   up this topic and gives a short introduction on the material available
   today. Important factors of polymer powders, their significance for
   effective LS processing and analytical approaches to access those values
   are presented in the main part. Concurrently the exceptional position of
   polyamide 12 powders is this connection is outlined. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing potentially generates customized polymeric
   objects with tailored geometry while reducing waste, employing
   biodegradable polymers and striving to use recyclable polymer feedstocks
   for a more sustainable future. Binder jetting additive manufacturing (BJ
   AM) creates 3D objects upon depositing liquid adhesive onto a powder
   bed, while a roller spreads powder over a build stage to form subsequent
   layers. Many factors affect jettability and printability including
   printhead design, binder material, binder solvent and powder
   characteristics. Material design for higher strength BJ AM parts using
   metals, ceramics or polymers exploits binders or particles that
   transform into thermosets or permanently shaped matrices through thermal
   or UV curing and sintering. While many BJ AM examples utilize
   biodegradable, water-soluble and recyclable polymers for biomedical and
   industrial applications, a wider array of opportunities exist to
   degrade, dissolve and reuse printed materials. Systematically shifting
   to these polymers will facilitate reuse and recycling of both binders
   and powders, but more studies to improve part strength are required.
   This review describes an overview of polymer jettability and a
   perspective into opportunities currently underutilized in transitioning
   BJ AM into a more sustainable AM platform. (c) 2020 Society of

Abstract = {Large scale additive manufacturing (AM) of fiber-reinforced polymer
   composites has gained traction in the mold and die community over the
   last decade, largely due to reduced material cost and lead time.
   However, limitations in mold size remain present due to printer volume
   constraints and costs associated with large format machines. This paper
   describes a method for producing additively manufactured polymer molds
   in segments with an O-ring joint design, which can be machined and
   subsequently assembled for autoclave applications. The developed joining
   mechanism allows for maintaining the vacuum integrity during the cure
   cycle while accounting for the anisotropic nature of the additively
   manufactured polymer molds. Over a range of tested temperatures, 20-200
   degrees C, the multi-part mold joining design was able to achieve full
   vacuum of-73.7 cmHg (29 inchHg) and maintain a vacuum integrity with
   vacuum losses less than 1.5 cmHg/5min (0.6 inchHg).(c) 2022 Society of

Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Ceramic materials are used in various industrial applications, as they
   possess exceptional physical, chemical, thermal, mechanical, electrical,
   magnetic, and optical properties. Ceramic structural components,
   especially those with highly complex structures and shapes, are
   difficult to fabricate with conventional methods, such as sintering and
   hot isostatic pressing (HIP). The use of preceramic polymers has many
   advantages, such as excellent processibility, easy shape change, and
   tailorable composition for fabricating high-performance ceramic
   components. Additive manufacturing (AM) is an evolving manufacturing
   technique that can be used to construct complex and intricate structural
   components. Integrating polymer-derived ceramics and AM techniques has
   drawn significant attention, as it overcomes the limitations and
   challenges of conventional fabrication approaches. This review discusses
   the current research that used AM technologies to fabricate ceramic
   articles from preceramic feedstock materials, and it demonstrates that
   AM processes are effective and versatile approaches for fabricating
   ceramic components. The future of producing ceramics using preceramic
   feedstock materials for AM processes is also discussed at the end.},

Abstract = {The present study relates to Polymers Additive Manufacturing (PAM)
   traditionally used for rapid prototyping operations. The use of PAM
   components as functional parts is still marginal compared to injection
   molded components. This is due to the uncertainty on their mechanical
   properties and to the present knowledge on PAM products. A new additive
   manufacturing technology has been integrated in the free former-Arburg
   machine. It was inspired by injection molding technology and creates
   plastic parts using layers built up from tiny droplets of polymer. In
   this work, the mechanical characterization of thermoplastic polymer
   parts obtained by Arburg Plastic Free forming (APF) is studied.
   Additionally the mechanical properties of polymer specimens obtained by
   injection molding as a conventional process are studied in order to
   evaluate the influence of the manufacturing process on the parts
   mechanical behavior. The tensile mechanical properties are evaluated by
   varying some manufacturing parameters, such as the printing path.
   Microstructural analyses have been performed to better understand the
   relationship between the manufacturing process and the final mechanical
   properties.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has emerged as a transformative technology
   capable of fabricating complex geometries and multi-material structures
   across various industries. Despite its potential, challenges persist in
   terms of limited material selection, anisotropic properties, and
   achieving functional microstructures in polymer and metal composites.
   Field-assisted additive manufacturing (FAAM) employs external fields
   like acoustic, magnetic, and electric fields. It has shown promise in
   addressing these limitations by controlling filler orientation and
   concentration in polymeric composites and improving surface finish and
   microstructure in metals. This review paper provides a comprehensive
   analysis of the state-of-the-art FAAM processes for polymer and metal
   composites, focusing on material compatibility, the mechanics of each
   field, and their integration with AM technologies as well as current
   applications, limitations, and potential future directions in the
   development of FAAM processes. Enhancing FAAM process understanding can
   create tailored anisotropic composites, enabling innovative applications
   in aerospace, automotive, biomedical fields, and beyond.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) processes are increasingly used in
   dentistry. The underlying process is the joining of material layer by
   layer based on 3D data models. Four additive processes (laser
   stereolithography, polymer jetting, digital light processing, fused
   deposition modeling) are mainly used for processing dental polymers. The
   number of polymer materials that can be used for AM in dentistry is
   small compared to other areas. Applications in dentistry using AM are
   limited (e.g. study models, maxillo-facial prostheses, orthodontic
   appliances etc.). New and further developments of materials are
   currently taking place due to the increasing demand for safer and other
   applications. Biocompatibility and the possibility of using materials
   not only as temporarily but as definitive reconstructions under oral
   conditions, mechanically more stable materials where less or no
   post-processing is needed are current targets in AM technologies.
   Printing parameters are also open for further development where optical
   aspects are also important.},

   polymer additive manufacturing through thermal annealing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {While additive manufacturing offers significant advantages compared to
   traditional manufacturing technologies, deterioration in thermal and
   mechanical properties compared to properties of the underlying materials
   is a serious concern. In the context of polymer extrusion based additive
   manufacturing, post-process approaches, such as thermal annealing have
   been reported for improving mechanical properties based on reptation of
   polymer chains and enhanced filament-to-filament adhesion. However,
   there is a lack of similar work for improving thermal properties such as
   thermal conductivity. This paper reports significant enhancement in
   build-direction thermal conductivity of polymer extrusion based parts as
   a result of thermal annealing. Over 150\% improvement is observed when
   annealed at 135 degrees C for 96 h. The effect of annealing temperature
   and time on thermal conductivity enhancement is investigated through
   experiments. A theoretical model based on Arrhenius kinetics for neck
   growth and a heat transfer model for the consequent impact on
   inter-layer thermal contact resistance is developed. Predicted thermal
   conductivity enhancement is found to be in good agreement with
   experimental data for a wide range of annealing temperature and time.
   The theoretical model may play a key role in developing practical
   thermal annealing strategies that account for the multiple constraints
   involved in annealing of polymer parts. This work may facilitate the use
   of polymer extrusion additive manufacturing for producing enhanced
   thermal conductivity parts capable of withstanding thermal loads.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as additive manufacturing,
   permits the fabrication of fully customized objects with a high level of
   geometrical complexity at reduced fabrication time and cost. Besides
   metals and ceramics, polymers have become a widely researched class of
   materials for applications in AM. The synthetic versatility and
   adaptability, as well as the wide range of properties that can be
   achieved using polymer materials, have rendered polymers the most widely
   employed class of materials for AM methodologies, In this review, the
   basic principles, considering the printing mechanism as well as the
   advantages and disadvantages, of the most relevant polymer AM
   technologies are described. The particular features, properties and
   limitations of currently employed polymer systems in the various AM
   technology areas are presented and analyzed. Subsequently, 4D printing,
   that is the fabrication of 3D printed structures that are cabable to
   change with time, is discussed. A brief description of the polymeric
   materials and technologies under development for 4D printed structures
   as well as the different shape changes explored are presented. Finally,
   based on the characteristics of the polymers employed for each
   technology illustrative examples of the principal applications are
   discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A reliability engineering program must be implemented from the
   conceptual phase of the physical asset to define the performance
   requirements of the components and equipment. Thus, in this work, the
   aim is to find the most optimal solution to manufacture polymer-based
   parts for the nuclear power industry using additive manufacturing
   routes. This case study application has been selected because polymers
   processed by additive manufacturing (AM) can be well suited for nuclear
   applications. The methodology includes-firstly-an analysis of the
   suitability of materials based on high-temperature resistance, thermal
   aging and irradiation tolerance, considering operation conditions.
   Secondly, an analysis of materials' processability considering their
   associated AM routes is performed based on thermal analysis and
   evaluation of physical properties of materials. A final assessment
   integrating the in-service suitability and AM processability is
   performed using a reliability approach, solving different emerging
   objective conflicts through defined constraints and selection criteria.
   According to the integrated in-service performance evaluation:
   Polypropylene-ethylene polyallomer (PPP), Epoxy (EP), Phenolics (Ph),
   Polyurethane (PU) and Acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) are the best
   options for mild operation conditions and EP, Ph and PU, considering
   high temperature along with radiation exposure. Considering AM
   techniques: EP and Ph can be manufactured using VAT
   photopolymerization-stereolithography (VP-SLA) with a good expected
   processability being these materials valid for high temperature
   environments. Consequently, this research work analyzes the viability,
   processability and in-service behavior of parts.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a proposal to synthetize a thermoplastic polymer
   from glycerol designed to be used as feedstock for additive
   manufacturing (AM) based on the material extrusion (ME) principle. A
   first round of synthesis was carried out considering different variables
   to search a thermoplastic solid without stickiness. After the evaluation
   of some AM-ME basic requirements, two other synthesis groups (the second
   and third rounds) were prepared to verify a proper catalyst amount and
   reaction time. These trial samples were characterized by infrared
   spectrometry and thermogravimetric analysis. The material obtained which
   was considered the most suitable showed an amorphous structure and a
   glass transition slightly below room temperature. In the end, this
   polymer was used as feedstock to print basic geometric specimens and
   evaluate both filament and layer adhesion. The result suggests the
   feasibility to synthetize a thermoplastic polymer from glycerol for
   AM-ME technology. The polymer obtained from the renewable resource has
   the potential to become an option for this technology. However, further
   studies considering additives are required to improve the polymer
   properties, starting by increasing its glass transition temperature. In
   summary, the polymer obtained from the renewable resource has the
   potential to become an option for AM-ME technology.},

Title = {Mechanical strength of welding zones produced by polymer extrusion
   additive manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Pages = {162-166},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {As more manufacturing processes and research institutions adopt
   customized manufacturing as a key element in their design strategies and
   finished products, the resulting mechanical properties of parts produced
   through additive manufacturing (AM) must be characterized and
   understood. In polymer extrusion (PE), the most recently extruded
   polymer filament must bond to the previously extruded filament via
   polymer diffusion to form a ``weld{''}. The strength of the weld limits
   the performance of the manufactured part and is controlled through
   processing conditions. Understanding the role of processing conditions,
   specifically extruder velocity and extruder temperature, on the overall
   strength of the weld will allow optimization of PE-AM parts. Here, the
   fracture toughness of a single weld is determined through a facile
   ``trouser tear{''} Mode III fracture experiment. The actual weld
   thickness is observed directly by optical microscopy (OM)
   characterization of cross sections of PE-AM samples. Representative data
   of weld strength as a function of printing parameters on a commercial 3D
   printer demonstrates the robustness of the method. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {Fused deposition modeling's (FDM) throughput is limited by process
   physics as well as practical considerations favoring single-head polymer
   extrusion. To expedite the thermoplastic additive manufacturing process,
   we propose a parallelized material deposition process called local
   viscosity control (LVC) additive manufacturing. LVC prints an entire
   layer in one step by selectively modulating the viscosity of polymer
   feedstock in contact with a heated wire mesh. Layers of molten polymer
   are contact printed, with the relative motion between the wire mechanism
   and a build plate allowing wetting and surface tension to transfer
   selectively heated, lower viscosity regions of polymer to a fixed
   substrate. Experiments demonstrate the viability of this process using a
   single cell depositing layered polycarbonate pixels. Theoretical
   analysis shows this process may offer similar capabilities in resolution
   to conventional FDM with a significantly higher production rate for
   commonly available input power.},

   extrusion deposition additive manufacturing},
Journal = {COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {230},
Number = {2},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {This work focuses on the evolution of interlayer fracture toughness
   properties of fiber-reinforced, semi-crystalline polymers in the
   extrusion deposition additive manufacturing (EDAM) process. Further,
   this work bridges the gap between the additive process conditions
   (time-temperature history) and the effective layer-to-layer fracture
   properties developed within a printed component. This is the first step
   to predict delamination that can occur during printing, during cooling
   to room temperature after printing, and during service performance of an
   additively manufactured geometry. A phenomenological model is developed
   for fusion bonding of semicrystalline polymer matrix composites by
   coupling the interdiffusion of polymer chains with the evolution of
   polymer crystallinity. While the interdiffusion is captured by reptation
   theory of polymer dynamics, the evolution of crystallinity is modeled by
   phenomenological crystallization kinetics and crystal melting dynamics.
   Further, a methodology is developed to determine the critical strain
   energy release rate, GICof the interlayer interface and experiments are
   conducted utilizing the double cantilever beam fracture test geometry.
   Predictions of GIC as a function of thermal history are compared with
   experiments.},

Journal = {PROGRESS IN MATERIALS SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Artificially structured ceramic components with extraordinary properties
   are of immense demand in various industries. Additive manufacturing (AM)
   or 3D printing technologies are promising for the fabrication of ceramic
   components. However, printing of ceramics directly from their raw
   powders is a daunting task and requires multistep processing. Preceramic
   polymers (PCPs) offer an attractive pathway towards AM of preceramic
   structures featuring heterogeneous architectures and their direct
   conversion to polymer-derived ceramics (PDCs) - the corresponding
   ceramics. This review reports a detailed summary of recent research
   progress on the additive manufacturing of PCPs and the corresponding
   PDCs manufactured for different applications. The approaches towards the
   synthesis of various PCPs are discussed along with easily tunable
   chemical formulations that can be employed in AM processes. Further, the
   review discusses conventional PDC technology as well as AM technologies
   that can be employed with PCPs and the associated superiorities and
   drawbacks in comparison to powder-based ceramic 3D printing.
   Complex-shaped PDC structures and their properties and potential
   applications are also discussed. Overall, this review illustrates the AM
   capabilities of PCPs for cost-effective fabrication of advanced ceramics
   with high resolution, superior performance, lower environmental impact
   and new functionalities.},

Journal = {COMPOSITES COMMUNICATIONS},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The development of additive manufacturing (AM) has revolutionized the
   fabrication process of continuous fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP)
   composites with its outstanding ability to create products that are
   complex in material, structure, and function. However, existing studies
   mostly focus on the manufacturing process without paying sufficient
   attention to exploring new design opportunities enabled by CFRP-AM. This
   paper outlines the design concept for additive manufacturing of
   continuous fiber reinforced polymer composites, aiming to improve
   existing products' performance and foster product innovations for future
   needs. More specifically, existing CFRPAM techniques are reviewed from
   the perspective of functional requirements. Design opportunities within
   the material, process, and structure domains are identified. Also, novel
   applications enabled by design for CFRP-AM on shape morphing, sensing,
   and energy storage are presented. The review concludes with a brief
   discussion and an outlook on future work.},

Title = {A process-structure-performance modeling for thermoplastic polymers via
   material extrusion additive manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Qualities of polymeric parts fabricated by material extrusion (ME)
   additive manufacturing is sensitive to the processing conditions.
   However, the linkages among ME polymers' mesostructure, effective
   properties, and printing conditions are still not clear enough. In this
   context, the present work aims to establish a model capable of
   estimating the structure and elastic properties of unidirectionally
   extruded thermoplastic polymers just by setting printing conditions and
   intrinsic material properties as primary variables. To this end,
   according to the principle of mass conservation and a thermal-sintering
   model, the geometry of ME polymers, characterized by strands' shape,
   size, and the bonding condition, are predicted firstly. Next, based on
   the representative volume element (RVE), numerical homogenization is
   conducted via the finite element method to gain the products'
   orthotropic properties. Tests on ME Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene
   (ABS) products are also made. Our experimental results, together with
   the existing experimental data, verified the present model. Furthermore,
   parametric analyses are carried out. Effects of layer thickness,
   printing speed, flaw rate and extrusion temperature et al. on ME
   polymers' porosity and mechanical behaviors are revealed, which may have
   important implications in the future ME additive manufacturing of
   thermoplastic polymers.},

Abstract = {The development of additive manufacturing methods has enlarged rapidly
   in recent years. Thereby, the work mainly focuses on the realization of
   mechanical components, but the additive manufacturing technology offers
   a high potential in the field of optics as well. Owing to new design
   possibilities, completely new solutions are possible. This article
   briefly reviews and compares the most important additive manufacturing
   methods for polymer optics. Additionally, it points out the
   characteristics of additive manufactured polymer optics. Thereby,
   surface quality is of crucial importance. In order to improve it,
   appropriate post-processing steps are necessary (e.g. robot polishing or
   coating), which will be discussed. An essential part of this paper deals
   with various additive manufactured optical components and their use,
   especially in optical systems for shape metrology (e.g. borehole sensor,
   tilt sensor, freeform surface sensor, fisheye lens). The examples should
   demonstrate the potentials and limitations of optical components
   produced by additive manufacturing.},

Abstract = {Selective laser sintering (SLS) is an additive manufacturing (AM)
   process that yields excellent part qualities with good mechanical
   properties. The SLS process employs micron-sized polymer particles,
   which are selectively fused by a laser. While there seem to be hardly
   any boundaries regarding design, there are quite some restrictions
   concerning the variety of commercially available SLS materials. With a
   market share of roughly 90\%, polyamide 12 (PA12) is currently the most
   widely used polymer material for SLS. In order to increase the
   understanding of the precipitation based manufacturing process for
   polyamide powders, production of polyamide 11 powders via precipitation
   in ethanol was investigated. The polymer particles need to be optimized
   regarding size, shape, flowability and packing characteristics. In this
   contribution particle manufacturing via liquid-liquid phase separation
   is discussed. Bulk polymer material of polyamide 11 is directly
   converted to spherical micron sized particles in a single unit
   operation. The produced particles are characterized regarding their size
   and morphology. Furthermore, also structural characteristics,
   crystallinity and flowability are analyzed and the product properties
   are correlated with process parameters. We discuss the potential of this
   process for the production of novel, easy-to-handle polymer particle
   systems for SLS.},

Abstract = {This research aimed at evaluating which of the polymers commonly used
   for rapid prototyping in the process of additive manufacturing can also
   meet the functional requirements in the preparation of final parts. In
   particular, the investigation was focused on a water pump impeller as a
   practical case study. A comparison between mechanical properties was
   proposed for this scope. ABSplus, ABS and PLA polymers were considered.
   Materials were tested in tensile and bending conditions. Results showed
   that ABSplus and ABS polymers satisfy all the mechanical requirements,
   while PLA fails. Then, the impellers were built-in and tested. All
   functional requirements, together with the necessary stability were
   verified. In this way, it was proved that, by selecting a suitable
   polymer, additive manufacturing can be successfully used to produce
   complex final elements, thus leading to extremely fast production, high
   accuracy and precision and even lower costs compared to other

Abstract = {The additive manufacturing of small diameter polypropylene microfibers
   is described, achieved using a technique termed melt electrospinning
   writing. Sequential fiber layering, which is important for accurate
   three-dimensional fabrication, was achieved with the smallest fiber
   diameter of 16.4 +/- 0.2 mu m obtained. The collector speed, temperature
   and melt flow rate to the nozzle were optimized for quality and minimal
   fiber pulsing. Of particular importance to the success of this method is
   appropriate heating of the collector plate, so that the
   electrostatically drawn filament adheres during the direct-writing
   process. By demonstrating the direct-writing of polypropylene, new
   applications exploiting the favorable mechanical, stability and
   biocompatible properties of this polymer are envisaged. (C) 2017

   of functional final parts. Initial research has been performed targeting
   the integration of fibers into additive manufactured plastic composites.
   Major advantages, among others, are for example increased tensile

   are proper fiber placement, fiber seizing, an increased knowledge in the
   used materials and how they are applied into engineering solutions
   through proper control of the additive manufacturing process. The aim of
   this research is the improved understanding of fiber-reinforcement in
   additive manufacturing in terms of production and application. Vat
   polymerization and material extrusion techniques for composite additive
   manufacturing were investigated with respect of increasing adhesion
   between the matrix material and the fibers. Process optimization was

Title = {Material extrusion for ceramic additive manufacturing with polymer- free
   ceramic precursor binder},
Journal = {MATERIALS \& DESIGN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {221},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing of dense ceramic products has been challenging
   because of the high polymeric content of the ceramic feedstock
   materials. Several studies have been conducted to increase the ceramic
   content in the feedstock, but the binder and additives in it have
   remained in the polymeric content. A novel strategy for highly dense
   additive manufacturing using a sol-gel-based ceramic slurry without
   polymeric additives is presented. Alumina, which is the most widely used
   fine ceramic, was chosen as a representative ceramic material. The
   proposed sol-gel solution enabled a high solid loading of approx-imately
   50 vol\% without any polymeric dispersant while satisfying the
   requirements for material extru-sion process, such as extrudable
   viscosity (<100 Pa.s) and self-sustainable yield stress. This novel
   sol-gel binder system evolves into aluminum oxide nanoparticles during
   the sintering process, eventually fusing to the alumina particles. The
   as-printed green body possessed high alumina content and 66\% of
   theoret-ical density, which was higher than that obtained via the
   conventional molding methods. A reduced lin-ear shrinkage of less than
   16\% and a high density of 99.5\% of the theoretical value were also
   achieved. This research would present a practical strategy for ceramic
   additive manufacturing as an emerging fabrica-tion process. (c) 2022 The

   polysilazane with commercial acrylic resin and photoinitiator. The
   material formulation and the structure of the green body were
   characterized by using FTIR. Si3N4 ceramic cuboid, 2D-structured Si3N4
   ceramic honeycomb, and 2D-structured Si3N4 ceramic lattice with high
   precision were fabricated. The DLP-prepared specimens were pyrolyzed at
   different temperatures, and the crystalline phases after pyrolysis were
   analyzed by using XRD. The optimal pyrolysis temperature was found to be
   1400 degrees C.microstructures were characterized by using SEM. The
   compressive behavior of the complex-shaped Si3N4 ceramic structures was
   measured and discussed in detail.},

Abstract = {In this paper an integrated methodology for implants personalized
   manufacturing is presented. This methodology materializes the hybrid
   material implants manufacturing through the integration of two or more
   advanced Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies. Furthermore, high
   strength biomechanical implants with optimized geometry and mass can be
   manufactured by biomimetic concepts application. The combination of
   polymers and ceramics or polymers and metal materials (or metal alloys)
   allows a significant leap in the development and production of a great
   diversity of components and applications. The combination of advanced
   additive manufacturing processes, e.g. the Selective Laser Melting (SLM)
   or Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) and the StereoLithography (SL), make
   possible the production of parts with almost unlimited geometric freedom
   and custom multimaterial. The manufacturing flexibility and the
   processing capacity of the different combinations of materials -
   metal/polymer - obtained from hybrid additive manufacturing systems -
   SLM/SL - are demonstrated here by the manufacture of a dental bridge
   implant. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access

Journal = {RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},

Number = {2},
Pages = {379-398},
Month = {FEB 26},
Abstract = {Purpose - A review on additive manufacturing (AM) of shape memory
   polymer composites (SMPCs) is put forward to highlight the progress made
   up to date, conduct a critical review and show the limitations and
   possible improvements in the different research areas within the
   different AM techniques. The purpose of this study is to identify
   academic and industrial opportunities.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper introduces the reader to
   three-dimensional (3 D) and four-dimensional printing of shape memory
   polymers (SMPs). Specifically, this review centres on manufacturing
   technologies based on material extrusion, photopolymerization,
   powder-based and lamination manufacturing processes. AM of SMPC was
   classified according to the nature of the filler material: particle
   dispersed, i.e. carbon, metallic and ceramic and long fibre reinforced
   materials, i.e. carbon fibres. This paper makes a distinction for
   multi-material printing with SMPs, as multi-functionality and exciting
   applications can be proposed through this method. Manufacturing
   strategies and technologies for SMPC are addressed in this review and
   opportunities in the research are highlighted.
   Findings - This paper denotes the existing limitations in the current AM
   technologies and proposes several directions that will contribute to
   better use and improvements in the production of additive manufactured
   SMPC. With advances in AM technologies, gradient changes in material
   properties can open diverse applications of SMPC. Because of
   multi-material printing, co-manufacturing sensors to 3D printed smart
   structures can bring this technology a step closer to obtain full
   control of the shape memory effect and its characteristics. This paper
   discusses the novel developments in device and functional part design
   using SMPC, which should be aided with simple first stage design models
   followed by complex simulations for iterative and optimized design. A
   change in paradigm for designing complex structures is still to be made
   from engineers to exploit the full potential of additive manufactured
   SMPC structures.
   Originality/value - Advances in AM have opened the gateway to the
   potential design and fabrication of functional parts with SMPs and their
   composites. There have been many publications and reviews conducted in
   this area; yet, many mainly focus on SMPs and reserve a small section to
   SMPC. This paper presents a comprehensive review directed solely on the
   AM of SMPC while highlighting the research opportunities.},

Title = {Overcoming limitations of polymer additive manufacturing for snap-fit
   joint design and part assembly},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 21},
Abstract = {Polymer additive manufacturing has been widely used across a variety of
   industries due to its design flexibility advantage and rapid prototyping
   capabilities. However, there are still limitations that prevent the full
   potential of this technology from being exploited. One of these
   limitations has to do with the necessity of assembly and disassembly of
   manufactured parts to ease the installation of inner components.
   Notably, snap-fit joints have proven to be a very useful coupling
   mechanism when trying to assemble two or more parts. However, they can
   be challenging to design, particularly when using additive manufacturing
   processes. Consequently, this paper discusses the use of polymer
   additive manufacturing, specifically in the context of snap-fit joint
   design and part assembly. An extended design methodology is proposed,
   ranging from global considerations on material properties and technology
   used for in-detail considerations concerning part geometry and coupling
   mechanisms. The methodology is based on a systematic approach of design
   for additive manufacturing and evaluation of the snap-fit joints.
   Additionally, a process for estimating the quantity of required joint
   elements is included in the methodology, which is a novel contribution
   to the literature in this field. Ultimately, the proposed design process
   is demonstrated in a case study including snap-fit joints for part
   assembly. The results suggest that, by applying the proposed
   methodology, designers can overcome the limitations of polymer additive
   manufacturing and achieve successful designs of complex parts with
   snap-fit joints as coupling elements.},

Abstract = {The aim of the present paper is to give an up-to date on computer aided
   design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) additive techniques and synthetic
   polymers for bone reconstruction in the maxillofacial region. Additive
   manufacturing represents a promising field for future research in bone
   replacement/regeneration. However, standard guidelines for mimicking
   clinical environment with the different bone characteristics are
   strongly required. The rapid prototyping techniques, particularly,
   bioprinting allows the construct of 3D living functional tissues able to
   replace, in the near future, large defects caused by tumor excision,
   trauma, clefts or infections, limiting the autogenous bone graft
   requirement.},

Abstract = {Conducting polymers (CPs) have been attracting great attention in the
   development of (bio)electronic devices. Most of the current devices are
   rigid two-dimensional systems and possess uncontrollable geometries and
   architectures that lead to poor mechanical properties presenting
   ion/electronic diffusion limitations. The goal of the article is to
   provide an overview about the additive manufacturing (AM) of conducting
   polymers, which is of paramount importance for the design of future
   wearable three-dimensional (3D) (bio)electronic devices. Among different
   3D printing AM techniques, inkjet, extrusion, electrohydrodynamic, and
   light-based printing have been mainly used. This review article collects
   examples of 3D printing of conducting polymers such as
   poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene), polypyrrole, and polyaniline. It also
   shows examples of AM of these polymers combined with other polymers
   and/or conducting fillers such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and silver
   nanowires. Afterward, the foremost applications of CPs processed by 3D
   printing techniques in the biomedical and energy fields, that is,
   wearable electronics, sensors, soft robotics for human motion, or health
   monitoring devices, among others, will be discussed.},

Journal = {SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES},

Volume = {28},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Conjugated polymers are a class of electroactive active material that
   have been studied for their potential in advanced sensing and actuation
   technologies. Conventional methods to fabricate conjugated polymer
   transducers produce devices with planar morphologies that limit
   fabricated devices to simplistic linear or bending modes of operation.
   To overcome this limitation, this work develops a photosensitive
   polypyrrole formulation and light-based additive manufacturing method
   capable of realizing three-dimensional conjugated polymer structures
   with micro-scale features. The electroactivity and strain sensing
   properties of the photosensitive polymer formulation are reported to
   show the early development of this method towards new sensing and
   actuation technologies.},

Abstract = {Since additive manufacturing processes, as we know them today, were
   invented in the mid-1980s, there has being an upsurge in its use as a
   bona fide manufacturing technique. Additive manufacturing has entered
   the space of biomedical applications where teeth retainers and hearing
   aids are commonly produced by this technique with the latter almost
   exclusively made so. This appears to be only the tip of the iceberg but
   there are a number of challenges, in terms of the process and materials,
   which must be overcome before the additive technique becomes dominant in
   mainstream manufacturing. As these are overcome, other challenges will
   arise such as standardisation, inspection, business models and, of
   course, unexpected consequences. Nevertheless, the advantages of
   additive manufacturing will ensure that it has a key role to play in
   biomedical applications.},

   additive manufacturing},
Journal = {COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {242},
Month = {SEP 29},
Abstract = {The material anisotropy induced by the related additive manufacturing
   (AM) extrusion process and the geometric errors introduced into the unit
   lattices by the stair-stepping artifacts were coupled in the topology
   optimization model to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the optimal
   design for the fibre reinforced polymer lattice structures. The material
   properties of the 3D printed carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP)
   were firstly systematically investigated by extensive tensile tests
   aided by the digital image correlation (DIC) system, through which the
   microscale material anisotropy was clarified. Moreover, the accurate
   orthotropic material models were introduced into the as-fabricated
   mesoscale unit lattices with geometric errors to obtain the effective
   mechanical properties. Finally, mechanical performance of the macroscale
   structures was optimized by the integration of the ideal and
   as-fabricated unit lattices with the homogenization-based topology
   optimization method. The AM process-induced material anisotropy and
   geometric errors result in significant deviations of the mechanical
   property of the topologically optimized macrostructures and more
   accurate topology optimization results can be achieved considering the
   microscale material anisotropy and the geometric error in the mesoscale
   unit lattice. The results obtained in this investigation indicate that
   it is essential to comprehensively consider the AM processinduced
   microscale material anisotropy and mesoscale geometric errors in the
   topology optimization of fibre reinforced polymer lattice structures to
   improve the accuracy and reliability of the optimal design.},

Abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) is two decade old technology; where parts
   are build layer manufacturing method directly from a CAD template. Over
   the years, AM techniques changes the future way of part fabrication with
   enhanced intricacy and custom-made features are aimed. Commercially
   polymers, metals, ceramic and metal-polymer composites are in practice
   where polymers enhanced the expectations in AM and are considered as a
   kind of next industrial revolution. Growing trend in polymer application
   motivated to study their feasibility and properties. Laser sintering,
   Heat sintering and Inhibition sintering are the most successful AM

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to investigate the influence of additive
   manufactured polymer injection moulds on the mechanical properties of
   moulded parts. Therefore, polymer moulds are used to inject standard
   specimens to compare material properties to specimens produced using a
   conventional aluminium tool.
   Design/methodology/approach PolyJet technology is used to
   three-dimensional (3D)-print a mould insert in Digital ABS and selective
   laser sintering (SLS) technology is used to 3D-print a mould insert in
   polyamide (PA) 3200 GF. A conventionally aluminium milled tool serves as
   reference. Standard specimens are produced to compare resulting
   mechanical properties, shrinkage behaviour and morphology.
   Findings The determined material characteristics of the manufactured
   prototypes from the additive manufactured tools show differences in
   terms of mechanical behaviour to those from the aluminium reference
   tool. The most significant differences are an up to 25 per cent lower
   tensile elongation and an up to 63 per cent lower elongation at break
   resulting in an embrittlement of the specimens produced. These
   differences seem to be mainly due to the different morphological
   structure caused by the lower thermal conductivity and greater surface
   roughness of the polymer tools.
   Research limitations/implications The determined differences in
   mechanical behaviour can partly be assigned to differences in surface
   roughness and morphological structure of the resulting parts. The exact
   extend of either cause, however, cannot be clearly determined.
   Originality/value This study provides a comparison between the part
   material properties from conventionally milled aluminium tools and
   polymer inserts manufactured via additive tooling.},

Abstract = {The emanating paragon of personalized medical care utilizes discrete
   patient data to customize clinical therapy. While the principal cynosure
   so far is the formulation of ameliorated therapeutics contingent on
   ``omics{''} data, the notion outstretches all embodiments of customized
   treatment. Howbeit, the dearth of in vitro tissue and organ models
   competent of mimicking human physiology gravely impede the development
   and clinical translation of drugs and therapies with higher in vivo
   efficiency. Bioprinting (a form of additive manufacturing) enables us to
   effectively address the perpetual limitations for the manufacturing of
   hierarchically organized living constructs with complex structural and
   functional organization through the precise spatial positioning of
   multiple materials and cells. Additive manufacturing translates
   computer-aided design virtual 3D models into physical objects. By
   digital splicing of tomographic data, 3D scan, or computer-aided design,
   layer-by-layer fabrication of target objects can be achieved bereft the
   requirement for molds or machining. As polymeric materials are by far
   the most exploited class of materials, the anecdote discusses the
   processing of polymers and the development of polymers and advanced
   polymeric systems, especially for bioprinting. Facets of polymer design,
   additives, and processing parameters as they harmonize to exalting build
   speed and improved veracity, stability, functionality, mechanical
   attributes, porosity, and surface finish are explored. As the field
   matures, additive manufacturing is poised to proffer patient-specific
   tissue and organ substitutes, reproducible microtissues for drug
   screening and disease modeling, personalized drug delivery systems, as
   well as customized medical devices; therefore, we also highlight the
   most pressing challenges facing the research domain to revolutionize

Abstract = {Polymer materials produced by additive manufacturing undergo significant
   changes in their dimensions under continuous loading conditions. This
   situation affects the operation of polymer structures produced by
   additive manufacturing within safe limits. Therefore, it is crucial to
   determine the creep behaviour of polymers produced by the additive
   manufacturing method. This study investigates the creep behaviour of six
   different materials, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), chlorinated
   polyethylene (CPE), polylactic acid (PLA), tough polylactic acid (TPLA),
   polycarbonates (PC), and nylon most commonly used in additive
   manufacturing. The creep test specimens are firstly produced with a
   three-dimensional (3D) printer, and then their final dimensions are
   given using computer numerical control (CNC) milling. The creep
   experiments are carried out at three different ambient temperatures (25
   degrees C, 40 degrees C, and 60 degrees C) and two different stress
   levels (10 MPa, 20 MPa). According to the test results, it was
   determined that the material type, temperature, and loading levels
   significantly influenced the creep behaviour of the 3D printed polymer
   materials.},

Abstract = {Extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) enables the fabrication of
   three-dimensional structures with intricate cellular architectures where
   the material is selectively dispensed through a nozzle or orifice in a
   layer-by-layer fashion at the macro-, meso-, and micro-scale. Polymers
   and their composites are one of the most widely used materials and are
   of great interest in the field of AM due to their vast potential for
   various applications, especially for the medical, military, aerospace,
   and automotive industries. Because architected polymer-based structures
   impart remarkably improved material properties such as low density and
   high mechanical performance compared to their bulk counterparts, this
   review focuses particularly on the development of such objects by
   extrusion-based AM intended for structural applications. This review
   introduces the extrusion-based AM techniques followed by a discussion on
   the wide variety of materials used for extrusion printing, various
   architected structures, and their mechanical properties. Notable
   advances in newly developed polymer and composite materials and their
   potential applications are summarized. Finally, perspectives and
   insights into future research of extrusion-based AM on developing
   high-performance ultra-light materials using polymers and their
   composite materials are discussed.},

Abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies can be widely used for
   producing detailed geometries based on individual and particular
   demands. Some applications are related to the production of personalized
   devices, implants (orthopedic and dental), drug dosage forms
   (antibacterial, immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, etc.), or 3D
   implants that contain active pharmaceutical treatments, which favor
   cellular proliferation and tissue regeneration. This review is focused
   on the generation of 3D printed polymer-based objects that present
   antibacterial properties. Two main different alternatives of obtaining
   these 3D printed objects are fully described, which employ different
   polymer sources. The first one uses natural polymers that, in some
   cases, already exhibit intrinsic antibacterial capacities. The second
   alternative involves the use of synthetic polymers, and thus takes
   advantage of polymers with antimicrobial functional groups, as well as
   alternative strategies based on the modification of the surface of
   polymers or the elaboration of composite materials through adding
   certain antibacterial agents or incorporating different drugs into the
   polymeric matrix.},

Abstract = {Ideally, objects are constructed as quickly as possible; however, short
   build times for a layer can present an issue. Short layer build times do
   not provide enough time for the material to cool sufficiently. As a
   result, an object cannot support its own weight nor deal with
   overhanging features. Additionally, the generation of support structures
   may be impractical either due to geometry or, in the case of large-scale
   polymer additive manufacturing, due to being difficult to remove. To
   address these issues, researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory's
   Manufacturing Demonstration Facility investigated the use of a thermal
   camera mounted to a gantry to collect data on an object under
   construction. This data provided feedback for an in-situ control system
   to adjust layer build times. Adjustments were made in the form of
   additional waiting to allow the material to cool to specific thermal
   thresholds. This additional cooling time allowed the construction of
   objects with low layer build times or overhanging features that would
   have otherwise failed. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

   Manufacturing (AM) processes is a remarkable method at the micro
   dimensional scale. However, the measurement of complex micro products
   and the evaluation of the related uncertainty are still particularly

   proprietary Vat Photopolymerization machine able to produce micro
   features has been designed, built and validated. This study evaluates
   the capability of the machine in terms of printed dimensions and the
   corresponding uncertainty assessment. For this purpose, two test parts
   with micro features of different geometries and dimensions have been
   designed and five samples of each test part have been printed. The
   dimensions of the micro features have been evaluated for quality control
   capability assessment and to stablish procedures for verification of AM

Abstract = {Polymer nanocomposites represent a key addition to the palette of
   advanced polymeric materials available to us in the context of additive
   manufacturing. However, our understanding of their properties, and thus
   our ability to predict them and to design parts based on them, remains
   limited. With this in mind, nanolaminates have been formed via an
   additive process developed in our group and referred to as automated
   spray deposition; these materials have been characterized with the
   express purpose of better understanding the
   composition-structure-properties relations critical to our ability to
   create high performance polymeric materials by design via additive
   techniques. Here we present a preliminary comparison of the dynamic
   mechanical properties of two families of nanolaminates, essentially
   identical except for the polarity of the polymer phase and the strength
   of polymer / nanofiller interactions, with the aim of better
   understanding the mechanical response of such materials.},

Abstract = {The vast Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) waste accumulated is
   pressing for its recycling. A novel recycling approach, which integrated
   carbon fiber reclamation and composite additive manufacturing, is
   proposed to process the CFRP waste into three Dimensional (3D) parts. In
   the experiments, the CFRP waste was recycled by supercritical n-butanol
   to yield reclaimed Carbon Fibers (rCFs). The rCFs were ground by a ball
   mill, mixed with Poly-Ether-Ether-Ketone (PEEK) powder and then extruded
   to the composite filament. The filament was fed to the Fused Deposition
   Modeling (FDM) printer to fabricate 3D parts. Mechanical and electrical
   properties of the parts were investigated and compared with that of pure
   PEEK. The results illustrate that the additive manufacturing-based
   approach offers a potential strategy to reuse the CFRP waste and rapidly
   fabricate the rCF reinforced plastics with complex geometry and
   function. (C) 2020 CIRP. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Fiber reinforced polymer composites have been around for many decades
   but recently their use has started to increase in multiple industries
   such as automotive, aerospace, and construction. The conventional
   composite manufacturing processes such as wet lay-up, resin transfer
   molding, automatic lay ups etc. suffer from a lot of practical and
   material issues which have limited their use. The mechanical properties
   of the parts produced by such processes also suffer from variation that
   causes problems downstream. Composites based additive manufacturing
   processes such as Fused Deposition Modeling and Composite Filament
   Fabrication are trying to remove some of the barriers to the use of
   composites. Additive manufacturing processes offer more design and
   material freedom than conventional composite manufacturing processes.
   This paper compares conventional composite processes for the
   manufacturing of Epoxy-Fiberglass fiber reinforced polymers with
   composite filament fabrication based Nylon-Fiberglass fiber reinforced
   polymers. Mechanical properties such as tensile strength, elastic
   modulus, and fatigue life are compared for the different processes. The
   effect of process parameters on these mechanical properties for the
   composite filament fabrication based process is also examined in this
   work. It is found that the composite filament fabrication based process
   is very versatile and the parts manufactured by this process can be used
   in various applications.},

   material extrusion additive manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {132-141},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEAM), also known as
   three-dimensional (3D) printing, is a popular additive manufacturing
   technique suitable for producing 3D shapes using thermoplastic
   materials. The majority of companies that design and test 3D printing
   machines work with thermoplastic acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)
   and polylactic acid (PLA) filaments. It is, however, crucial to utilize
   different types of filaments for a broader range of applications with
   different mechanical property requirements. Shape memory polymers (SMPs)
   are smart materials that react to an applied stimulus in order to
   recover large strains. MEAM techniques may be used for the production of
   SMP-based parts, allowing for smart structures to be created in a wide
   variety of geometries. In this work, a commercial 3D-printer was used to
   produce 3D printed polyurethane-based SMP specimens. An annealing heat
   treatment was applied to some of the specimens. Mechanical and
   thermomechanical testing was conducted to study the effects of testing
   temperatures and annealing heat treatments on the tensile and shape
   memory properties of the samples. 3D printing was shown to be a suitable
   technique for producing SMP parts capable of retaining good shape memory
   characteristics. Different annealing heat treatments and test
   temperatures were found to have considerable effects on the SMP specimen
   properties. In particular, annealing the specimens at 85 degrees C for 2
   h helped to improve the rate of shape recovery and the consistency of
   mechanical test results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Polymer recycling in an open-source additive manufacturing context:
   Mechanical issues},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {87-105},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Nowadays, the low recycling rate of polymers is still a challenge to
   humankind due to energy, economic and logistical issues. In the context
   of additive manufacturing, there is an exponential use of thermoplastic
   materials in the industrial and public open-source additive
   manufacturing sector, leading to an increase in global polymer
   consumption and waste generation. However, the coupling of the
   open-source 3D printers with polymer processing could potentially offer
   the basis for a new paradigm of distributed recycling process. It could
   be a complementary alternative to the traditional paradigm of
   centralized recycling of polymers, which is often uneconomical and
   energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. In order to
   achieve this goal, a first step is to prove the technical feasibility to
   recycle thermoplastic material intended for open-source 3D printing
   feedstock.
   The contribution of the present study is twofold: first, a general
   methodology to evaluate the recyclability of thermoplastics used as
   feedstock in open-source 3D printing machines is proposed. Then, the
   proposed methodology is applied to the recycling study of polylactic
   acid (PLA) material addressed to the fused filament fabrication (FFF)
   technique, which is currently the most widely used. The main results of
   this application contribute to the understanding of the influence of the
   material's physico-chemical degradation on its mechanical properties as
   well as its potential distributed recyclability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The present work reports a novel approach to enhance the fracture
   resistance and notch sensitivity of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer
   composites utilizing additive manufacturing (3-D printing) fabrication.
   The 3-D printed composites utilize carbon fiber bundles to reinforce
   nylon/chopped fiber resin in a multilayered structure configuration.
   Single-edge (60 degrees) notched samples were printed using Mark Two
   printer. Three reinforcement schemes were designed and used to
   manufacture the specimens. The focus was placed on selective
   reinforcement at the crack tip to arrest crack initiation. The
   mechanical properties, fracture toughness, and fracture behavior of the
   printed composites were evaluated. It was found that wrapping fiber
   around the notch effectively blunted the notch and redirected crack
   propagation away from the notch tip, thereby lengthening the crack path
   and leading to improved fracture resistance. It was also found that such
   improvement reaches a saturation level. Excessive notch reinforcement
   beyond optimal limit can reverse the gains in fracture resistance due to
   notch-targeted reinforcement. Examination of the fracture surface
   morphology of the printed composites reveals lack of fusion of the
   sizing of the individual continuous carbon fiber bundles and the lack of
   adhesion between the matrix layers (nylon/chopped fiber resin) and the
   adjacent carbon fiber bundle reinforcement. Damage to the fibers within
   the carbon bundle was also observed. Thus, a synergetic effect of the
   carbon fiber bundles reinforcement and the matrix requires more
   optimization to manufacture carbon-reinforced polymer composites using
   3-D printing.},

Abstract = {Polyolefins are semi-crystalline thermoplastic polymers known for their
   good mechanical properties, low production cost, and chemical
   resistance. They are amongst the most commonly used plastics, and many
   polyolefin grades are regarded as engineering polymers. The two main
   additive manufacturing techniques that can be used to fabricate
   3D-printed parts are fused filament fabrication and selective laser
   sintering. Polyolefins, like polypropylene and polyethylene, can, in
   principle, be processed with both these techniques. However, the
   semi-crystalline nature of polyolefins adds complexity to the use of
   additive manufacturing methods compared to amorphous polymers. First,
   the crystallization process results in severe shrinkage upon cooling,
   while the processing temperature and cooling rate affect the mechanical
   properties and mesoscopic structure of the fabricated parts. In
   addition, for ultra-high-molecular weight polyolefins, limited chain
   diffusion is a major obstacle to achieving proper adhesion between
   adjunct layers. Finally, polyolefins are typically apolar polymers,
   which reduces the adhesion of the 3D-printed part to the substrate.
   Notwithstanding these difficulties, it is clear that the successful
   processing of polyolefins via additive manufacturing techniques would
   enable the fabrication of high-end engineering products with enormous
   design flexibility. In addition, additive manufacturing could be
   utilized for the increased recycling of plastics. This manuscript
   reviews the work that has been conducted in developing experimental
   protocols for the additive manufacturing of polyolefins, presenting a
   comparison between the different approaches with a focus on the use of
   polyethylene and polypropylene grades. This review is concluded with an
   outlook for future research to overcome the current challenges that
   impede the addition of polyolefins to the standard palette of materials
   processed through additive manufacturing.},

Abstract = {Composite polymer/ceramic filaments for material extrusion-based fused
   filament fabrication additive manufacturing, using barium strontium
   titanium oxide (BST) ceramics and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)
   thermoplastics were produced; their dielectric and physical properties

   relative permittivity (epsilon r), quality factor (Qxf) and dielectric
   loss (tan.5) were measured as a function of ceramic solid loading (\%)
   at 5 GHz for 3D printed samples. A relative permittivity epsilon(r) =
   6.05, Qxf = 10,433 GHz and dielectric loss tan.5 = 0.007 were obtained
   for a BST/ABS ceramic polymer composite, with 50 wt\% (15 vol\%) solid
   loading. The composite materials exhibit reduced dielectric losses
   compared to standard laminates currently used in the radiofrequency (RF)
   and telecommunications industry. Based on polymer/ ceramic composite
   filament, a prototype microstrip patch 5 G antenna and a hemispherical
   dielectric lens were designed and manufactured. Through testing, it
   shows good antenna performance with a centre frequency of f(0) = 3.78
   GHz and a (-10 dB) bandwidth of 90.6 MHz. The dielectric lens increased
   the antenna gain by 3.86 dBi.},

Title = {Additive Manufacturing of Polyaryletherketone (PAEK) polymers and their
   composites},
Journal = {COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {266},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Polyaryletherketone (PAEK) polymers are unique thermoplastics certified
   for aerospace and biomedical applications, demonstrating exceptional
   thermo-mechanical characteristics and superior chemical resistance. They
   are adaptable to material extrusion (ME) and laser powder bed fusion
   (L-PBF) additive manufacturing systems. While various PAEK grades for
   additive manufacturing (AM) exist, their printing suitability,
   especially inter-layer strength, is not well-understood. Adding small
   amounts of short carbon fibers to PAEKs enhances their stiffness and
   service temperature but modifies their processing, structure, and
   properties. This study examines the effects of the AM method (L-PBF and
   ME) and carbon fiber addition on the structure, mechanical properties,
   and crystallinity of three different PAEK polymers. We characterize and
   correlate tensile properties, fracture modes, degree of crystallinity,
   fiber length and orientations, and porosity of the samples. Our findings
   aim to refine AM processes and feedstock materials for semi-crystalline
   polymers and their composites, offering insights for designing robust,
   economical AM parts.},

Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing has developed significantly. In contrast to
   established fabricated materials, low-meltingpoint alloys (LMPAs) are
   increasingly attractive because they have favorable electrical/thermal
   conductivities and mechanical strengths. However, LMPA additive
   manufacturing is still in its infancy. We report a novel strategy for
   fabricating the complex and/or multifunctional components of LMPAs by
   extrusion additive manufacturing with two nozzles (for extruding the
   polymer and for extruding the LMPA). The proposed strategy was used to
   successfully fabricate complex LMPA components for the first time. We
   fabricated LMPA/polymer composite parts with improved mechanical
   properties, and implemented the integrated manufacturing of circuits and
   3D products. The strategy will enable the use of LMPAs in applications
   such as smart structures, electromagnetic shielding, biomedicine,
   thermal management, energy harvesting, and advanced electronics.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an approach combining additive manufacturing (AM)
   with carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) in an autoclave prepreg
   process for the development of complex-shaped hybrid AM-CFRP structures
   with the potential for individualization. The goal of this paper is to
   investigate the processing route in the context of low volume industrial
   applications and to assess the mechanical performance of hybrid AM-CFRP
   structures in ultimate strength and fatigue. The approach was applied to
   lower-limb prostheses using dissolvable in-autoclave tooling made of
   ST-130 by fused deposition modeling, two load introduction elements made
   of titanium by selective laser melting, and pre-impregnated carbon fiber
   reinforcements. The parts were cured in an autoclave at a pressure of 3
   bar and a temperature of 110 A degrees C. The inner toolings were
   dissolved in a basic solution after curing. The prostheses were
   subjected to ultimate strength and fatigue tests to assess the
   mechanical performance of the structures. Results show that the target
   load of 5474 N was exceeded by 40\% and that no fatigue failure occurred
   for the given loading. Weight savings of 28\% compared to a
   state-of-the-art aluminum reference part were achieved. Results
   demonstrate that the combination of technologies could be appropriate
   for high-performance lightweight components with complex geometries.},

Abstract = {Polymer Additive Manufacturing (PAM) is a type of manufacturing
   technology which builds individual layers to form a three-dimensional
   part with complex geometry. The use of PAM components as a functional
   part is still insignificant when compared to injection molding
   components. This is due to marginal mechanical properties of Polymer
   Additive Manufactured components. The present work is an attempt to
   determine the mechanical properties of a specimen printed by a polymer
   material using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technique. The effect of
   infill percentage and build direction on tensile strength and flexural
   strength of manufactured ASA parts is compared with similar injection
   molded parts in literature. Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate (ASA)
   material is chosen for the present work to do experiments. The part is
   designed in Creo parametric 4.0 and converted to .stl file format. The
   specimen is printed using a STRATASYS F-370 FDM machine. It can be
   concluded that the increase in infill percentage of the ASA material
   resulted in increased tensile strength along the print direction. (C)

Abstract = {Throughout the world there have been alarming concerns over the use of
   nonrenewable resources during manufacturing of goods and associated
   environmental legislations. Therefore, the use of natural materials and
   fabrication of composites therefrom, particularly, development of
   natural fiber reinforced polymer composites is gaining significant
   attention. Although natural fiber reinforced composites (NFRCs) show
   strong application prospects, various materials and processing related
   challenges needs to be addressed to achieve long-term stability and
   performance. In this review, we attempted to provide an overview of
   different types of natural fibers, their characteristics and properties
   enabling them to be used as reinforcing agents in different polymers.
   Then the unique requirement of fiber surface modification to achieve
   enhanced fiber-matrix bonding is discussed. The article also discusses
   conventional processing routes and critical issues associated with NFRCs
   processing. The use of different additive manufacturing (AM)
   technologies in processing polymer composites is also discussed. At the
   end, we have critically analyzed the challenges and opportunities
   associated with AM of NFRCs.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), or 3D printing, has arisen as a booming
   technology for the development of more creative devices and potential
   functional applications in biomedical, electronics, sensors, and tissue
   engineering through the pioneering combination of shape memory polymers
   (SMPs). However, restricted printable materials and poor qualities of
   existing 3D printing materials in terms of mechanical strength, curing
   speed, and thermomechanical shape memory have impeded the adoption of
   SMPs in 3D printing. Several SMPs are available in the market in
   response to these drawbacks. This paper is contributing a review in
   advancement of polyurethanes as SMP polymers in 3D printing. Copyright

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing methods currently use solid fillers in the
   polymer matrix to make composites. Many researchers have studied the
   effect of die design on solid fillers like glass and carbon fibers but
   there is no research on incorporating immiscible liquid additives which
   can lead to additive manufacturing of solid parts with a controllable
   immiscible liquid morphology internal to the part. To accomplish this,
   experiments must be done to determine the effect of die design on the
   deformation induced on an immiscible droplet in the flow field. In this
   research, the feasibility of using shear flows and extensional flows to
   deform a droplet is first studied. A channel with walls based on a
   hyperbolic equation can impose a constant stretch rate at the center and
   makes it easier to model the flow. Applying this principle, a converging
   channel is built, filled with Silicone oil (Matrix liquid) and subject
   to hyperbolic flows. The deformation seen by a droplet of immiscible
   Castor oil is studied for various positions of injection using high
   speed imagery. It was observed that droplets injected at the center of
   the channel did not see any significant stretch but the ones injected
   closer to the walls stretched and reached the affine state. Simulations
   studies were performed using ANSYS Fluent to find the velocity gradients
   along each streamline where the droplet was injected. This data,
   combined with the droplet widths measured from the images, was used to
   track the Capillary number changes for a given droplet. It was observed
   that droplets with a higher initial Capillary number saw a steeper
   reduction than droplets with lower initial Capillary numbers. Further,
   close examination of the droplet dimensions from each image showed that
   the droplet width reduced and reached an asymptote in the channel. These
   results aid in understanding liquid filler behavior in a polymer flow
   and helps in incorporating liquids in polymer based additive
   manufacturing.},

Abstract = {Although multiple-material additive manufacturing has progressed rapidly
   over the last few years, little progress has been made so far on the
   additive manufacturing of metal/polymer hybrid components due to
   significantly different material properties. In this study, we
   investigated the printing of hybrid metal (Cu10Sn) and polymer (PA11)
   objects through a proprietary multiple-material laser powder bed fusion
   (LPBF) system. Powder materials were delivered to the build platform
   through an ultrasonic vibration-assisted dispensing system. Several 2D
   Cu10Sn/PA11 structures were printed and demonstrated. The scientific
   mechanism underlying how the interaction between Cu10Sn and PA11 during
   laser scanning affected printing quality is discussed. In addition, the
   roughness of the printed Cu10Sn top surface was improved tenfold with
   the addition of small amount of PA11 powder. Finally, several 3D
   components consisting of hybrid stainless steel (SS 316 L), copper
   (Cu10Sn), and polymer (PA11) including entangling structures were
   printed and discussed. Potential applications of this technology are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Polymer materials have the capacity to morph into a soft form and flow
   when heated, then return to their original hardness when cooled, making
   them excellent for heat fabrication procedures. Acrylonitrile Butadiene
   Styrene (ABS) is a high-grade polymer with exceptional mechanical
   qualities and heat resistance that is commonly used in aircraft and
   vehicle manufacture. These polymers are mixed with other materials to
   create alloys, which are primarily used in the production and
   fabrication of high-performance engineering thermoplastics. Additive
   layer manufacturing technologies based on polymer composites have been
   widely employed in 3D printing for decades. The effect of numerous
   processing parameters involved in ALM procedures such as FDM of
   polymer-fibre composites for improved physical and mechanical properties
   was highlighted in the assessment of polymer materials. This paper also
   briefly discusses the physical features of FDM-based ALM processes and
   fibre composites. As a result, the research article provides a
   systematic study enabling researchers in the relevant engineering sector
   to evaluate the physical properties of fibre-reinforced polymeric
   composites created using ALM.},

Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING LETTERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {3D hybrid additive manufacturing describes the combined application of
   different additive manufacturing pro-cesses in order to manufacture a
   component with almost unlimited design freedom and free choice of
   materials. One challenge in the hybrid additive manufacturing lies in
   the different conditions of individual additive manu-facturing
   processes. For example, in the combined application of the laser powder
   bed fusion (PBF-LB) of metals with the fused filament fabrication (FFF)
   of polymers, damage can occur in the plastic due to the higher
   process-ing temperatures of PBF-LB. Therefore, in this work a process
   strategy for the buildup of metallic structures in the PBF-LB process on
   polymer base structures was developed. By reducing the laser energy
   density in combination with increasing the height of the first layer, a
   processing window could be identified. The built hybrid compo-nents were
   investigated with micro-computed tomography and the effects of different
   processing parameters on the interface between the polymer and metal
   part are discussed. Finally, a strategy to increase the strength of the
   interface is presented.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has been growing in interest due to its
   non-traditional approach to producing objects by which components are
   fabricated directly from computer models by selectively depositing and
   consolidating or curing raw materials in successive layers. Currently,
   most polymer AM processes are limited by a narrow field of available and
   compatible materials. Typical thermoplastics common to the injection
   molding industry are created from petroleum, a limited and nonrenewable
   resource and have been widely adopted for use in AM. Recently plastics
   that are more sustainable, such as polylactic acid (PLA), have started
   to gain traction as a competitor to these traditional plastics. For this
   study, cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), cellulose acetate propionate
   (CAP), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), nylon 11, and polycaprolactone
   (PCL) were formulated and tested for AM. In addition, ABS and PLA were
   tested as control materials. Results showed the technical feasibility of

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is experiencing widespread adoption in many
   sectors including aerospace and biomedical. Several research works have
   already studied AM to ensure high quality final parts can be
   consistently achieved. To aid in virtually simulating the additive
   manufacturing processes, companies like ANSYS have developed simulation
   packages for their finite element software. These packages have been
   proven to be effective in predicting and minimizing distortion and
   warping, but their capability in predicting resultant mechanical
   characteristics requires further investigation. This paper focuses on
   using ANSYS Additive Suite (AAS) to predict the mechanical performance
   of polymer parts produced by a selective laser sintering process.
   Utilizing AAS, the process of additively manufacturing a tensile test
   specimen was simulated, followed by simulated tensile loading in ANSYS
   Mechanical. The output of this simulation was then experimentally
   verified with physical components. The results show that AAS can
   increase the accuracy of displacement prediction of a part under load
   within the elastic region with minimal experimentation required.
   However, it was also observed that the accuracy starts to decrease when
   approaching the yield point and consequently entering the plastic region
   due to the complexity of plastic behavior. When designing, the yield
   point is a critical design parameter and often considered the limit of a
   material. The process outlined in this paper allows for validation of AM
   design to be done faster, cheaper, and with more flexibility than
   possible using experimental or mathematical methods. Should this process
   be further refined, generative design possibilities will be
   significantly more powerful.},

   the effect of varying the contact load on the friction and wear
   mechanisms of additively manufactured acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
   (3D ABS) and Verogray polymers fabricated using Polyjet technology.
   Loads of 1, 5 and 10 N were applied under dry sliding contact with a
   52100 steel counterface at room temperature. Dependence of friction and
   wear on the surface orientation to the sliding direction is noted. The
   results demonstrate that at 1 N load, the friction coefficient is
   primarily dependent on the orientation of the surface to the sliding
   direction. However, at higher loads of 5 N and 10 N, this dependency is
   shown to be a function of the bulk material properties rather than the
   surface roughness. Further correlation between the surface morphology
   and wear rate is shown to be dependent on the bulk material properties
   and the applied load. The results from this study provide alternate
   application uses for Polyjet materials in metal-polymer tribo-contacts
   for improved friction and wear performance.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies are expanding the boundaries of
   materials science and providing an exciting forum for interdisciplinary
   research. The ability to fabricate arbitrarily complex objects has made
   AM technologies indispensable in personalized healthcare, soft
   electronics, and renewable energy. At the intersection of AM
   technologies and materials chemistry are stimuli-responsive polymers,
   which change their chemical and physical properties in response to
   specific environmental cues. The responsiveness of these ``smart{''}
   polymers makes them suitable for AM and provides functionality to the
   additively manufactured objects. Furthermore, the type and degree of
   stimulus response of smart polymers can be regulated through precise
   synthetic design or via incorporation of additives. Herein, we review
   recently reported stimuli-responsive polymers used in AM, with a focus
   on the design and chemistry of the polymers. The materials are broadly
   classified by type of printing, and more specifically classified by type
   of stimulus response. Finally, we briefly consider existing challenges
   that stimuli-responsive materials in AM can address in the future. (C)

Abstract = {Recent advances in vat photopolymerization (VP) additive manufacturing
   of fully aromatic polyimides employed photoreactive
   high-molecular-weight precursors dissolved at modest loadings (<20 wt
   \%) in organic solvent. These earlier efforts revealed high isotropic
   shrinkage, approaching 52\% on a linear basis while converting to the
   desired polyimide. To increase the polyimide precursor concentration and
   decrease shrinkage during VP processing of high-performance polyimides,
   photoreactive fully aromatic polyimide and thermoplastic polyetherimide
   (PEI) supramolecular salt precursors now serve as versatile
   alternatives. Both pyromellitic dianhydride-4,4'-oxydianiline (PMDA-ODA)
   and 4,4'-(4,4'-isopropylidene-diphenoxy)diphthalic anhydride-meta
   phenylene diamine (BPADA-mPD) supramolecular dicarboxylate-diammonium
   salts, termed polysalts, provided prerequisite rheological performance
   and photoreactivity for VP. Solutions (50 wt \%) of both photoactive
   polysalts exhibited viscosities more than two orders of magnitude lower
   than previously reported polyimide precursor solutions for VP. In
   addition, VP of 50 wt \% polysalt solutions yielded high resolution,
   self-supporting organogel structures. During thermal postprocessing to
   the desired fully aromatic polyimide and PEI, photocrosslinked polysalt
   organogels exhibited retention of part shape in concert with linear
   isotropic shrinkage of only 26\%, the lowest reported value using
   organogel strategies for VP of fully aromatic polyimides. Furthermore,
   the imidized structures exhibited comparable thermal and mechanical
   properties to analogous polyimides synthesized using classical
   methodologies for 2D films. The combination of facile synthesis and
   increased precursor concentrations designates polysalt polyimide
   precursors as a versatile platform for additive manufacturing of
   well-defined 3D polyimide structures.},

Title = {Effect of infill on resulting mechanical properties of additive
   manufactured bioresorbable polymers for medical devices},
Journal = {MATERIALIA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The crossover between additive manufacturing (AM) and bioresorbable
   materials play a critical role in development of new bioresorbable
   medical devices. When combined with the innovation and technological
   advances of additive manufacturing, the use of bioresorbable polymers
   could prove tremendous to the development of custom bioresorbable
   implants. However, a key question for the use of thermoplastic-based
   resorbable polymers lies in the potential changes in properties
   experienced during manufacturing, and thus the effect of process
   parameters on the performance of the final device is of critical
   importance. Specific resorbable materials are selected for mechanical
   and resorption rate properties based on bulk measurements. The implanted
   mechanical properties of a device are significantly affected by
   processing parameters and are the leading concern of clinicians during
   development and patient use of a new device. In this work, additive
   manufacturing of medical grade polymers and copolymers of L-lactide,
   E-caprolactone were extruded into filaments of 1.75 mm in diameter and
   printed at different infill percentages. The molecular, thermal, and
   mechanical properties of homopolymers of L-lactide and E-caprolactone,
   along with a unique copolymer of L-lactide, E-caprolactone, and
   trimethylene carbonate, Lactoflex 7415 were evaluated. Through variance
   of material composition and the infill parameter of AM, an order of
   magnitude range in tensile strength and modulus properties were observed
   as feasible and optimizable.},

   carbon fiber reinforced polymer microlattices},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite is known for its high
   stiffness-to-weight ratio and hence is of great interest in several
   engineering fields such as aerospace, automotive, defense, etc. However,
   such a composite is not suitable for energy dissipation as failure
   occurs with very little or no plastic deformation. Herein, we present an
   extendable multi-material projection microstereolithography process
   capable of producing carbonfiber-reinforced cellular materials that
   achieve simultaneously high specific stiffness and damping coefficient.
   Inspired by the upper bounds of stiffness-loss coefficient in a
   two-phase composite, we designed and additively manufactured CFRP
   microlattices with soft phases architected into selected stiff-phase
   struts. Our results, confirmed by experimental and analytical
   calculations, revealed that the damping performance can be significantly
   enhanced by the addition of only a small fraction of the soft phase. The
   presented design and additive manufacturing strategy allow for
   optimizing mutually exclusive properties. As a result, these CFRP
   microlattices achieved high specific stiffness comparable to commercial
   CFRP, technical ceramics, and composites, while being dissipative like
   elastomers.},

Abstract = {In this work, we report the development of an all-polymer-based
   piezoelectric photocurable resin (V-Ink) suitable for additive

   manufacturability and piezoelectric characteristics, the optimized V-Ink
   contains 35 wt.\% of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) particles being
   suspended in the photocurable resin. We have successfully demonstrated a
   3D printed piezoelectrically-active thick film with an optimized
   piezoelectric voltage coefficient (g(33)) of 105.12 x 10(-3) V.m/N. We
   envision this new materials will bring promising opportunities for
   additive manufacturing of flexible functional devices, especially for
   novel applications in biosensing and detection. (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {This study evaluates the use of a barrel atmospheric plasma system for
   the treatment of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and polylactic acid
   polymer particles. Treatments were carried out in a helium discharge
   with either oxygen or nitrogen addition. The plasma activated polymer
   particles were then used to prepare filaments, which in-turn were then
   used to fabricated parts by additive manufacturing. The resultant dog
   bone polymer parts exhibited up to a 22\% increase in tensile strength,
   compared to parts fabricated using unactivated polymer particles. The
   explanation for the increased mechanical strength is the enhanced
   activation of the treated polymer particles, as well as the removal of
   contaminations from the polymer surface.

Abstract = {Multi-material additive manufacturing (AM) attempts to utilize the full
   benefits of complex part production with a comprehensive and
   complementary material spectrum. In this context, this research article
   presents new processing strategies in the field of polymer- and
   metal-based multi-material AM. The investigation highlights the current
   progress in powder-based multi-material AM based on three successfully
   utilized technological approaches: additive and formative manufacturing
   of hybrid metal parts with locally adapted and tailored properties,
   material-efficient AM of multi-material polymer parts through
   electrophotography, and the implementation of UV-curable thermosets
   within the laser-based powder bed fusion of plastics. Owing to the
   complex requirements for the mechanical testing of multi-material parts
   with an emphasis on the transition area, this research targets an
   experimental shear testing set-up as a universal method for both metal-
   and polymer-based processes. The method was selected based on the common
   need of all technologies for the sufficient characterization of the
   bonding behavior between the individual materials.},

Title = {Development of additive manufacturing technology based on selective
   metal-polymer composite formation},
Journal = {RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Pages = {52-68},
Abstract = {Purpose - During the past years, numerous market segments have
   increasingly adopted additive manufacturing technologies for product
   development and complex parts design. Consequently, recent developments
   have expanded the technologies, materials and applications in support of
   emerging needs, in addition to improving current processes. The present
   work aims to propose and characterise a new technology that is based on
   selective formation of metal-polymer composites with low power source.
   Design/methodology/approach - To develop this project, the authors have
   divided this work in three parts: material development, process
   feasibility and process optimisation. For the polymeric material
   development, investigation of metallic and composite materials assessed
   each material's suitability for selective composite formation besides
   residual material removal. The primary focus was the evaluation of
   proposed process feasibility. The authors applied multivariable methods,
   where the main responses were line width, penetration depth, residual
   material removal feasibility, layer adherence strength, mechanical
   strength and dimensional deviation of resultant object. The laser trace
   speed, distance between formation lines and laser diameter were the main
   variables. Removal agent and polymeric material formulation were
   constants. In the last part of this work, the authors applied a
   multi-objective optimisation. The optimisation objectives minimized
   processing time and dimensional deviation while maximizing mechanical
   strength in xy direction and mechanical strength in z direction.
   Findings - With respect to material development, the polymeric material
   tensile strength was found between 30 and 45 MPa at break. It was also
   seen that this material has low viscosity before polymerized ( between 2
   and 20 cP) essential for composite formation and complete material
   removal. In that way, the authors also identified that the residual
   material removal process was possible by redox reaction. In contrast
   with that the final object was marked by the polymer which covers the
   metallic matrix, protecting the object protects against chemical
   reactions. For the feasibility study, the authors identified the process
   windows for adherence between composite layers, demonstrating the
   process feasibility. The composite mechanical strength was shown to be
   between 120 and 135 MPa in xy direction and between 35 and 45 MPa in z
   direction. In addition, the authors have also evidenced that the
   geometrical dimensional distortion might vary until 5 mm, depending on
   process configuration. Despite that, the authors identified an optimised
   configuration that exposes the potential application of this new
   technology. As this work is still in a preliminary development stage,
   further studies are needed to be done to better understand the process
   and market segments wherein it might be applied.
   Originality/value - This paper proposed a new and innovative additive
   manufacturing technology which is based on metal-polymer composites
   using low power source. Additionally, this work also described studies
   related to the investigation of concept feasibility and proposed process
   characterisation. The authors have focused on material development and
   studied the functional feasibility, which at the same time might be
   useful to the development of other additive manufacturing processes.},

Abstract = {Studies on polymer matrix continuous fiber reinforced composite additive
   manufacturing have shown a significant increase in recent years to
   improve the mechanical properties of parts produced by polymer-based
   additive manufacturing methods. In this study, producibility of polymer
   matrix continuous fiber reinforced composite parts was investigated for
   the composite additive manufacturing method. For this purpose, a system
   that can produce composite fiber using UV light curing epoxy resin as
   matrix material and continuous glass/carbon fiber bundles as
   reinforcement material has been developed. Photocurable epoxy resin in
   liquid form and fiber bundle are fed through a nozzle, the photopolymer
   is cured in the exit of nozzle with a coaxial UV light source that
   mounted on the head. As a result of the experiments, it has been
   observed that the matrix material completely encompasses the
   reinforcement material bundle, the curing process of the matrix material
   with the UV light source is provided and thus, composite fiber
   production can be carried out in the direction of the nozzle axis.
   Because of the opacity, carbon fibers block UV light, so the
   photopolymer resin at the inner section of the fiber bundle cannot be
   cured, so carbon fiber reinforced composite fiber production has failed.
   However, this shading problem was not observed with glass fiber
   reinforced samples. Thus, it has been demonstrated that glass fiber
   reinforcement material is more suitable than carbon fiber material in
   terms of producing polymer matrix continuous fiber reinforced composite
   parts by additive manufacturing method.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing technologies have transitioned from the
   fabrication of prototypes to final product manufacturing with
   competitive mechanical performance. The use of materials with high
   strength to weight ratio, and more specifically continuous
   fibre-reinforced composites, has demonstrated potential when fabricated
   through fused filament fabrication (FFF). The development and evaluation
   of such technologies has attracted a lot of attention in recent years,
   from both academic researchers and from industry, and a plethora of
   different techniques for its achievement has been proposed. This review
   presents different methods of FFF for the fabrication of continuous
   fibre-reinforced composite components as described in both patent and
   scholarly research literature. Different print head designs and
   techniques for combining and depositing polymers reinforced with
   continuous fibre have been developed including pre-impregnation, the use
   of multiple nozzles for the separate deposition of the fibre and the
   matrix material, and in situ impregnation of the reinforcing fibre with
   the matrix material. This review identifies the challenges associated
   with each of these approaches such as achieving a successful
   fibre/matrix impregnation, cutting of the continuous fibres during
   processing, and the introduction of high-performance thermoplastic
   polymers as the matrix material.},

Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {27},
Pages = {80-90},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Here we introduce a versatile stereolithographic route to produce three
   different kinds of Si-containing thermosets that yield high performance
   ceramics upon thermal treatment. Our approach is based on a fast and
   inexpensive thiol-ene free radical addition that can be applied for
   different classes of preceramic polymers with carbon-carbon double
   bonds. Due to the rapidity and efficiency of the thiol-ene click
   reactions, this additive manufacturing process can be effectively
   carried out using conventional light sources on benchtop printers.
   Through light initiated cross-linking, the liquid preceramic polymers
   transform into stable infusible thermosets that preserve their shape
   during the polymer-to-ceramic transformation. Through pyrolysis the
   thermosets transform into glassy ceramics with uniform shrinkage and
   high density. The obtained ceramic structures are nearly fully dense,
   have smooth surfaces, and are free from macroscopic voids and defects. A
   fabricated SiOC honeycomb was shown to exhibit a significantly higher
   compressive strength to weight ratio in comparison to other porous
   ceramics.},

   Due to the anisotropic character of additive manufactured parts the
   slicing, filling strategies and building direction as well as the
   processing parameters like extruder temperature, printing speed, layer
   width and thickness strongly determine the final conductivity of the
   printed path. To measure the resistance of the composite a DC power
   supply and a digital multimeter was used. The structure of the specimens
   was examined by computer tomography. An electric torch as demonstrator
   was realized successfully.},

Abstract = {The way additive layer manufacturing works is that materials are added
   in layers to create components. Every layer represents a narrow cross
   section of the component generated from the CAD data file. Each layer in
   ALM must have a defined part thickness, and the final part will be an
   estimate of the actual data. The last element will be the thinner
   surface of each layer that is formed. Modern and sophisticated ALM
   machines operate on a layer-based philosophy and methodology, which
   differs from traditional processes in terms of the materials utilised in
   component manufacture, the final layers formed, and how the layers are
   bonded to one another. These margins will look at things like the end
   part's correctness, as well as its material and mechanical qualities. We
   will determine several criteria in this study, such as how quickly the
   part can be manufactured utilising various ALM procedures. We also
   explore the beginnings of addi-tive layer manufacturing and introduce
   the basic notion of additive layer manufacturing in this work. It will
   also go over the design process for additive layer manufacturing as well
   as the whole production of polymer composite based components tools. For
   functional engineering environments, polymer material is commonly
   employed to create hard and robust plastic parts. This material is
   extremely long-lasting, and it can be made or even welded if necessary.
   A minor change in the characteristics of the same mate-rial can make a
   big difference. ALM can be helpful at this point since it allows the
   designer to create a tangible model of the product to show its use and
   functions.Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Selection

Title = {Additive manufacturing of heat-sensitive polymer melt using a pellet-fed
   material extrusion},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {552-559},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The most common method for Additive Manufacturing (AM) of polymers is
   melt extrusion, which normally requires several pre-processing steps to
   compound and extrude filament feedstock, resulting in an overall long
   melt residency time. Consequently a typical melt extrusion-based AM
   process is time/cost consuming, and limited in the availability of
   materials that can be processed. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) is one of the
   heat sensitive polymers demonstrating a thermal decomposition
   temperature overlapping its processing window. This study proposed to
   use a pellet-fed material extrusion technique to directly process PVOH
   granules without the necessity of using any pre-processing steps. The
   approach essentially combined compounding, extrusion and AM, allowing
   multi-material printing with minimum exposure to heat during the
   process. The processing parameters were determined via thermal and
   rheological characterisation of PVOH. Effects of processing temperature
   and time on the thermal decomposition of PVOH were demonstrated, which
   further affected the tensile properties and solubility. An increase in
   Young's modulus, stress at 2\% strain, and Ultimate Tensile Stress were
   98 +/- 4\%, 40 +/- 5\%, and 20 +/- 2\%, respectively, was observed when
   PVOH residency time was reduced from 25 min to 14 min. The pellet-fed
   material extrusion technology demonstrated good 3D printability,
   multi-material printing capability, and great versatility in processing
   polymer melts.},

Title = {Measurement and modeling of filament temperature distribution in the
   standoff gap between nozzle and bed in polymer-based additive
   manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {224-231},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Dispensing of a polymer filament above its glass transition temperature
   is a critical step in several polymer-based additive manufacturing
   techniques. While the nozzle assembly heats up the filament prior to
   dispense, it is important to minimize cooling down of the filament in
   the standoff distance between the nozzle tip and bed. While heat
   transfer processes within the nozzle assembly, such as filament melting,
   and on the bed, such as thermally-driven filament-to-filament adhesion,
   have been well studied, there is a lack of work on heat transfer in the
   filament in the standoff region. This paper presents infrared
   thermography based measurement of temperature distribution in the
   filament in the standoff region, and an analytical model for heat
   transfer in this region. The analytical model, based on a balance
   between thermal advection and convective/radiative heat loss predicts an
   exponentially decaying temperature distribution, the nature of which is
   governed by the characteristic length, a parameter that combines
   multiple process parameters such as mass flowrate, filament diameter,
   heat capacity and cooling conditions. Experimental data in a wide range
   of process parameters are found to be in very good agreement with the
   analytical model. The thermal design space for ensuring minimal
   temperature drop in the standoff region is explored based on the
   analytical model. Experimental data and theoretical modeling presented
   here improve our fundamental understanding of heat transfer in polymer
   additive manufacturing, and may contribute towards design tools for
   thermal optimization of these processes.},

   Quality Control for Polymer Jetting},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Polymer-based additive manufacturing (AM) gathers a great deal of
   interest with regard to standardization and implementation in mass
   production. A new methodology for the system and process capabilities
   analysis in additive manufacturing, using statistical quality tools for
   production management, is proposed. A large sample of small specimens of
   circular shape was manufactured of photopolymer resins using polymer
   jetting (PolyJet) technology. Two critical geometrical features of the
   specimen were investigated. The variability of the measurement system
   was determined by Gage repeatability and reproducibility (Gage R\&R)
   methodology. Machine and process capabilities were performed in relation
   to the defined tolerance limits and the results were analyzed based on
   the requirements from the statistical process control. The results
   showed that the EDEN 350 system capability and PolyJet process
   capability enables obtaining capability indices over 1.67 within the
   capable tolerance interval of 0.22 mm. Furthermore, PolyJet technology
   depositing thin layers of resins droplets of 0.016 mm allows for
   manufacturing in a short time of a high volume of parts for mass
   production with a tolerance matching the ISO 286 IT9 grade for radial
   dimension and IT10 grade for linear dimensions on the Z-axis,
   respectively. Using microscopy analysis some results were explained and
   validated from the capability study.},

Abstract = {Triboluminescence (TL) is a phenomenon of light emission induced by
   impact, stress, fracture, or an applied mechanical force. This
   phenomenon can be used to detect, evaluate, and predict mechanical
   failures in composites. In this report, we utilized manganese-doped
   zinc-sulphide (ZnS: Mn) and Polystyrene (PS) composite to fabricate a TL
   functional part via additive manufacturing. The morphology of the
   particles inside the polymer matrix were studied using scanning electron
   microscopy and micro CT scan. Thermoanalytical techniques such as
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis
   (TGA) were carried out to evaluate the thermal transitions and
   degradation of the composites. The mechanoluminescence performance of
   the printed samples is evaluated by three-point flexural test and
   observed to depend on processing conditions that can be utilized to
   achieve a strong light signal at different mechanical loads. The polymer
   composite fabrication and processing reduced particle size, enhanced
   particle dispersion, and altered the mechanical properties of the
   polymer to help increase the mechanoluminescence response up to 10 times
   in the 3D printed parts. The unique mechanoluminescence properties of 3D
   printed luminescent composite have great potential for structural

Title = {Interlaminar strengthening of multidirectional laminates using polymer
   additive manufacturing},
Journal = {MATERIALS \& DESIGN},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {133},
Pages = {332-339},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {A novel approach for improving the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS)
   properties of multi-directional prepreg laminates using polymer additive
   manufacturing (PAM) technology is proposed in this paper. Fused
   deposition modeling (FDM) is the PAM technology used for imparting
   patterns onto carbon prepregs. These modified prepregs are further used
   for fabricating multi-directional laminates. Prior to manufacturing the
   laminates, interlaminar regions that are most susceptible to
   delamination type failure are identified using numerical simulations for
   selectively reinforcing these critical regions. Next, the influence of
   printed reinforcements on the ILSS of modified laminates is compared
   against pristine laminates by conducting short beam shear (SBS) tests.
   Significant improvement in the ILSS values of up to 28\% is observed,
   which can be attributed to the resistance offered by the printed
   reinforcements that steered the delamination surfaces along undulated
   paths as opposed to smooth or straight paths in pristine laminates. Such
   behavior corroborates the resistance to delamination offered by these
   printed reinforcements. In summary, this is a pioneering study for
   exploring the feasibility of using PAM technology for imparting
   reinforcements at the interlaminar regions in multi-directional
   laminates with the intention of minimizing delamination. (C) 2017

Title = {Large-scale additive manufacturing tooling for extrusion-compression
   molds},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {1},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites (CFPC) have been used in
   additive manufacturing (AM) due to both the high-strength-to-weight and
   superior-stiffness-to-weight ratios. CF AM is being considered for
   tooling applications. In AM, CFPCs are usually aligned along the
   deposition direction; however, it results in anisotropic thermal
   properties which affect the heat transfer and warpage of the final part.
   In this study, three male molds with different infill patterns were
   produced via the material extrusion additive manufacturing (EDF-AM)
   process. These include (a) 0 degrees: infill pattern along the printing
   direction; (b) 90 degrees: infill pattern perpendicular to the printing
   direction; and (c) 0 degrees/90 degrees: alternate layers along and
   perpendicular directions. The effect of the infill pattern on thermal
   conductivity was analyzed and observed that 0 degrees infill (surface
   temperature: 79.2 degrees C) had the highest conductivity; and 90
   degrees infill (surface temperature: 66.4 degrees C) had the least.
   Highlights (for Review): In Additive manufacturing, carbon fibers are
   usually aligned along the deposition direction; however, it results in
   anisotropic thermal properties which affect the heat transfer and
   warpage of the final part. In this study, three molds with different
   infill patterns were produced via the extrusion deposition
   fabrication-additive manufacturing (EDF-AM) process. These include (a) 0

Title = {Ultrasonic additive manufacturing using feedstock with build-in
   circuitry for 3D metal embedded electronics},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Embedded electronics and sensors are becoming increasingly important for
   the development of Industry 4.0. For small components, space constraints
   lead to full 3D integration requirements that are only achievable
   through Additive Manufacturing. Manufacturing metal components usually
   require high temperatures incompatible with electronics but Ultrasonic
   Additive Manufacturing (UAM) can produce components with mechanical
   properties close to bulk, but with the integration of internal embedded
   electronics, sensors or optics. This paper describes a novel
   manufacturing route for embedding electronics with 3D via connectors in
   an aluminium matrix. Metal foils with printed conductors and insulators
   were prepared separately from the UAM process thereby separating the
   electronics preparation from the part consolidation. A dual material
   polymer layer exhibited the best electrically insulating properties,
   while providing mechanical protection of printed conducive tracks stable
   up to 100 degrees C. General design and UAM process recommendations are
   given for 3D embedded electronics in a metal matrix.},

Volume = {7},

Pages = {711-723},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The field of self-healing soft robots was initiated a few years ago. A
   healing ability can be integrated in soft robots by manufacturing their
   soft membranes out of synthetic self-healing polymers, more specifically
   elastomeric Diels-Alder (DA) networks. As such they can recover
   completely from macroscopic damage, including scratches, cuts, and
   ruptures. Before this research, these robots were manufactured using a
   technique named ``shaping-through-folding-and-self-healing.{''} This
   technique requires extensive manual labor, is relatively slow, and does
   not allow for complex shapes. In this article, an additive manufacturing
   methodology, fused filament fabrication, is developed for the
   thermoreversible DA polymers, and the approach is validated on a soft
   robotic gripper. The reversibility of their network permits
   manufacturing these flexible self-healing polymers through reactive
   printing into the complex shapes required in soft robotics. The degree
   of freedom in the design of soft robotics that this new manufacturing
   technique offers is illustrated through the construction of adaptive
   DHAS gripper fingers, based on the design by FESTO. Being constructed
   out of self-healing soft flexible polymer, the fingers can recover
   entirely from large cuts, tears, and punctures. This is highlighted
   through various damage-heal cycles.},

Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Since this advent, additive manufacturing (AM) has grown steadily and
   found applications across all types of sectors. While the great
   development of such technologies has improved the quality of prints and
   expanded the availability of materials, AM still has some limitations
   regarding its physical scaling. This paper will briefly present the
   state-of-the-art of large-scale additive manufacturing and subsequently
   greater attention will be given to extrusion-based 3D printing.
   Specifically, we will discuss about large format additive manufacturing
   (LFAM) or big area additive manufacturing (BAAM), a technology based on
   material extrusion born a few years ago. These systems are characterized
   by higher deposition rate and lower costs of the material compared to
   fused filament fabrication (FFF) printers; moreover, they allow to
   obtain parts with better properties (e.g., adding carbon or glass
   fibers). The world of research has shown great interest in large-scale
   material extrusion technologies, which appear to be quite competitive
   with conventional manufacturing processes and which will find increasing
   application in the industrial field. With the aim of developing a tool
   for orienting researchers and technicians in this complex field, the
   present paper presents a systematic review of the actual market of
   machines, the research in extrudable materials and related applications
   concerning large-scale 3D printing, and in particular the LFAM.},

Title = {Directed Assembly of Particles for Additive Manufacturing of
   Particle-Polymer Composites},
Journal = {MICROMACHINES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Particle-polymer dispersions are ubiquitous in additive manufacturing
   (AM), where they are used as inks to create composite materials with
   applications to wearable sensors, energy storage materials, and
   actuation elements. It has been observed that directional alignment of
   the particle phase in the polymer dispersion can imbue the resulting
   composite material with enhanced mechanical, electrical, thermal or
   optical properties. Thus, external field-driven particle alignment
   during the AM process is one approach to tailoring the properties of
   composites for end-use applications. This review article provides an
   overview of externally directed field mechanisms (e.g., electric,
   magnetic, and acoustic) that are used for particle alignment.
   Illustrative examples from the AM literature show how these mechanisms
   are used to create structured composites with unique properties that can
   only be achieved through alignment. This article closes with a
   discussion of how particle distribution (i.e., microstructure) affects
   mechanical properties. A fundamental description of particle phase
   transport in polymers could lead to the development of AM process
   control for particle-polymer composite fabrication. This would
   ultimately create opportunities to explore the fundamental impact that
   alignment has on particle-polymer composite properties, which opens up
   the possibility of tailoring these materials for specific applications.},

Volume = {68},
Number = {A},
Pages = {1378-1386},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing of plastics as modern technology introduces new
   perspectives towards exceptional structures and allows realization of
   contemporary designs. For those purposes a post-treatment of the
   compo-nents, e.g. surface coating with metals, is crucial.
   Electroplating on polymers, like ABS (terpolymer of acrylo-nitrile,
   butadiene and styrene), is an established industrial process applied on
   components manufactured by standard technologies, like injection
   molding. It consists of various steps - from cleaning over creating
   electric conductivity on the non-conducting polymer surface towards
   galvanic coating with metals. In this publication, the challenges in
   transferring this process to additive manufactured ABS components are
   analyzed by focusing on the surface quality. Surface quality is
   evaluated by macroscopic imaging and different microscopic technologies
   (transmission light microscopy, laser scanning microscopy and scanning
   electron microscopy). The success of electroplating processes on
   plastics strongly depends on the nature of the plastic surfaces and
   therefore on the additive manufacturing parameters applied. The used
   additive technology of fused deposition modelling is characterized by
   the deposition of single plastic strands. Adjustments of selected
   manufacturing parameters, such as the layer thickness and the overlap of
   the stored plastic strands, create the conditions of homogenous and well
   adhering metal coatings. According to the surface topology from this
   additive manufacturing process, pre-treatment with levelling and sealing
   the surface is identified as important challenge towards success and
   reproducibility of electroplating process.},

   Additive Manufacturing for Polymers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES SCIENCE},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The demand for additively manufactured polymer composites with increased
   specific properties and functional microstructure has drastically
   increased over the past decade. The ability to manufacture complex
   designs that can maximize strength while reducing weight in an automated
   fashion has made 3D-printed composites a popular research target in the
   field of engineering. However, a significant amount of understanding and
   basic research is still necessary to decode the fundamental process
   mechanisms of combining enhanced functionality and additively
   manufactured composites. In this review, external field-assisted
   additive manufacturing techniques for polymer composites are discussed
   with respect to (1) self-assembly into complex microstructures, (2)
   control of fiber orientation for improved interlayer mechanical
   properties, and (3) incorporation of multi-functionalities such as
   electrical conductivity, self-healing, sensing, and other functional
   capabilities. A comparison between reinforcement shapes and the type of
   external field used to achieve mechanical property improvements in
   printed composites is addressed. Research has shown the use of such
   materials in the production of parts exhibiting high strength-to-weight
   ratio for use in aerospace and automotive fields, sensors for monitoring
   stress and conducting electricity, and the production of flexible
   batteries.},

Abstract = {Stimuli-responsive polymers (SRPs) are special types of soft materials,
   which have been extensively used for developing flexible actuators, soft
   robots, wearable devices, sensors, self-expanding structures, and
   biomedical devices, thanks to their ability to change their shapes and
   functional properties in response to external stimuli including light,
   humidity, heat, pH, electric field, solvent, and magnetic field or
   combinations of two or more of these stimuli. In recent years, additive
   manufacturing (AM) aka 3D printing technology of these SRPs, also known
   as 4D printing, has gained phenomenal attention in different engineering
   fields, thanks to its unique ability to develop complex, personalized,
   and innovative structures, which undergo twisting, elongating, swelling,
   rolling, shrinking, bending, spiraling, and other complex morphological
   transformations. Herein, an effort has been made to provide insightful
   information about the AM techniques, type of SRPs, and their
   applications including, but not limited to tissue engineering, soft
   robots, bionics, actuators, sensors, construction, and smart textiles.
   This article also incorporates the current challenges and prospects,
   hoping to provide an insightful basis for the utilization of this
   technology in different engineering fields. It is expected that the
   amalgamation of 3D printing with SRPs would provide unparalleled
   advantages in different engineering arenas.

Title = {Numerical Simulation of a Core-Shell Polymer Strand in Material
   Extrusion Additive Manufacturing},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Material extrusion additive manufacturing (ME-AM) techniques have been
   recently introduced for core-shell polymer manufacturing. Using ME-AM
   for core-shell manufacturing offers improved mechanical properties and
   dimensional accuracy over conventional 3D-printed polymer. Operating
   parameters play an important role in forming the overall quality of the
   3D-printed manufactured products. Here we use numerical simulations
   within the framework of computation fluid dynamics (CFD) to identify the
   best combination of operating parameters for the 3D printing of a
   core-shell polymer strand. The objectives of these CFD simulations are
   to find strands with an ultimate volume fraction of core polymer. At the
   same time, complete encapsulations are obtained for the core polymer
   inside the shell one. In this model, the deposition flow is controlled
   by three dimensionless parameters: (i) the diameter ratio of core
   material to the nozzle, d/D; (ii) the normalised gap between the
   extruder and the build plate, t/D; (iii) the velocity ratio of the
   moving build plate to the average velocity inside the nozzle, V/U.
   Numerical results of the deposited strands' cross-sections demonstrate
   the effects of controlling parameters on the encapsulation of the core
   material inside the shell and the shape and size of the strand. Overall
   we find that the best operating parameters are a diameter ratio of
   d/D=0.7, a normalised gap of t/D=1, and a velocity ratio of V/U=1.},

Pages = {29899-29911},
Abstract = {In this paper, a methodology for selecting a combination of polymers and
   their associated additive manufacturing (AM) routes is presented. The
   binomial consisting of materials performance for the intended
   application and the most suitable AM process and its production strategy
   is solved by the application of a multicriteria approach along with a
   stringency level methodology. The case study has been the analysis of
   physical and radiation tolerance features of thermoplastic nature
   candidates for the additive manufacture of mechanical,
   electromechanical, and electrical components for harsh environments in a
   nuclear power plant. The obtained results allow select an AM route along
   with a production strategy based on large batches or small batches.
   Using a selective laser sintering additive manufacturing route, PP +
   EPDM can be a good option to manufacture mechanical heavily stressed
   components, whereas PA can be a versatile material to manufacture
   friction components or films and sheets for electrical applications. In
   addition, PE would be a good option for high voltage insulation.
   Finally, PS would be used in radio frequency and microwave applications.
   On the other hand, fused deposition modeling techniques are more
   suitable for several materials, such as PC for mechanical applications,
   PE for electromechanical applications, and IR for electrical/electronic
   applications.},

Title = {Design and manufacture of an additive manufacturing printer based on 3D
   melt electrospinning writing of polymer},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLYMER PROCESSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Pages = {424-433},

Abstract = {Objectives: Electrospinning is one of the most well-known approaches to
   producing polymer nanofibers from a polymer solution by applying a
   potential difference (voltage) between the spinner and the collector,
   which is used in various industries such as medicine and military. This
   method has some significant restrictions, like low process efficiency
   due to the evaporation of the solvent, remaining solvent on the fibers,
   which are sometimes toxic, and inability to control the geometry of the
   produced fibers. On the other hand, preparing some solvents used in the
   electrospinning of polymer solutions is costly. Polymer melt
   electrospinning writing is a replacement for this type of
   electrospinning, which can be mentioned in terms of economy, efficiency,
   and production of solvent-free fibers. Therefore, in this research, a
   melt polymer electrospinning device was designed and manufactured
   according to existing extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM)
   devices (3D printer).
   Methods: Changes in an extrusion-based 3D printer to convert it into a
   writing electrospinning device experimentally.
   Results: PLA and PCL fibers with diameters ranging from 8 to 84 mu m
   were produced. The effect of process variables on the produced fibers'
   diameter was investigated: Applied potential difference between the
   nozzle and the substrate: As its increases, the fiber diameter
   decreases. Increasing temperature: As its increases, the fiber diameter
   decreases. Distance between the nozzle and the substrate: As its
   increases, the fiber diameter increases. Flow rate: As its increases,
   the fiber diameter increases.
   Conclusions: By presenting a 3D printer-electrospinning device, it is
   possible to control the fiber's diameter and the 3D geometry in the 3D
   printing-electrospinning process.},

Abstract = {One of the most popular additive manufacturing (AM) processes is based
   on polymer extrusion using a continuous filament as feedstock. However,
   the use of this type of feedstock increases costs and narrows the
   variety of materials that can be used. The development of technologies
   that allow polymer pellets to be processed as feedstock would increase
   the popularity of polymer extrusion by addressing these two issues. This
   work describes the development of a piston-driven extrusion head that
   can extrude polypropylene granules into a filament. The head was
   designed to minimize the volume of material fused during the extrusion
   process and reduce the effect of material degradation. Experiments were
   conducted to characterize the dimensions of the filaments generated.
   Material degradation inside the extrusion head was assessed by infrared
   spectroscopy, and its effect on filament strength was analyzed by
   tensile tests. The results showed that the system was able to produce a
   continuous filament. Spectroscopy revealed that degradation occurs
   inside the heated cylinder but does not greatly influence the strength
   of the extrudate. However, a flow variation along the length of the
   filament was observed. For the proposed system to be considered feasible
   for AM, this variation needs to be better understood and controlled.},

Title = {Electric poling-assisted additive manufacturing process for PVDF
   polymer-based piezoelectric device applications},
Journal = {SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {23},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper presents a new additive manufacturing (AM) process to
   directly and continuously print piezoelectric devices from
   polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymeric filament rods under a strong
   electric field. This process, called `electric poling-assisted additive
   manufacturing or EPAM, combines AM and electric poling processes and is
   able to fabricate free-form shape piezoelectric devices continuously. In
   this process, the PVDF polymer dipoles remain well-aligned and uniform
   over a large area in a single design, production and fabrication step.
   During EPAM process, molten PVDF polymer is simultaneously mechanically
   stresses in-situ by the leading nozzle and electrically poled by
   applying high electric field under high temperature. The EPAM system was
   constructed to directly print piezoelectric structures from PVDF
   polymeric filament while applying high electric field between nozzle tip
   and printing bed in AM machine. Piezoelectric devices were successfully
   fabricated using the EPAM process. The crystalline phase transitions
   that occurred from the process were identified by using the Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscope. The results indicate that devices
   printed under a strong electric field become piezoelectric during the
   EPAM process and that stronger electric fields result in greater
   piezoelectricity as marked by the electrical response and the formation
   of sharper peaks at the polar beta crystalline wavenumber of the PVDF
   polymer. Performing this process in the absence of an electric field
   does not result in dipole alignment of PVDF polymer. The EPAM process is
   expected to lead to the widespread use of AM to fabricate a variety of
   piezoelectric PVDF polymer-based devices for sensing, actuation and
   energy harvesting applications with simple, low cost, single processing
   and fabrication step.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing is used in several industrial sectors where
   polymers and metals are established materials. Different academic
   studies prove that additive manufacturing methods can be applied on
   glass materials using powder or fiber based material sources. In terms
   of quartz glass, with melting temperatures around 2200 degrees C, laser
   sources are used to achieve the necessary intensities. In the present
   study, additive manufacturing of quartz glass is achieved by melting a
   quartz glass fiber with a CO2 laser source. A combined laser head
   focusses the laser radiation onto the glass fiber in order to melt the
   fiber. A three axis system is used to move the printing stage and glass
   substrate. The experimental investigations show that CO2-laser glass
   deposition printing allows for the creation of arbitrary 3D quartz glass
   structures. This method is envisioned to replace conventional manual
   glass manufacturing processes for production of complex hollow glass
   structures which are present in the medical sector. (C) 2018 The

Abstract = {In recent years, increasing interest in 3D Printing (3DP) has meant that
   printer usage is not limited to industrial purposes only, but is also
   for domestic usage by hobbyists for their individual needs.
   Polymer-based part production can now even be conducted outside the
   traditional factory environment. However, low grade printers pose some
   drawbacks, such as lower heat for material fusion, uncontrolled open
   ambience and limited nozzle size. These reduce the mechanical and
   aesthetical qualities as compared to parts fabricated using industrial
   grade printers. The study aims to perform some quality comparisons
   between 3D printed polymeric parts fabricated by both industrial and low
   cost printers, and subsequently to prove the hypothesis that the
   industrial grade printed part has a more reliable surface quality and
   mechanical properties. Specimens were fabricated using each printer type
   (Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) represents the low cost printer and
   the Multi Jet Printer (MJP) is used for the industrial grade) and later
   tested for hardness and surface roughness. Comparisons were then made
   between different fabricating methods and also based on a literature
   study according to the type of materials. The experiments showed that
   both the surface roughness and hardness for the plastic parts fabricated
   by the industrial grade printer were better than those made by the
   domestic printer, and showed a good agreement with the results in the
   literature study. Therefore, for highly durable parts, it is suggested
   that industrial grade printers are used. One point to conclude the
   study, Rapid Prototyping is possible by any machine, but for Rapid
   Manufacturing that requires higher durability, it is better to use an
   industrial grade printer.},

Abstract = {Continuous fiber-reinforced polymer composites have found a wide range
   of applications in the automotive and aerospace industry due to their
   lightweight properties. Recently the use of additive manufacturing (AM)
   has been developed for the fabrication of these composites. This study
   investigates the use of both atmospheric and, for the first time,
   low-pressure (1 Pa) processing conditions for the AM of continuous
   carbon, glass, and Kevlar fiber-reinforced nylon composites.
   Differential scanning calorimetry was used to compare the thermal
   properties of the three types of fiber-reinforced filament prior to
   printing. It was found that the melting peak was dependent on filament
   type, which can be related to the polymer processing conditions used
   during their fabrication. Based on computed tomography measurements, it
   was found that the use of low-pressure printing conditions yielded a
   reduction in porosity for the carbon, glass, and Kevlar printed
   composites of 5.7\%, 1.0\%, and 1.7\%, respectively. The mechanical
   properties of the composites were compared, using a short beam shear
   test, which assisted in the measurement of interlaminar properties. An
   increase in interlaminar shear strength of 33\%, 22\%, and 12\% was
   obtained for the carbon, glass, and Kevlar fiber-reinforced polymer
   composites, respectively, when printed under low pressure, compared with
   that obtained at atmospheric pressure.},

Abstract = {Cast iron and steel weldments are the most common machine tool base
   elements. However, both construction methods have associated
   disadvantages for domestic machine tool manufacturers. This paper
   documents the investigation of an alternative method for machine tool
   base production using concrete to fill an additively manufactured
   polymer mold, where the motion components are attached to the concrete
   base after the initial concrete curing. Modal testing results for a
   three-axis, vertical spindle prototype indicate high damping and
   stiffness can be achieved using the concrete base construction.
   Advantages are reduced cost and lead time compared to traditional

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a transformative manufacturing approach
   capable of building parts with freeform and complex geometries. Polymers
   come with a wide range of material properties and can be processed via
   several different AM processes. Adding anisotropy to polymeric
   composites opens new applications for polymer AM by earning additional
   functionality and creating composites with tailored properties. One of
   the new approaches in creating tailored anisotropic composites is
   pairing external fields that can exert force on fillers and manipulate
   them inside polymeric matrices. Four main types of external fields -
   shear, acoustic, magnetic, and electrical - are devised to control
   filler orientation and concentration in polymeric composites. This
   review highlights the recent research advances in field-assisted
   additive manufacturing technologies with the goal of creating polymeric
   composites with controlled anisotropy orientation and concentration.},

Abstract = {Carbon fiber filled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (CF-ABS) is an
   emerging 3-D printable, recyclable thermo-plastic composite. A popular
   application for CF-ABS is printed molds using large scale additive
   manufacturing (AM) processes produced for a variety of composites
   end-users. Other applications have not been fully realized as CF-ABS
   currently has a higher cost than other polymer composite feedstocks. The
   cost of CF-ABS could be greatly reduced if recycled CF-ABS material was
   accepted and utilized industrially, which would further expand its
   application space. The impacts of mechanical recycling on the properties
   and performance of CF-ABS after AM or other processes are not yet fully
   understood. As such, most AM CF-ABS is discarded as waste after use. In
   this work, AM CF-ABS molds used for concrete castings were recycled
   using an industrial shredder/granulator sys-tem. The granulate was then
   used as feedstock for large area AM to print test specimens. The elastic
   moduli in the printing direction and transverse to printing direction
   after mechanical recycling were found to decrease by 25\% and 10\%,
   respectively, most likely caused by reductions in the fiber content and
   polymer molecular weight. It was found that a significant portion of
   carbon fiber is lost during mechanical recycling through dust
   generation, while the thermomechanical extrusion during printing caused
   the polymer degradation. Although the me-chanical performance of CF-ABS
   was reduced after recycling, the recycled feedstock retained properties
   for reuse as printed molds using large area AM or another suitable
   application.},

Title = {Experimental and theoretical investigation of heat transfer in platform
   bed during polymer extrusion based additive manufacturing},
Journal = {POLYMER TESTING},

Abstract = {Heat transfer plays a key role in polymer extrusion based additive
   manufacturing (AM) processes. Measurement and modeling of how
   temperature distribution on the platform bed changes with time during
   the dispensing of a polymer filament is of particular interest, as it
   determines the effectiveness of merging with neighboring filaments, and
   therefore, the properties of the built part. This paper reports infrared
   thermography based measurement of temperature field on the platform bed
   as a function of time during filament dispense and comparison with an
   analytical model based on moving heat source theory. Measurements
   identify two key heat transfer processes that influence temperature
   distribution on the bed. Data show that diffusion of thermal energy
   deposited on the bed with the filament and heat transfer from the hot
   nozzle tip both influence the temperature distribution on the bed. The
   relative contributions of these two sources of temperature rise on the
   bed are measured for different values of key process parameters.
   Measurement of temperature rise due to diffusion of thermal energy
   deposited on the bed is found to be in excellent agreement with an
   analytical model based on moving heat source theory. Evolution of the
   temperature field after completion of rastering of a line is measured.
   These data play a critical role in determining how effectively a
   filament merges with neighboring filaments. By identifying the key heat
   transfer processes that determine the temperature field on the platform
   bed, this work contributes towards thermal optimization of polymer-based
   additive manufacturing.},

Title = {Photopolymerisable liquid crystals for additive manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {55},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Liquid crystals are often regard as a fourth state phase of matter
   alongside solids, liquids and gases. It has been estimated that one out
   of every ten new synthetic compounds is a liquid crystal, mainly due to
   the fact that liquid crystals have been used in Liquid Crystalline
   Displays (LCDs) for over 50 years. Liquid crystals, often referred to as
   mesogens, exhibit an unique range of ordered mesophases with anisotropic
   physical properties, such as optical, magnetic and dielectric
   anisotropy, for example. These highly anisotropic properties and the
   ability of liquid crystals to self-organize on surfaces, has led to them
   being, are used in a wide range of non-LCD applications. These
   applications include photochromics, pressure sensitive paints, optical
   retarders and optical compensation films, etc. Highly crosslinked,
   anisotropic polymer networks, derived from photopolymerisable liquid
   crystals, so-called reactive mesogens (RMs), have enabled
   solution-fabricated organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic
   field-effect transistors (OFETs) and organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs)
   for plastic electronics. This review will be focus on the relatively
   recent application of liquid crystals, i.e., the 3D/4D printing of
   reactive mesogens and subsequent polymerization to form anisotropic
   polymer networks in advanced additive manufacturing applications. It
   will highlight the challenges of the synthesis and use of new liquid
   crystalline materials in 3D/4D printing for additive manufacturing
   applications. It will show how the study of the successful development
   of design strategies for the synthesis of novel liquid crystals for flat
   panel displays is inspiring the development of novel photopolymerisable
   liquid crystals for additive manufacturing. It is intended that this
   review will serve to inspire chemists, with little or no knowledge of
   liquid crystals, or liquid crystal chemists, to design and synthesize
   new liquid crystals for 3D/4D printing.},

Title = {Reactive extrusion additive manufacturing (REAM) of functionally graded,
   magneto-active thermoset composites},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},
Month = {APR 5},
Abstract = {Reactive extrusion additive manufacturing (REAM) is a process in which a
   motion-controlled nozzle mixes and immediately deposits a multi-part
   thermoset resin to create layered parts that cure rapidly in the ambient
   environment. By mixing particle-filled and neat resins on demand, it is
   possible to functionally grade both the material structure and the
   resulting properties of the parts. This research investigates a two-part
   shape memory polymer in which an epoxy resin is combined with a curing
   agent to yield a thermoset polymer part with structural integrity and
   shape memory properties. Magneto-active iron oxide particles are added
   to the epoxy resin to create a filled resin that is mixed on demand with
   neat epoxy resin and curing agent; control over the mixing and
   deposition results in a customized distribution of iron oxide content
   spatially within a part. After characterizing the shape memory
   properties of the matrix epoxy, the magneto-active composites are shape
   programmed and actuated via the application of thermal and magnetic
   fields, respectively, and the effect of the functional grading on the
   magneto-active properties of the shape memory polymer is demonstrated.
   Analytical models are derived to predict the magnetic field-responsive
   behavior of the thermoset composites.},

Title = {Additive Manufacturing of Polymer/Bioactive Glass Scaffolds for
   Regenerative Medicine: A Review},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {11},
Month = {MAY 26},
Abstract = {Tissue engineering (TE) is a branch of regenerative medicine with
   enormous potential to regenerate damaged tissues using synthetic grafts
   such as scaffolds. Polymers and bioactive glasses (BGs) are popular
   materials for scaffold production because of their tunable properties
   and ability to interact with the body for effective tissue regeneration.
   Due to their composition and amorphous structure, BGs possess a
   significant affinity with the recipient's tissue. Additive manufacturing
   (AM), a method that allows the creation of complex shapes and internal
   structures, is a promising approach for scaffold production. However,
   despite the promising results obtained so far, several challenges remain
   in the field of TE. One critical area for improvement is tailoring the
   mechanical properties of scaffolds to meet specific tissue requirements.
   In addition, achieving improved cell viability and controlled
   degradation of scaffolds is necessary to ensure successful tissue
   regeneration. This review provides a critical summary of the potential
   and limitations of polymer/BG scaffold production via AM covering
   extrusion-, lithography-, and laser-based 3D-printing techniques. The
   review highlights the importance of addressing the current challenges in
   TE to develop effective and reliable strategies for tissue regeneration.},

   so an approach is made to locally add additives by a vibrational
   microfeeding system for metal and polymer powders. To realize a
   controlled powder discharge, the behavior of additives, which are
   dropped on a surface and on a powder bed is analyzed. Influencing
   factors for mass flow of the powders will be excitation frequency,
   excitation amplitude and capillary diameter on the side of experimental
   setup as well as particle size distribution and physical properties on
   the material side.},

Title = {Transversely isotropic hyperelastic-viscoplastic model for glassy
   polymers with application to additive manufactured photopolymers},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLASTICITY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {80},
Pages = {56-74},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A typical feature of additive manufactured photopolymers is that their
   mechanical modeldepends on the printing direction. Hence, this work aims
   at developing a material model to predict the inelastic deformation and
   failure of glassy polymers with such an effect. To achieve this goal, a
   transversely isotropic hyperelastic-viscoplastic model is proposed,
   which considers the effects of strain rate, pressure, temperature; and
   printing direction. In addition, a modified Tsai-Wu failure criterion is
   proposed to predict the macroscopic failure of glassy polymers with
   strain softening. The proposed model is applied to simulate the
   deformation and failure of additive manufactured lattice structures.
   Experimental and simulation results indicate that the mechanical
   behavior of additive manufactured lattice structures depends on not only
   the lattice orientation but also the printing direction. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has great potential on manufacturing both
   polymer and metal parts as final product. However, optimization of
   surface texture quality has not been fully achieved yet. AM surfaces
   present variable textures that differs according to the AM methods and
   process parameters. Because of their unusual texture, it is important to
   evaluate surface properties of metal and polymer parts produced by
   different AM processes. In this study, it is aimed to define 2D and 3D
   surface texture of poly-lactic acid (PLA) polymer and AlSi10Mg metal
   parts manufactured by Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) and Direct Metal
   Laser Sintering (DMLS) respectively. ISO 4287 Ra, Rq and Rz profile
   roughness parameters were defined by tactile method while ISO 25178 Sa,
   Sq and Sz areal parameters were measured by optical method. Measurements
   were taken from up-skin and down-skin of the samples which were in 30 mm
   diameter and 4 mm thickness. Results were evaluated within themselves
   and literature studies. Differences between profile and areal surface
   characterization and need of new specifications were also discussed.},

   Although the additive manufacturing was mainly used for the
   rapid-prototyping purposes, with the development of the high-performance
   thermoplastic materials, the produced components can be applied not only
   in the laboratory conditions, but also in the real operation. Therefore,
   it is necessary to consider also the environmental influences that can
   significantly shorten the component lifetime. This article presents the
   3D printing process for the selected thermoplastic polymers and the
   experimental verification of the strength analysis of the universal
   sensor holder together with the quantitative and qualitative comparison

Abstract = {Because of rapid progress in the electronics industry, the market has
   faced a huge demand for novel materials in the field of electromagnetic
   interference (EMI) shielding. Conductive functional polymer composites
   have demonstrated great potential to fulfill this requirement. To
   synthesize the polymeric composites, functional conductive nanoadditives
   such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, and MXene are commonly added to
   polymeric matrices, and the conductive polymer nanocomposites exhibit
   promising electrical conductivity as well as EMI shielding performance.
   Additive manufacturing (AM), also referred to as three-dimensional (3D)
   printing, has been increasingly employed to fabricate complicated
   geometry components in the medical, aerospace, and automotive
   industries. AM has also been used to fabricate advanced EMI shielding
   materials for sensors, supercapacitors, energy storage devices, and
   flexible electronics. This review aims at introducing the different 3D
   printing methods applied for the fabrication of EMI shielding polymer
   nanocomposites. The impact of the AM process on the functionality of the
   samples is also reviewed. Additionally, the influence of the nanofiller
   type and amount on the microstructure and performance of the fabricated
   nanocomposites is discussed. Finally, the prospects and recommended

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {By selective laser sintering (SLS), polymer powders are molten layer by
   layer to build conventional prototypes or parts in small series with
   geometrical freedom that cannot be achieved by other manufacturing
   technologies. The SLS process is mainly defined by the beam-matter
   interaction between powder material, laser radiation and different
   material characteristics by itself. However the determination of these
   different material characteristics is problematic because powder
   material imposes certain requirements that cannot sufficiently be
   provided by conventional measurement methods. Hence new fundamental
   investigation methods to determine the optical and thermal material
   characteristics like the thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity, or
   the influence of different heating rates on the melting behavior are
   presented in this paper. The different analysis methods altogether
   improve the process of understanding to allow recommendations for the
   future process controlling. (C) 2014 Laser Institute of America.},

Abstract = {Often, the responses of additive manufactured parts are studied only in
   the context of static loads, since most consumer-grade additive
   manufactured parts are not capable of supporting dynamic loads. Here,
   the effects of fabrication parameters on the vibratory properties of
   3D-printed polymer composite beams were studied. A total of 420
   vibratory system identification experiments were conducted on 70
   additive manufactured cantilever beams. In addition, Euler-Bernoulli
   beam theory and the finite element method were used to estimate the
   first natural frequency of the beams. It was found that build parameters
   change not only the stiffness of the beam, but these build parameters
   also affect the damping ratio. Furthermore, the frequency response of
   the beams is amplitude-dependent; this nonlinear effect is important in
   predicting the behavior of 3D printed structures. The complex
   relationship between the build parameters and the nonlinear vibratory
   response points to the possibility of creating tailored vibratory
   responses of 3D-printed structures. Since vibrations can cause
   accelerated wear, this work could also be important in determining
   accurate life cycle predictions of additive manufactured parts.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Abstract = {Natural and synthetic rubber is gaining increased interest in various
   industrial applications and daily life sectors (automotive industry,
   acoustic and electrical isolators, adhesives, impermeable surfaces, and
   others) due to its remarkable physicomechanical properties, excellent
   durability, and abrasive resistance. These great characteristics are
   accompanied by some recycling difficulties of the final products,
   particularly originated from the tire waste rubber industry. In this
   study, recycled tire rubber was incorporated in polymer matrices using
   selective laser sintering as 3D printing technology. Two polymers were
   used-polyamide and thermoplastic polyurethane, for their rigid and
   elastomeric properties, respectively. Polymer composites containing
   various tire powder amounts, up to 40 wt.\%, were prepared by physical
   blending. The final materials' morphological characteristics, mechanical
   properties, and thermal stability were evaluated. The proposed ambitious
   additive manufacturing approach looked over also some of the major
   aspects to be considered during the 3D printing procedure. In addition,
   examples of printed prototypes with potential applications were also
   proposed revealing the potential of the recycled tire rubber-loaded
   composites.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing enables fast manufacturing of polymer gears
   directly from a 3D model. Failed polymer gears can be replaced easily
   and quickly using many different materials. Mechanical and thermal

Journal = {ADVANCES IN INDUSTRIAL AND MANUFACTURING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This paper starts from the early developments and working principles of
   the additive manufacturing of polymers, continues with a glimpse on the
   extension to metals with identification and characterization of the two
   most widespread technologies, and ends with an overview of the recent
   developments in hybrid metal additive manufacturing.
   Earlier classifications of hybrid manufacturing with roots on the
   utilization of primarily processed raw materials in the form of ingots,
   sheets, rods, tubes, profiles, powders and pellets are revisited in the
   light of the emergence of a new type of hybridization resulting from the
   combination of additive manufacturing with traditional manufacturing
   processes.
   Special emphasis is given to the combination of additive manufacturing
   with forming processes with the twofold objective of (i) increasing the
   applicability domain of metal additive manufacturing and overcoming its
   limitations related to low productivity, metallurgical defects, rough
   surface quality and lack of dimensional precision, and (ii) adding
   flexibility and fostering new applications of traditional forming
   processes.},

Abstract = {The objective of this research is to develop a novel, multi-material
   additive manufacturing technique for fabricating laminated polymer
   nancomposite structures that have characteristic length-scales in the
   tens of millimeters range. The 3D printing technology presented in this
   paper combines the conventional inkjet-based printing of ultraviolet
   (UV) curable polymers with the deposition of either aligned or random
   nano-scale fiber mats, in between each printed layer. The fibers are
   first generated using an electrospinning process that produces the roll
   of fibers. These fibers are then transferred to the part being
   manufactured using a stamping operation. The process has been proven to
   manufacture multi-material laminated nanocomposites having different 3D
   geometries. The dimensional accuracy of the parts is seen to be a
   function of the interaction between the different UV-curable polymer
   inks. In general, the addition of the nanofibers in the form of
   laminates is seen to improve the mechanical properties of the material,
   with the Young's modulus and the ultimate breaking stress showing the
   most improvement. The pinning and deflection of micro-cracks by the
   nano-scale fiber mats has been identified to be the underlying mechanism
   responsible for these improved mechanical properties. The
   thermogravimetric analysis reveals that these improvements in the
   mechanical properties are obtained without drastically altering the
   thermal degradation pattern of the base polymer.},

Abstract = {Extrusion of high-melt-temperature polymers on large-format additive
   manufacturing (LFAM) machines releases particles and gases, though there
   is no data describing their physical and chemical characteristics.
   Emissions from two LFAM machines were monitored during extrusion of
   acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polycarbonate (PC) polymers as
   well as high-melt-temperature Ultem (poly(ether imide)), polysulfone
   (PSU), poly(ether sulfone) (PESU), and polyphenylene sulfide (PPS)
   polymers. Filter samples of particles were collected for quantification
   of elements and bisphenol A and S (BPA, BPS) and visualization of
   morphology. Individual gases were quantified on substance-specific
   media. Aerosol sampling demonstrated that concentrations of elements
   were generally low for all polymers, with a maximum of 1.6 mg/m(3) for
   iron during extrusion of Ultem. BPA, an endocrine disruptor, was
   released into air during extrusion of PC (range: 0.4 +/- 0.1 to 21.3 +/-
   5.3 mu g/m(3)). BPA and BPS (also an endocrine disruptor) were released
   into air during extrusion of PESU (BPA, 2.0-8.7 mu g/m(3); BPS,
   0.03-0.07 mu g/m(3)). Work surfaces and printed parts were contaminated
   with BPA (<8-587 ng/100 cm(2)) and BPS (<0.22-2.5 ng/100 cm(2)).
   Gas-phase sampling quantified low levels of respiratory irritants
   (phenol, SO2, toluene, xylenes), possible or known asthmagens
   (caprolactam, methyl methacrylate, 4-oxopentanal, styrene), and possible
   occupational carcinogens (benzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde) in air.
   Characteristics of particles and gases released by high-melt-temperature
   polymers during LFAM varied, which indicated the need for
   polymer-specific exposure and risk assessments. The presence of BPA and
   BPS on surfaces revealed a previously unrecognized source of dermal
   exposure for additive manufacturing workers using PC and PESU polymers.},

Abstract = {In the last decade, there has been considerable growth in the production
   of end-use polymer parts and components using additive manufacturing
   methods. A wide range of polymers, from Nylon-12 to thermoplastic
   polyurethane polymers, can be processed with complex geometry tailored
   to specific function. However, due to the nature of the layer-by-layer
   process used in additive manufacturing, high roughness surfaces remain
   on the parts. To reduce the roughness of the surfaces, a proprietary
   post-processing method, developed by Additive Manufacturing
   Technologies, is applied to the surfaces. To monitor and control the
   finishing of the surfaces, an in-process surface detection instrument
   has been developed based on machine vision and machine learning. This
   paper presents the machine learning approach and the effectiveness of
   the instrument for in-process measurement of the finished surfaces. (C)

Abstract = {The development of fibre composites in recent years has been remarkably
   strong, owing to their high performance and durability. Various
   advancements in fibre composites are emerging because of their increased
   use in a myriad of applications. One of the popular processing methods
   is additive manufacturing (AM), however, polymer-fibre composites
   manufactured through AM have a significantly lower strength compared to
   the conventional manufacturing processes, for instance, injection
   moulding. This article is a comprehensive review of the mechanical
   testing and performance analysis of polymer-fibre composites fabricated
   through AM, in particular fused deposition modelling (FDM). The review
   highlights the effect of the various processing parameters, involved in
   the FDM of polymer-fibre composites, on the observed mechanical
   properties. In addition, the thermal properties of FDM based fibre
   composites are also briefly reviewed. Overall, the review article has
   been structured to provide an impetus for researchers in the concerned
   engineering domain to gain an insight into the mechanical properties of
   fibre-reinforced polymeric composites manufactured through AM.},

Title = {Composites and Nanocomposites: Thermoplastic Polymers for Additive
   Manufacturing},
Booktitle = {ENCYCLOPEDIA OF POLYMER APPLICATIONS, VOLS I-III},
Year = {2019},
Pages = {486-500},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is considered as the next disruptive
   technology in manufacturing. Among all materials, polymers are the
   highly used materials, by volume, in AM. Fused deposition modeling (FDM)
   is a simple and cost-effective AM technology that employs mostly
   thermoplastic-based filaments. While FDM has been available for few
   decades, novel and versatile feedstock materials compatible with FDM has
   experienced significant expansion only recently. This report is aimed at
   providing an overview of the current research and development in the
   area of thermoplastic nano-composites for FDM printing. First, the
   principles of AM and FDM printing are introduced. Some common
   thermoplastics used for FDM including acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
   and polylactic acid are discussed. Thermoplastic nanocomposites are
   classified based on the functionalities that the nanomaterials offer.
   The FDM printing of the nanocomposites filled with mechanically
   reinforcing nanofillers (nanoclay and titanium oxide), multifunctional
   carbon-based nanofillers (carbon nanotube, graphene, and carbon
   nanofiber), and bioactive nanofillers (nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite
   and nanocrystalline beta-tricalcium phosphate) are covered. It is shown
   that how thermoplastic nanocomposites are FDM printed for a variety of
   applications including strong and stiff parts, conductive structures,
   electrochemical devices, sensors, and tissue regeneration. The
   advantages, challenges, and promises are also discussed. It is concluded
   that the adaptation of nanocomposites with FDM provides a platform where
   the capabilities of AM and the functionalities of nanomaterials can be
   integrated to design and fabricate novel and efficient material systems
   and structures. The field is relatively new and significant research and
   development are expected in the future.},

Abstract = {In recent years, additive manufacturing has been one of the most
   noteworthy technologies in the industry segment comprising high-voltage
   engineering and insulating materials. In this study, the influence of
   the surface roughness of an additive manufacturing polymer on the
   surface flashover voltage is investigated. We prepared two types of
   sample plate having the same volume resistivity and surface resistivity
   but different surface roughness by changing the building orientation
   (horizontally built and vertically built) of a 3D printer. By surface
   profile measurement and analysis of the arithmetic average roughness, it
   was revealed that the vertically built sample plate has a groove-like
   structure on the surface. Furthermore, it was shown that the surface
   flashover voltage in the direction perpendicular to the groove structure
   is about 20\% times larger than in the parallel direction. In addition,
   it became clear that the relationship between the surface flashover
   voltage and the inter-electrode distance is well expressed in a
   flashover model in vacuum.},

   extrusion based additive manufacturing through in situ high speed
   imaging and thermal conductivity measurements},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Pages = {132-139},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing has gained significant research attention due to
   multiple advantages over traditional manufacturing technologies. A
   fundamental understanding of the relationships between process
   parameters, microstructure and functional properties of built parts is
   critical for optimizing the additive manufacturing process and building
   parts with desired properties. This is also critical for a
   multi-functional part where the process needs to be optimized with
   respect to disparate performance requirements such as mechanical
   strength and thermal conductivity. This paper presents in situ high
   speed imaging and build-direction thermal conductivity measurements of
   polymer extrusion based additively manufactured parts in order to
   understand the effect of process parameters such as raster speed, infill
   percentage and layer height on build-direction thermal conductivity.
   Measurements of thermal conductivity using a one-dimensional heat flux
   method are correlated with in situ process images obtained from a high
   speed camera as well as cross section images of the built part. Results
   indicate strong dependence of build-direction thermal conductivity on
   raster speed, layer thickness and infill percentage, which is
   corroborated by high speed imaging of the printing process at different
   values of these process parameters. Key trade-offs between process
   throughput and thermal properties are also identified. In addition to
   enhancing our fundamental understanding of polymer extrusion based
   additive manufacturing and its influence on thermal properties of built
   parts, results presented here may facilitate process optimization
   towards parts with desired thermal and multi-functional properties.},

Abstract = {In developing countries conventional prosthetic feet are preferred over
   the technologically advanced state of the art bionics, as these are made
   out of inexpensive materials by local vendors, bringing down the overall
   cost to a quite affordable price with extraordinary functionality, for
   amputees here. The work is focussed on standardising Jaipur foot
   fabrication by use of additive manufacturing. The goal is to obtain a
   reliable, light, interchangeable and robust product which could be
   produced with same accuracy in any facility with right set of equipment
   avoiding human-induced error. The compression strength test results
   provided a way higher modulus for additively manufactured thermoplastic
   polyurethane in comparison to microcellular rubber. The microcellular
   rubber comprises more than 60\% of the foot by volume and weight,
   substitution of such a material with lighter and more reliable polymer
   brings about not just a comparable but also a better prosthetic foot on
   various fronts.},

Title = {From trash to treasure in additive manufacturing: Recycling of polymer

Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {71},
Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {A persistent problem in laser powder bed fusion (PBF) additive
   manufacturing (AM) of polymers is the accu-mulation of used feedstock
   material that cannot be reprocessed due to alterations in the physical
   and chemical structure upon ageing at elevated temperatures. The
   chemical ageing of polyamide 12, the most frequently used feedstock in
   PBF of polymers, occurs due to solid-state post-condensation during the
   AM process and can be reversed by appropriate processing. This paper
   investigates the application of acid-catalyzed hydrolytic
   recon-ditioning to restore virgin powder properties from used and
   annealed feedstock material, highlighting a pathway to more
   sustainability in AM. The proposed method is optimized towards
   PBF-printing relevant properties and mechanical characteristics of parts
   build with the recycled feedstock material, which are benchmarked
   against conventional powder refreshing strategies.},

Journal = {MECHANICS OF ADVANCED MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 5},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a numerical approach for predicting residual
   stresses induced during the additive manufacturing (AM) of polymer
   composites and their effect on the deformation behavior of the
   composites. A finite element (FE) model was developed on Abaqus/Standard
   for 3D printing of layered polymer composite using three polymers: HDPE,
   PVC, and ABS. The material properties of pure polymers and their blends
   were measured through tensile testing of injection-molded specimens.
   These properties were then used as input data in the FE model for the
   regions of pure polymers and their interfaces. An uncoupled
   thermo-mechanical analysis was performed, where a heat transfer analysis
   was realized first using elements birth (activation/deactivation)
   technique and a moving cylindrical volumetric heat source as a Fortran
   subroutine (DFLUX). With temperature input from thermal simulation, a
   mechanical analysis was carried out to deform the polymer composites
   along and across the print direction, i.e. under isostrain and isostress
   conditions, respectively. It was observed that the theoretical models
   existing in the literature underestimate the material properties as they
   do not consider the residual stresses developed during fabrication. The
   FE simulations predicted that the estimated material properties were 10
   to 50\% different from those calculated by the theoretical models,
   depending upon the residual stress level and the print direction.},

Abstract = {Defects can result in a failed part and are costly in terms of time and
   material. This cost is even greater in the context of large-scale
   additive manufacturing where the objects can be very large. As a result,
   a great deal of research has focused on defect identification and
   mitigation. To address defects during object construction, researchers
   at Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Manufacturing Demonstration Facility
   investigated an in-situ control system comprised of two sensors: a
   thermal camera and laser profilometer. This control system adjusted
   material flow and build speed to mitigate three types of defects: low
   layer times, underfill, and overfill. Several test objects were
   constructed. The control system was found to adjust build parameters to
   handle low layer times of approximately 15 seconds and height deviations
   from -100\% underfill (the absence of a layer) to 50\% overfill. Within
   two layers, height deviations could be returned to within 10\% of the
   expected layer height. Further, preliminary results suggest the system
   can compensate for uneven build surfaces. (c) 2020 The Authors.

Abstract = {Anisotropy in dielectric properties can have deleterious effects in
   structures intended for use in high-field environments. We show that
   dielectric anisotropy is introduced into parts fabricated using additive
   manufacturing techniques based on the orientation in which the part is
   printed. Dielectric strength testing data, based on the ASTM D149
   standard, are presented for samples fabricated using the polymer jetting
   (PolyJet), stereolithography (SLA), fused deposition modeling (FDM), and
   selective laser sintering (SLS) additive manufacturing techniques. Each
   unique printing direction available, based on the printing method, was
   examined in turn. Each printing technique was found to introduce
   anisotropic dielectric properties within the sample coupons that were a
   function of the original orientation in which the part was printed, and
   the direction of structural susceptibility was found to be print-method
   dependent. Differences in dielectric strength for coupons printed in
   different orientations were found to exceed 70\% for some combinations
   of printing technique and polymer. Overall, test coupons printed with
   stereolithography (SLA) were found to exhibit the lowest degree of
   dielectric strength anisotropy between print orientations. Dielectric
   failure mechanisms are discussed.},

Title = {Image-based determination of spatial and temporal distribution of
   refractive index during polymer curing in additive manufacturing of
   optics},

Abstract = {In many fields and applications a spatially resolved measurement of the
   refractive index is desirable. This also applies to the additive
   manufacturing of optical components and is especially true in the
   special case of photopolymerization of liquid resins by UV irradiation.
   The key point here is that the resulting refractive index of the optical
   component to be printed depends on the degree of cure of the polymer.
   The latter is directly related to the UV irradiance used for curing.
   Thus, a local variation of the irradiance can enable a local variation
   of the refractive index of the additively manufactured optical
   component. In order to set a defined refractive index distribution, it
   is desirable to measure the refractive index during the
   photopolymerization of the resin in a temporally and spatially resolved
   manner. In this article, a method is discussed with which this can be
   achieved. The basic principle is that the polymer under investigation is
   brought into contact with a prism and, based on the principle of total
   reflection at the interface between prism and polymer, the refractive
   index of the sample can be inferred.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D-printing technology, is
   currently integrated in many fields as it possesses an attractive
   fabrication process. In this work, we deployed the 3D-print
   stereolithography (SLA) method to print polyurethane acrylate
   (PUA)-based gel polymer electrolyte (GPE). The printed PUA GPE was then
   characterized through several techniques, such as Fourier transform
   infrared (FTIR), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), X-ray
   diffraction analysis (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron microscope
   (SEM). The printed GPE exhibited high ionic conductivity of 1.24 x
   10(-3) S cm(-1) at low-lithium-salt content (10 wt.\%) in ambient
   temperature and favorable thermal stability to about 300 degrees C. The
   FTIR results show that addition of LiClO4 to the polymer matrix caused a
   shift in carbonyl, ester and amide functional groups. In addition, FTIR
   deconvolution peaks of LiClO4 show 10 wt.\% has the highest amount of
   free ions, in line with the highest conductivity achieved. Finally, the
   PUA GPE was printed into 3D complex structure to show SLA flexibility in
   designing an electrolyte, which could be a potential application in
   advanced battery fabrication.},

Abstract = {A type of orange carbon dots (O-CDs) synthesized via an ultrasonication
   route with citric acid and 1,2-phenylenediamine as precursors was
   embedded into sodium polyacrylate (SPA) as the ink for 3D printing.
   Characterizations of these spherical O-CDs revealed an ultra-small size
   (similar to 2 nm) and excitation-independent, but solvent dependent,
   emission. The O-CDs were evenly distributed with low degree of
   aggregation in sodium polyacrylate (SPA), which was achieved due to the
   property that SPA can absorb water together with O-CDs. The 3D printed
   photoluminescent objective with the ink revealed a great potential for
   high yield application of these materials for additive manufacturing.
   This also represents the first time, bare CDs have been reported as a
   photoluminescent material in 3D printing, as well as the first time SPA
   has been reported as a material for 3D printing.},

Title = {Additive manufacturing of promising heterostructure for biomedical
   applications},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXTREME MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {As a new generation of materials/structures, heterostructure is
   characterized by heterogeneous zones with dramatically different
   mechanical, physical or chemical properties. This endows heterostructure
   with unique interfaces, robust architectures, and synergistic effects,
   making it a promising option as advanced biomaterials for the highly
   variable anatomy and complex functionalities of individual patients.
   However, the main challenges of developing heterostructure lie in the
   control of crystal/phase evolution and the distribution/fraction of
   components and structures. In recent years, additive manufacturing
   techniques have attracted increasing attention in developing
   heterostructure due to the unique flexibility in tailored structures and
   synthetic multimaterials. This review focuses on the additive
   manufacturing of heterostructure for biomedical applications. The
   structural features and functional mechanisms of heterostructure are
   summarized. The typical material systems of heterostructure, mainly
   including metals, polymers, ceramics, and their composites, are
   presented. And the resulting synergistic effects on multiple properties
   are also systematically discussed in terms of mechanical, biocompatible,
   biodegradable, antibacterial, biosensitive and magnetostrictive
   properties. Next, this work outlines the research progress of additive
   manufacturing employed in developing heterostructure from the aspects of
   advantages, processes, properties, and applications. This review also
   highlights the prospective utilization of heterostructure in biomedical
   fields, with particular attention to bioscaffolds, vasculatures,
   biosensors and biodetections. Finally, future research directions and
   breakthroughs of heterostructure are prospected with focus on their more
   prospective applications in infection prevention and drug delivery.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing, in particular powder bed-based fabrication
   processes hold promise to revolutionize biomedical engineering for the
   ability to provide customized, functional implants, for example as bone
   replacement materials. However, providing functional powder particles
   that unify material requirements for biodegradable and bioactive
   biomaterials and process requirements to enable successful powder bed
   fusion remains an unmet challenge. Here, a supraparticle-based approach
   to create biodegradable poly(lactic acid) and composite powders for the
   additive manufacturing of bone replacement materials is introduced.
   Colloidal binary Ca-SiO2 glasses and hydroxyapatite are incorporated as
   bioactive functional additives to support the formation of bone-like
   calcium phosphate. The supraparticle powders are prepared by a scalable
   spray-drying process, which offers control of particle size, shape, and
   composition. All process-relevant powder characteristics are analyzed as
   a function of composition and structure, including flowability, thermal,
   and melt rheological properties. The optimized supraparticle powders are
   successfully used in the process of laser powder bed fusion of polymers
   to prepare macroscopic specimens via additive manufacturing. It is
   demonstrated that the material combination of the composites provides
   relevant functional properties, including biodegradation and
   bioactivity. The process provides a flexible and adjustable toolbox for

Abstract = {The high demand for an efficient energy supply for various applications
   facilitates the development of innovative storage technologies like
   all-solid-state batteries in addition to novel production technologies.
   Compared to the conventional manufacturing process, additive
   manufacturing (AM) is a promising technology used for the rapid and
   cost-effective production of battery components containing separators.
   However, AM technologies like laser-based powder bed fusion of polymers
   (PBF-LB/P) have been neglected so far. The present research aims to fill
   this research gap and outline a novel approach for processing polymers
   like polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) into
   separators using PBF-LB/P. Optimal process parameters for manufacturing
   PVDF and PEO with PBF-LB/P to generate homogeneous and dense layers
   represent the key findings of this paper and provide a deeper process
   understanding. The first proof of concept for producing separator layers
   by PBF-LB/P in a scalable process is demonstrated as a result.},

Title = {New Methodology for Evaluating Surface Quality of Experimental
   Aerodynamic Models Manufactured by Polymer Jetting Additive
   Manufacturing},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The additive manufacturing (AM) applications have attracted a great deal
   of interest with regard to experimental aerodynamic studies. There is a
   need for a universal roughness scale that characterizes different
   materials used in aerodynamic research. The main purpose of this paper
   is identification of the potential of a material jetting AM process to
   produce accurate aerodynamic surfaces. A new methodology to evaluate the
   roughness of aerodynamic profiles (airfoils) was proposed. A very
   short-span wing artifact for preliminary tests and a long-span wing
   model were proposed for design of experiments. Different artifacts
   orientations were analyzed, maintaining the same surface quality on the
   upper and lower surface of the wing. A translucent polymeric resin was
   used for samples manufacturing by polymer jetting (PolyJet) technology.
   The effects of main factors on the surface roughness of the wing were
   investigated using the statistical design of experiments. Three interest
   locations, meaning the leading-edge, central, and trailing-edge zones,
   on the upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil were considered. The best
   results were obtained for a sample oriented at XY on the build platform,
   in matte finish type, with a mean Ra roughness in the range of 2 to 3.5
   mu m. Microscopy studies were performed to analyze and characterize the
   surfaces of the wing samples on their different zones.},

Journal = {MATERIALS LETTERS},

Volume = {352},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {A new additive manufacturing method using metal paste was developed, in
   order to reduce waste caused by powder recycling in conventional powder
   bed fusion and maintain a high density in the fabricated parts. The
   paste was composed of metal powder, polymer particles, and a volatile
   solvent. Experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of a
   low polymer content on the paste during processing, surface topology
   before and after melting, and microstructure of the single-layer
   samples. The results showed that polymer addition could prevent the
   formation of powder clots by improving homogeneity of the metal paste
   and suppressing defect generation. The polymer also led to a smoother
   surface by reducing the spatter size. Finer grains were observed in the
   sample produced at higher polymer content.},

Abstract = {As the application space for large-scale 3D printed components continues
   to grow, it is necessary to identify appropriate processing conditions
   for high-performance thermoplastics on large format Additive
   Manufacturing (LFAM) systems. This study compares the rheological
   behavior of a high-performance thermoplastic, polyphenylsulfone (PPSU),
   with that of a commonly used low-temperature polymer, acrylonitrile
   butadiene styrene (ABS), to identify suitable processing conditions for
   large format AM systems. The linear viscoelastic properties (complex
   viscosity, storage modulus, loss modulus, and tan delta) of these
   materials are evaluated as a function of temperature, angular frequency,
   and carbon fiber content. Over the range of frequencies of interest to
   LFAM (10-100 rad/s), ABS behaves more like an elastic solid whereas PPSU
   behaves more like a viscous liquid. The addition of 20-35\% by weight of
   carbon fiber increased the shear thinning effect of both thermoplastics,
   showing a potential variation of 2-3x over the range of expected LFAM
   extrusion shear rates (10-100 s(-1)).},

Title = {Flexible and multi-material intrinsically conductive polymer devices
   fabricated via DLP and DIW additive manufacturing techniques},
Journal = {RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 24},
Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this study is to explore the synthesis of novel
   conductive photo-resins to produce flexible conducting composites for
   use in additive manufacturing. By using direct ink writing (DIW)
   additive manufacturing, this study aims to explore the fabrication of
   multimaterial devices with conductive and insulating components. Using
   digital light processing (DLP) additive manufacturing, this study aims
   to fabricate detailed objects with higher resolution than material
   extrusion 3D printing systems. Design/methodology/approachIn this paper,
   several photocurable conducting resins were prepared for DIW and DLP
   additive manufacturing. These resins were then cured using 405 nm near
   UV light to create intrinsically conductive polymer (ICP) composites.
   The electrochemical properties of these composites were analysed, and
   the effect of co-monomer choice and crosslinking density was determined.
   These results determined a suitable resin for subsequent additive
   manufacture using DIW and DLP. These 3D printing techniques were used to
   develop flexible conducting devices of submillimetre resolution that
   were fabricated with unmodified, commercially available 3D printers.
   FindingsCyclic voltammetry and volume conductivity analysis of the
   conducting resins determined the most conductive resin formula for 3D
   printing. Conductive devices were fabricated using the two 3D printing
   techniques. A multimaterial soft conducting device was fabricated using
   DIW, and each conducting component was insulated from its neighbours.
   DLP was used to fabricate a soft conducting device with good XY
   resolution with a minimum feature size of 0.2 mm. All devices were
   prepared in unmodified commercially available 3D printers. Practical
   implicationsThese findings have value in the development of soft
   robotics, artificial muscles and wearable sensors. In addition, this
   work highlights techniques for DIW and DLP additive manufacturing.
   Originality/valueSeveral original conducting resin formulae were
   developed for use in two 3D printing systems. The resulting 3D-printed
   composites are soft and flexible while maintaining their conductive
   properties. These findings are of value to both polymer chemists and to
   the field of additive manufacturing.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, has been used
   for rapid prototyping due to its ability to produce parts with complex

   materials have unique mechanical properties such as strength, corrosion
   resistance, and temperature resistance. This paper provides a review of
   recent AM techniques for ceramics such as extrusion-based AM, the
   mechanical properties of additively manufactured ceramics, and the
   applications of ceramics in various industries, including aerospace,
   automotive, energy, electronics, and medical. A detailed overview of
   binder-jetting, laser-assisted processes, laminated object manufacturing
   (LOM), and material extrusion-based 3D printing is presented. Finally,
   the challenges and opportunities in AM of ceramics are identified.},

   Polycaprolactone},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Polycaprolactone (PCL) is a resorbable semicrystalline polymer that
   degrades slowly via hydrolysis and has applications in medical implants
   and drug delivery. As a result of its low melting point, PCL can be
   processed easily by conventional polymer processing techniques. However,
   the additive manufacturing of PCL remains a challenge, mainly due to the
   fact that there are no commercially available filaments for traditional
   fused deposition modeling (FDM). Furthermore, when the materials are
   fabricated via FDM for drug delivery applications, the high temperature
   may deactivate the incorporated drugs/biomolecules. This study
   investigates the solution extrusion additive manufacturing of PCL using
   a lab-developed solution-type device. The device comprises a solution
   extrusion feeder, driving stepper motors, a power source, a syringe
   equipped with a dispensing tip, an accumulation platform, and a control
   interface. The influences of different manufacturing parameters on part
   quality were evaluated. The experimental results suggest that the
   tensile strength of the additively manufactured parts increases with
   fill density but decreases with the ratio of PCL to dichloromethane
   (DCM) and moving speed of the dispensing tip. Parts fabricated by 90
   degrees print orientation of infill exhibited the greatest mechanical
   strength. The fabricated parts tend to heal the gaps among strips after
   additive manufacturing, but tiny pores can still be seen on the
   surfaces.},

Journal = {COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {215},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {There is a large amount of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) waste
   generated annually, mainly due to the difficulty in recycling CFRPs.
   This work presents a novel additive manufacturing-based recycling
   approach that can be used to reclaim CFRP waste and to re-manufacture
   the carbon fiber into 3D printed composite parts. A trial of this idea
   was set up, in which carbon fiber was first reclaimed from CFRP waste
   using supercritical fluid and then mixed with Poly-Ether-Ether-Ketone to
   produce composite filaments. The filaments were then fed into a printer
   of fused deposition modeling (i.e., a 3D printing process) and the
   recycled CFRP parts were fabricated. The engineering
   application-oriented tests demonstrate that the reclaimed carbon fiber
   can modify the performances of 3D printed part effectively in terms of
   mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, heat conduction and wear
   resistance. This work illustrates that the additive manufacturing-based
   recycling approach offers a possible strategy to recycle CFRP waste and
   fabricate high-performance engineering parts with complex geometries,
   which are economical and environmentally friendly.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes the integration of pulsed photonic sintering into
   multi-material additive manufacturing processes in order to produce
   multifunctional components that would be nearly impossible to produce
   any other way. Pulsed photonic curing uses high power Xenon flash lamps
   to thermally fuse printed nanomaterials such as conductive metal inks.
   To determine the feasibility of the proposed integration, three
   different polymer additive manufacturing materials were exposed to
   typical flash curing conditions using a Novacentrix Pulseforge 3300
   system. FTIR analysis revealed virtually no change in the polymer
   substrates, thus indicating that the curing energy did not damage the
   polymer. Next, copper traces were printed on the same substrate, dried,
   and photonically cured to establish the feasibility of thermally fusing
   copper metal on the polymer additive manufacturing substrates. Although
   drying defects were observed, electrical resistivity values ranging from
   0.081 to 0.103 Omega/sq. indicated that high temperature and easily
   oxidized metals can be successfully printed and cured on several
   commonly used polymer additive manufacturing materials. These results
   indicate that pulsed photonic curing holds tremendous promise as an
   enabling technology for next generation multi-material additive
   manufacturing processes.},

Abstract = {In this work, we propose a novel hybrid additive manufacturing

   powders and subsequent preceramic polymer infiltration and pyrolysis to
   manufacture Silicon Carbide components for complex architectures. By
   controlling the porosity of the sintered polymeric preform we are able
   to control the shrinkage upon the first infiltration and pyrolysis. This
   enabled the manufacturing of smaller features than those achievable with
   other manufacturing techniques. The mechanical strength of the resulting
   ceramic increased with the number of reinfiltration cycles up to 24 MPa,
   inversely the residual porosity decreased to 10 vol\%. The
   microstructure showed two distinct phases of SiOC and SiC. The first was
   attributed to the interaction between the porous polyamide and the
   ceramic precursor during the first infiltration. SiC derived from the
   pyrolysis of the preceramic precursor alone.},

   distribution. A fibre path generator was created utilising Gcode to
   emulate the weft-warp components of a woven construction using a
   continuous carbon fibre filament. This new pathing technique also allows
   for a woven structure to be integrated with features (such as notches)
   previously only possible through destructive machining processes. In
   order to evaluate the performance of the printed composites, open hole
   tensile studies were carried out in which 6 mm holes were routed into
   the composite structure and the resulting part's mechanical performance
   were compared with specimens which had been die punched as well as an
   unnotched control group. The latter exhibited strengths equivalent to
   49\% that of unnotched specimen. In contrast the specimens with woven
   holes exhibited strengths which were 44\% higher, just 7\% lower than
   the strength achieved for the unnotched specimens. Digital image
   correlation (DIC) analysis also demonstrated significantly reduced
   strain concentration around the printed hole perimeter, compared with
   that for the die punched hole.},

Abstract = {Current methods for compactly joining High Temperature Polymer Matrix
   Composites (HTPMC's) and metals used in engine components often rely on
   structural adhesives. These methods have inherent challenges such as
   verification of the bond quality, strength and temperature limitation of
   the polymer in the adhesive, interfacial adhesion strength and wetting
   between the metal and polymer, and a lack of load transfer via fiber
   reinforcement across the joint or via interlocking.
   This work will discuss efforts to develop an innovative solution for
   hybrid joining of a metal to HTPMC using state-of-the art additive
   manufacturing and processing techniques. Ti-6Al-4V powder is deposited
   using the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process onto carbon fiber
   fabrics, and the fabrics' bottom layer is then infused with a polymer.
   Ultimately, the hybrid composite consists of a fully densified metal on
   one face and an HTPMC on the opposing face, with a tailored transition
   region containing a significant amount of fiber reinforcement connecting
   the two faces. This hybrid material will be tested to establish its
   mechanical and physical properties on a small scale, and its
   microstructure will be characterized as the overall scope of this work.
   This paper is focused on the first part of the hybrid whereas the
   deposition of Ti-6Al-4V powder onto carbon fabrics was achieved with
   optimum processing parameter using SLM method.},

Title = {Layered fiber orientation optimization for continuous fiber reinforced
   polymer additive manufacturing using multi-material topology
   optimization},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 30},
Abstract = {With increasing demand for lightweight components in many industries,
   components must be optimized to save as much weight as possible. One of
   the main optimization tools employed by designers is topology
   optimization as it identifies the critical load paths within components.
   An even more powerful tool is multi-material topology optimization
   (MMTO) due to it also optimizing material selection in a component. By
   incorporating material selection into the optimization, new material
   options can be included to further improve upon the objective. The major
   drawback of MMTO is that the designs produced are often not
   manufacturable. Traditionally, these results would be interpreted by
   designers and modified to produce a manufacturable design. To reduce the
   amount of changes to the optimal design and simplify the design process,
   constraints can be made to tailor the optimization result to a chosen
   manufacturing method. This paper focuses on continuous fiber reinforced
   polymer additive manufacturing (CFRPAM). Being an additive manufacturing
   process, CFRPAM is able to realize the complex geometry often seen in
   topology optimization with little intervention while the continuous
   fiber reinforcement allows the process to produce high strength
   components. The research presented in this paper adapts a material model
   of the continuous fiber reinforced polymer and constrains the optimizer
   to solutions readily manufacturable with CFRPAM. The resulting
   methodology achieves simultaneous layered fiber orientation optimization
   and topology optimization. The method is shown to reduce compliance by
   up to 22.1\% compared to the current industry standard.},

Title = {Continuous Fiber Angle Topology Optimization for Polymer Composite
   Deposition Additive Manufacturing Applications},
Journal = {FIBERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Mechanical properties of parts produced with polymer deposition additive
   manufacturing (AM) depend on the print bead direction, particularly when
   short carbon-fiber reinforcement is added to the polymer feedstock. This
   offers a unique opportunity in the design of these structures since the
   AM print path can potentially be defined in a direction that takes
   advantage of the enhanced stiffness gained in the bead and, therefore,
   fiber direction. This paper presents a topology optimization approach
   for continuous fiber angle optimization (CFAO), which computes the best
   layout and orientation of fiber reinforcement for AM structures.
   Statically loaded structures are designed for minimum compliance where
   the adjoint variable method is used to compute design derivatives, and a
   sensitivity filter is employed to reduce the checkerboard effect. The
   nature of the layer-by-layer approach in AM is given special
   consideration in the algorithm presented. Examples are provided to
   demonstrate the applicability of the method in both two and three
   dimensions. The solution to our two dimensional problem is then printed
   with a fused filament fabrication (FFF) desktop printer using the
   material distribution results and a simple infill method which
   approximates the optimal fiber angle results using a contour-parallel
   deposition strategy. Mechanical stiffness testing of the printed parts
   shows improved results as compared to structures designed without
   accounting for the direction of the composite structure. Results show
   that the mechanical properties of the final FFF carbon fiber/polymer
   composite printed parts are greatly influenced by the print direction,
   and optimized material orientation tends to align with the imposed force
   direction to minimize the compliance.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (aka 3D printing) has excellent potential for
   developing advanced materials and technologies, and it's extensively
   been explored in several areas such as tissue engineering, cancer
   research, multifunctional devices, surgical preparation, and printable
   electronics than a decade. This review highlights the emerging advances
   in additive manufacturing-enabled hydrogels and their composites. The
   mechanical features of 3D printed hydrogels that show strong tissue
   adaptability, and the hydrogels that incorporate water within moist
   states, demonstrate their potential for a multitude of applications, for
   example, wound dressings. Recently, the 3D printing of bio-based
   hydrogels and other polymers has been considered a viable path toward
   ultimate regenerative treatment. Here, we provide an overview of (i)
   polymer additive manufacturing processes, (ii) different
   polysaccharides-based hydrogels, and (iii) the different applications of
   bio-based hydrogels in 3D printing. Lastly, we conclude our discussion
   by highlighting the future research directions.

Abstract = {Polymer nanocomposites have attracted increasing interest in research
   and development with several current and potential industrial
   applications due to their wide margin of superiority over conventional
   materials. Polymer composites provide a higher strength-to-weight ratio,
   easily customizable product properties, flexible manufacturing
   processes, high resistance to corrosion or erosion, and lower cost. The
   recent progress in additive manufacturing (AM) methods has paved the way
   for even a broader range of flexibilities in design and materials in
   several industrial sectors, including aerospace, biomedical,
   construction, electronics, telecommunication, mechanical, and defense.
   However, some hindrances remain in the synthesis of polymer composites
   and their fabrication through AM technologies. A comparative review of
   AM processes for polymer composites and their applications is presented
   in this study. This study aims to provide engineers and scientists with
   an updated understanding of the underlying issues, barriers,
   limitations, and opportunities. It will also help the reader to

Abstract = {High-quality scaffolds play a vital role in tissue engineering. The
   frozen-form method (FFM) (also known as low-temperature deposition
   manufacturing) can be used to fabricate scaffolds from biomedical
   polymers. These scaffolds may have both macroporous and microporous
   characteristics and may incorporate bioactive compounds or biomolecules
   during the process. In addition, scaffolds produced at low temperatures
   can prevent the occurrence of thermal hydrolysis, thereby improving the
   mechanical properties of scaffolds. In fabricating high-quality (without
   deformation and collapse) bioscaffolds through the FFM, the most crucial
   requirement is the creation of a uniform low-temperature environment.
   This study developed a frozen-form additive manufacturing system that
   includes a uniform cryogenic device to generate the uniform distribution
   of a low-temperature environment over a local region to produce large
   scaffolds that will not deform and collapse. A large square scaffold
   block and a high aspect ratio tubular scaffold were fabricated to verify
   the efficiency of this system. Furthermore, this study employed a
   selective compliance assembly robot arm to traverse two-dimensional
   deposition paths, unlike the conventional Cartesian gantry system. This
   study investigated the challenges stemming from the use of such a device
   for scaffold production and suggests methods for resolving such issues.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Polymer composites have been widely used in the aviation, aerospace,
   automotive, military, medical, agricultural and industrial fields due to
   their excellent mechanical properties, heat resistance, flame retardant,
   impact resistance and corrosion resistance. In general, their
   manufacturing process is one of the key factors affecting the life cycle
   of polymer composites. This article provides an overview of typical
   manufacturing technologies, including surface coating, additive
   manufacturing and magnetic pulse powder compaction, which are normally
   used to reduce the failure behaviour of polymer composites in service so
   that the quality of composite products can be improved. Advanced polymer
   composite powder manufacturing processes, the processing mechanism and
   experimental methods are described, and the influence of different
   manufacturing processes on the moulding quality is revealed. This
   investigation can provide suitable methods for the selection of
   manufacturing technology to improve the quality of polymer composite

Title = {Room-Temperature Solid-State UV Cross-Linkable Vitrimer-like Polymers
   for Additive Manufacturing},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this paper, a UV cross-linkable vitrimer-like polymer,
   ureidopyrimidinone functionalized telechelic polybutadiene, is reported.
   It is synthesized in two steps. First,
   2(6-isocyanatohexylaminocarbonylamino)-6-methyl-4{[}1H]-pyrimidinone
   (UPy-NCO) reacts with hydroxy-functionalized polybutadiene (HTPB) to
   obtain UPy-HTPB-UPy, and then the resulted UPy-HTPB-UPy is cross-linked
   under 365 nm UV light (photo-initiator: bimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone,
   DMPA). Further investigation reveals that the density of cross-linking
   and mechanical properties of the resulting polymers can be tailored via
   varying the amount of photo-initiator and UV exposure time. Before UV
   cross-linking, UPy-HTPB-UPy is found to be vitrimer-like due to the
   quadruple hydrogen-bonding interactions. The UPy groups at the end of
   the chain also enable for rapid solidification upon the evaporation of
   the solvent. The unsaturated double bonds in the HTPB chains enable
   UPy-HTPB-UPy to be UV cross-linkable in the solid state at room
   temperature. After cross-linking, the polymers have good shape memory
   effect (SME). Here, we demonstrate that this type of polymer can have
   many potential applications in additive manufacturing. In the cases of
   fused deposition modelling (FDM) and direct ink writing (DIW), not only
   the strength of the interlayer bonding but also the strength of the
   polymer itself can be enhanced via UV exposure (from thermoplastic to
   thermoset) either during printing or after printing. The SME after
   cross-linking further helps to achieve rapid volumetric additive
   manufacturing anytime and anywhere.},

Abstract = {Purpose Material extrusion additive manufacturing, also known as fused
   deposition modeling, is a manufacturing technique in which objects are
   built by depositing molten materials layer-by-layer through a nozzle.
   The use and application of this technique has risen dramatically over
   the past decade. This paper aims to first, report on the production and
   characterization of a shape memory polymer material filament that was
   manufactured to print shape memory polymer objects using material
   extrusion additive manufacturing. Additionally, it aims to investigate
   and outline the effects of major printing parameters, such as print
   orientation and infill percentage, on the elastic and mechanical
   properties of printed shape memory polymer samples.
   Design/methodology/approach Infill percentage was tested at three
   levels, 50, 75 and 100 per cent, while print orientation was tested at
   four different angles with respect to the longitudinal axis of the
   specimens at 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees and 90 degrees. The
   properties examined were elastic modulus, ultimate tensile strength and
   maximum strain.
   Findings Results showed that print angle and infill percentage do have a
   significant impact on the manufactured test samples.
   Originality/value Findings can significantly influence the tailored
   design and manufacturing of smart structures using shape memory polymer
   and material extrusion additive manufacturing.},

   technical review and status of design methodologies},
Journal = {COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {255},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) of fiber-reinforced composites is gaining
   traction as an important manufacturing technology to produce complex,
   highly customized structures. AM processes enable the fabrication of
   complex 3D structures with control over fiber position and orientation,
   offering tremendous design freedom. Although the use of AM to fabricate
   fiber-reinforced composites is promising, various design difficulties
   remain. These include consideration of structural performance subject to
   manufacturing constraints on fiber placement, orientation, bend radius,
   and other relevant limitations. Design engineers will have to consider
   these limitations to be able to reap the full benefits of AM to
   fabricate fiber-reinforced polymer composites. This paper aims to
   provide a survey on the advances in multi-scale topology optimization,
   fiber orientation parameterization, micromechanics of fiber-matrix
   interactions and process planning specific for the AM of complex fiber
   reinforced composites. The status of recent research is summarized, and
   future directions outlined.},

Journal = {SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {266},
Pages = {85-92},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Polyvinyldene fluoride (PVDF) polymer piezoelectric actuators were
   manufactured using an electric poling-assisted additive manufacturing
   (EPAM) process and tested for actuation strain in the thickness
   direction. A heterodyne interferometer was used to measure the strain
   developed by the actuators as a function of applied voltage. Results
   were compared to a commercially available ceramic
   lead-zirconium-titanate (PZT) actuator. The EPAM PVDF samples exhibit
   strains up to 8.78 m epsilon, compared to 1.7 m epsilon developed by PZT
   samples at their maximum working voltages in linear ramp testing (860 V
   for EPAM PVDF and 200 V for PZT). The response of the EPAM PVDF samples
   to an applied force was tested to measure the piezoelectric effect,
   although no actual piezoelectric constants are calculated with this
   method. Results show that strain measurements of EPAM PVDF samples were
   up to 5.2 times greater than comparable measurements of PZT samples.
   However, the degree of piezoelectricity between EPAM PVDF samples varies
   so quality control is required for the EPAM process to ensure sample
   performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Additive Manufacturing technologies use different materials for
   producing of design parts. Most used technologies of additive
   manufacturing are Fused deposition modelling (FDM) which use plastic
   wires for deposition of parts layers. There are also others technologies
   which use for example resins, paper, plastic powder but also steel and
   producing of parts from metal powder. Also in plastic materials is wide
   range of polymers which are suitable for FDM technology. Conventional
   materials are ABS, PLA, Nylon, PETG and others polymers. There are also
   special composites where the base is conventional polymer and particles
   of other solid material as glass, metal, wood which give to produced
   parts specific properties or appearance. Very specific material is
   conductive material which can conduct the electrical current. Presented
   paper deals with using of conductive PLA filaments for part producing.
   There are described results from scientific experiments which are
   prepared by standard methods and evaluated by statistical methods.
   Measured are material properties and electrical resistance.},

Abstract = {This study evaluates the performance of continuous carbon, Kevlar and
   glass fibre reinforced composites manufactured using the fused
   deposition modelling (FDM) additive manufacturing technique. The fibre
   reinforced nylon composites were fabricated using a Markforged Mark One
   3D printing system. The mechanical performance of the composites was
   evaluated both in tension and flexure. The influence of fibre
   orientation, fibre type and volume fraction on mechanical properties
   were also investigated. The results were compared with that of both
   non-reinforced nylon control specimens, and known material property
   values from literature. It was demonstrated that of the fibres
   investigated, those fabricated using carbon fibre yielded the largest
   increase in mechanical strength per fibre volume. Its tensile strength
   values were up to 6.3 times higher than those obtained with the
   non-reinforced nylon polymer. As the carbon and glass fibre volume
   fraction increased so too did the level of air inclusion in the
   composite matrix, which impacted on mechanical performance. As a result,
   a maximum efficiency in tensile strength was observed in glass specimen
   as fibre content approached 22.5\%, with higher fibre contents (up to
   33\%), yielding only minor increases in strength. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {A review of the process physics and material screening methods for
   polymer powder bed fusion additive manufacturing},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN POLYMER SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {93},
Pages = {68-95},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Powder bed fusion (PBF) is one of seven different classes of additive
   manufacturing (AM) technologies identified by ASTM and ISO. In polymer
   PBF, an infra-red energy source selectively fuses powder particles
   layer-by-layer into a three-dimensional structure. This enables the
   production of parts without the use of a mold, which is useful for
   prototyping and low-volume production. The early research in polymer PBF
   has focused largely on exploring the expanded design space afforded by
   the technology and modeling the heat transfer during fabrication. These
   are aspects that emphasize the manufacturing process and resultant
   quality in a material agnostic manner. Early investigations into
   structure-process-property relationships focused on the industrially
   dominant polyamide family. Only recently has research been conducted
   towards expanding the PBF material portfolio beyond nylon-12 and its
   composites. Guiding this research is the knowledge gained from studying
   the behavior of polyamides in PBF, which resulted in pervasive
   guidelines for material screening and process parameter development in
   polymer PBF, including the concepts of a ``stable sintering region{''}
   and utilizing the ``energy melt ratio{''} to set machine parameters.
   However, these guidelines are largely empirical and disproportionately
   focus on process parameter effects on the mechanical properties of the
   printed parts, instead of the intrinsic polymer properties and first
   principles of polymer science and engineering.
   This review categorically compiles the PBF AM literature by the three
   process sub-functions: powder recoating, energy input, and coalescence
   and cooling. The literature outlining the governing physics,
   structure-property-processing relationships enabling printing, and the
   process-structure-property relationships enabling targeted final part
   properties are discussed within each sub-function. Establishing these
   polymer-manufacturing relationships, both for printability and for final
   part property prediction, is important to aid in the identification and
   adaptation of existing polymers, and development of novel polymers, for
   PBF AM. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Biodegradable stents offer the potential to improve long-term patency
   rates by providing support just long enough for the artery to heal.
   However, design a biodegradable structure for an intended period of
   support is rather difficult. Nowadays in the stent industry the
   manufacture process par excellence is the laser micro cutting.
   Nevertheless in the case of polymeric stents, the 3D additive
   manufacturing techniques could be a more economical solution.
   This work aim to design and implement a novel 3D Additive Manufacturing
   Machine to Biodegradable Stent Manufacture. The effects of nozzle
   temperature, fluid flow, and printing speed over the polycaprolactone
   stent's precision is studied. Results have shown the strong influence of
   temperature and flow rate over the printing precision. Printing speed
   did not had a clear tendency. The results allow us to believe that the
   novel technology presented in this paper will be an interesting future

   systematic review of techniques and properties},
Journal = {MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {36},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Polymers are one of the most commonly utilized materials in fabricating
   several components for various tenders. Several conventional techniques
   have been used to create polymer-based structures. Polymer matrix
   composites (PMCs) have recently been considered in additive
   manufacturing (AM). Also, the most remarkable progress in this field has
   been made in short fiber-reinforced composites, whereas continuous fiber
   fabricating residues is a very new area of study. Fused deposition
   modeling (FDM), fused filament fabrication (FFF), direct ink writing
   (DIW), and stereolithography (SLA) are examples of AM techniques that
   offer significant advantages over traditional techniques by enabling the
   creation of intricate PMC material sample geometries without the need
   for a mold. External forces such as outward, magnetic, electric,
   ultrasonic, or shear forces facilitate the convergence of AM processes
   with filler material arrangement methods. This convergence enables the
   precise geometric arrangement and positioning of continuous or
   intermittent fillers. Despite challenges in PMCs and process expansion,
   fresh design, modeling, and analysis techniques are desirable; These
   newly developed composite building types can effectively determine their
   best offers. The current review presents an overview of experiments and
   developments associated with AM of PMC materials from 2018 until now and
   provides a detailed discussion of current findings, challenges, and
   gaps.},

Abstract = {In the work presented herein, the structural integrity of polymeric
   functional components made of Nylon-645 and Polylactic acid (PLA)
   produced by additive manufacturing (Fused Deposition Modelling, FDM) is
   studied. The PLA component under study was selected from the production
   line of a brewing company, and it was redesigned and analyzed using the
   Finite Element Method, 3D printed, and installed under real service. The
   results obtained indicated that, even though the durability of the 3D
   printed part was lower than the original, savings of about EUR 7000 a
   year could be achieved for the component studied. Moreover, it was shown
   that widespread use of AM with other specific PLA components could
   result in even more significant savings. Additionally, a metallic hanger
   (2700 kg/m(3)) from the cockpit of an airplane ATR 70 series 500 was
   successfully redesigned and additively manufactured in Nylon 645,
   resulting in a mass reduction of approximately 60\% while maintaining
   its fit-for-purpose. Therefore, the components produced by FDM were used
   as fully functional components rather than prototype models, which is
   frequently stated as a major constraint of the FDM process.},

Abstract = {This article presents the results of monotonic tensile and fatigue tests
   conducted on commercial polylactide or polylactic acid (PLA). The
   results of fatigue tests for this material present in the literature are
   limited, especially for additive manufactured elements. The specimens
   were manufactured using the injection molding and the fused filament
   fabrication (FFF) method. The FFF specimens were divided into five
   subgroups, depending on the direction of filament deposition and infill
   density. The achieved results are aimed to verify the selected
   experimental method of fatigue testing of materials used in the additive
   manufacturing technology. It was considered an important issue, since
   there is no standard practice for fatigue testing of FFF- manufactured
   polymers, and research reported in the literature is usually obtained
   for a small number of specimens. In this work, over 20 specimens per S-N
   curve were used, which enables to classify them as reliability data type
   according to ASTM E 739 standard. It has been shown that the resultant
   fatigue lives can be related with applied nominal stress amplitudes
   using the classical S-N curve, described with Basquin-type power law
   function. This is evidenced, among the others, by the very similar
   scatter of results for both manufacturing technologies and the similar
   slopes of S-N curves. Some similar conclusions are hard to find in other
   works. The achieved results can also provide knowledge regarding the
   differences of monotonic and fatigue behavior of PLA, which is a
   commonly used biodegradable polymer, with respect to the technology of
   specimen's manufacturing method. They can be useful in the development
   of biodegradable implants and other devices used in tissue or biomedical
   engineering. It has been shown that, to some extent, the fatigue testing
   of FFF-manufactured parts can be performed in the similar way as parts
   manufactured by injection molding.},

Abstract = {In the last few years, utilizing fiber reinforced additive manufacturing
   (FRAM)-based components in several industries has become quite popular.
   Compared to conventional AM technologies, FRAM offered complementary
   solutions to their needs. In general, fibers have been traditionally
   used in many manufacturing processes for various reasons. However, using
   conventional methods, there are obstacles in obtaining the desired
   complex geometries and low setup costs. AM offers possible avoidance of
   these limitations. Shape complexity, infill density, and manufacturing
   lead times are no longer barriers. Bridging AM with fiber reinforced
   materials offers a vast opportunity for lightweight and strong parts.
   Depending on the affinity, fibers with different structures can be mixed
   with different matrix materials and, thus, create stronger parts with
   improved mechanical properties. Process parameters like raster angle,
   infill speed, layer thickness, and nozzle temperature also strongly
   impact physical properties of FRAM products and are considered
   carefully. FRAM-based components are used in many industries such as
   aerospace, motorsports, and biomedicine, where the weight, strength, and
   complexity of parts are critical. Hence, numerous industrial companies
   and research facilities are investigating the implementation and
   adaptation of FRAM to their requirements. Studies are generally
   conducted on new materials, new FRAM technologies, the effect of fiber
   orientations and fraction on the performance of parts, improving the
   printing parameters, and other subjects. This study reports the current
   trends and challenges that FRAM is bringing to AM ecosystem.},

Title = {A framework for forming thermoset polymer networks during laser powder
   bed fusion additive manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {72},
Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {It is commonly reported that the limited availability of material types
   is a major barrier to widespread adoption for polymer laser powder bed
   fusion (PBF/L) additive manufacturing (AM). A deeper understanding of
   the physico-chemical relationships between AM process stimuli and
   polymer responsive behavior is needed to make data-driven decisions for
   PBF/L specific material development and formulation. Many researchers
   have cumulatively built the current state of PBF/L ``science-based
   manufacturing{''}framework where an initial guess for process parameter
   values can be determined from measured polymer properties and the
   first-principles of physics. However, published literature has focused
   on developing this framework for thermoplastic processing of polymers
   omitting many specific concerns unique to processing thermosetting
   materials. The authors consider in the present work the implications of
   many specific aspects unique to thermosetting polymers during PBF/L
   manufacturing. These aspects are contextually discussed according to the
   five sub-functions of PBF/L and are described mathematically where
   appropriate alongside example data from thermosetting materials
   commercially available in powder form. This expansion of the prevailing
   material development framework to include thermosetting polymers paves
   the way for the unique performance properties offered by that class to
   be manifest through AM's geometric freedom.},

Abstract = {The simultaneous placement of different types of materials including
   polymers, ceramics, and metals, in their desired positions could be
   adopted to manufacture end-use devices/apparatuses with diverse
   functionalities and significantly reduce the fabrication cost and time.
   However, existing additive manufacturing (AM) approaches can only treat
   one material species at a time due to their intrinsic working
   mechanisms. Here we develop an AM manipulator for manufacturing a wide
   variety of material species, including polymers, ceramics, and metals,
   through a multifilament transport strategy assisted by laser power. The
   six-jaw manipulator contains three pairs of filament delivering/cutting
   systems for transporting diverse materials and a beam of tunable laser
   as the thermal source. The whole apparatus is integrated into a robotic
   manipulator to create a multifreedom manufacturing platform. With this
   innovation, products with multiple material species and desired complex
   geometries can be fabricated on demand. Furthermore, we synthesize a
   multimaterial (polymer/ceramic/metal) printed magnetoelectric pressure
   sensor that can convert applied mechanical forces to electricity and
   maintain efficiency even after undergoing 10000 cycles of
   pressure/recovery. With this multimaterial filament transport and laser
   manufacturing strategy, our AM manipulator exhibits promising
   application in the advanced manufacturing of embedded electronics,
   sensors, soft robotics, and customizable medical devices.},

Title = {Folding behavior of thermoplastic hinges fabricated with polymer

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {105},
Number = {1-4},
Pages = {233-245},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Due to the layer-by-layer nature of additive manufacturing, fabricated
   parts suffer from an anisotropic behavior with reduced mechanical
   performance when compared to traditional manufacturing. One specific
   mechanical property, folding endurance, requires both low flexural
   strength and simultaneously high elongation to achieve the flexibility
   needed to sustain repetitive bending. The present work provides an
   analysis of selected thermoplastics' flexural capacity, including nylon
   (PA), polyethylene terephthalate (PETG), polylactide (PLA),
   thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE),
   and a TPR blend (ABSMG94: SEBS-g-MA 25:75), in order to evaluate the
   maximum number of folding cycles and load capacity sustained by a living
   hinge. A fractographic analysis was performed using scanning electron
   microscopy and computed tomography. Similar to the performance of
   injected molded products, the experimental results demonstrated that
   three of the tested materials behaved well in the context of a large
   number of folding cycles prior to an eventual detachment into two
   pieces; TPR blend, 244,424 cycles; PP endured one million cycles; and
   TPU, more than two million cycles, while the remaining materials failed
   to survive more than 1000 cycles. The hinges failure analysis revealed a
   wide variety of fracture morphologies and failure modes. In regard to
   the load capacity, PLA, PETG, and nylon provided the highest results in
   the ultimate strength of an axial static force applied (790.61 N, 656.06
   N, and 652.75 N respectively), while the TPR blend was the highest
   (398.44 N) of the elastomeric materials (PP, TPU, and TPR blend). The
   evaluated materials demonstrated enough flexibility for use in specific
   applications such as stretchable electronics and wearable applications.},

Title = {Effect of Moisture on Shape Memory Polyurethane Polymers for
   Extrusion-Based Additive Manufacturing},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Extrusion-based additive manufacturing (EBAM) or 3D printing is used to
   produce customized prototyped parts. The majority of the polymers used
   with EBAM show moisture sensitivity. However, moisture effects become
   more pronounced in polymers used for critical applications, such as
   biomedical stents, sensors, and actuators. The effects of moisture on
   the manufacturing process and the long-term performance of Shape Memory
   Polyurethane (SMPU) have not been fully investigated in the literature.
   This study focuses primarily on block-copolymer SMPUs that have two
   different hard/soft (h/s) segment ratios. It investigates the effect of
   moisture on the various properties via studying: (i) the effect of
   moisture trapping within these polymers and the consequences when
   manufacturing; (ii) and the effect on end product performance of
   plasticization by moisture. Results indicate that higher h/s SMPU shows
   higher microphase separation, which leads to an increase of moisture
   trapping within the polymer. Understanding moisture trapping is critical
   for EBAM parts due to an increase in void content and a decrease in
   printing quality. The results also indicate a stronger plasticizing
   effect on polymers with lower h/s ratio but with a more forgiving
   printing behavior compared to the higher h/s ratio.},

   short carbon fibers to the polymer feedstock. The addition of short
   carbon fibers improves both the mechanical and thermal properties of the
   printed beads. The improvements to the anisotropic mechanical and
   thermal properties of the polymer feedstock are dependent on the
   spatially varying orientation of short carbon fibers which is itself a
   function of the velocity gradients in the flow field throughout the
   nozzle and in the extrudate during deposition flow. This paper presents
   a computational approach for simulating the deposition flow that occurs
   in the Large Area Additive Manufacturing (LAAM) process and the effects
   on the final short fiber orientation state in the deposited polymer bead
   and the resulting bead mechanical and thermal properties. The finite
   element method is used to evaluate Stokes flow for a two-dimensional
   planar flow field within a Strangpresse Model 19 LAAM polymer deposition
   nozzle. A shape optimization method is employed to compute the shape of
   the polymer melt flow free surface below the nozzle exit as the bead is
   deposited on a moving print platform. Three nozzle configurations are
   considered in this study. Fiber orientation tensors are calculated
   throughout the fluid domain using the Folgar-Tucker fiber interaction
   model. The effective bulk mechanical properties, specifically the
   longitudinal and transverse moduli, and the coefficient of thermal
   expansion, are also calculated for the deposited bead based on the
   spatially varying fiber orientation tensors. Fiber orientation is found
   to be highly aligned along the deposition direction of the resulting
   bead and the computed properties through the thickness of the bead are
   found to be affected by nozzle height during deposition.},

   testing direction and environment during cyclic loading},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {118},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Although biodegradable polymers were widely researched, this is the
   first study considering the effect of combined testing environments and
   cyclic loading on the most important aspect related to additive
   manufacturing: the interfacial bond between deposited layers. Its
   results give confidence in applicability of the material extrusion
   additive manufacturing technology for biomedical fields, by
   demonstrating that the interface behaves in a manner similar to that of
   the bulk-polymer material. To do this, especially designed tensile
   specimens were used to analyse the degradation of 3D-printed polymers
   subjected to constant-amplitude and incremental cyclic loads when tested
   in air at room temperature (control) and submerged at 37 ?C (close to
   in-vivo conditions). The mechanical properties of the interface between
   extruded filaments were compared against the bulk material, i.e. along
   filaments. In both cases, cyclic loading caused only a negligible
   detrimental effect compared to non-cyclic loading (less than 10 \%
   difference in ultimate tensile strength), demonstrating the suitability
   of using 3D-printed components in biomedical applications, usually
   exposed to cyclic loading. For cyclic tests with a constant loading
   amplitude, larger residual deformation (>100 \% greater) and energy
   dissipation (>15 \% greater) were found when testing submerged in
   solution at 37 ?C as opposed to in laboratory conditions (air at room
   temperature), as used by many studies. This difference may be due to
   plasticisation effects of water and temperature. For cyclic tests with
   incrementally increasing loading amplitudes, the vast majority of energy
   dissipation happened in the last two cycles prior to failure, when the
   polymer approached the yield point. The results demonstrate the
   importance of using an appropriate methodology for biomedical
   applications; otherwise, mechanical properties may be overestimated.},

Title = {Polymeric drug delivery systems by additive manufacturing},
Journal = {ADVANCED DRUG DELIVERY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {173},
Pages = {349-373},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is gaining interests in drug delivery
   applications, offering innovative opportunities for the design and
   development of systems with complex geometry and programmed controlled
   release profile. In addition, polymer-based drug delivery systems can
   improve drug safety, efficacy, patient compliance, and are the key
   materials in AM. Therefore, combining AM and polymers can be beneficial
   to overcome the existing limitations in the development of controlled
   release drug delivery systems. Considering these advantages, here we are
   focusing on the recent developments in the field of polymeric drug
   delivery systems prepared by AM. This review provides a comprehensive
   overview on a holistic polymer-AM perspective for drug delivery systems
   with discussion on the materials, properties, design and fabrication
   techniques and the mechanisms used to achieve a controlled release
   system. The current challenges and future perspectives for personalized
   medicine and clinical use of these systems are also briefly discussed.

Title = {Additive Manufacturing of Polymer-Based Lubrication},
Journal = {MACROMOLECULAR MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 1},
Abstract = {The fast growth of 3D printing technology gives designers many ways to
   make structures that are hard to see. 3D printing lets you customize
   complex structures in any way you want and make rapid prototypes of
   materials. It enables you to simulate things more effectively. So far,
   experiments with polymer-based lubrication have been done on atomically
   smooth surfaces, under dynamic conditions, and on the nano- or
   micro-scale. Polymer-based lubrication in 3D printing has been studied
   in depth, which has made it possible to make significant,
   multifunctional 3D structures with microscale accuracy. It is a crucial
   way to approach lubrication and has sparked much scientific interest. A
   thorough literature review is done to keep track of the latest advances
   in 3D printing for structural polymer-based lubrication simulation. The
   design and lubrication performance quality of bio-inspired,
   different-sized simulation structures is given much attention. The
   material requirements, skills, and representative applications of
   various 3D printing technologies are summarized. The efficient
   directions for future research in designing and making 3D-printed
   lubrication structures are also pointed out.},

Abstract = {Fused Deposition Modeling with Polypropylene filament was employed to
   make a lap joint between Polypropylene and pre-punched Al-Mg alloy
   sheets, in the form of bonds between the polymeric substrate and the

   base sheet. Effects of the joint interface area (hole diameter of 5-13
   mm) and preheating of the substrates (room temperature, 50 and 90
   degrees C) were investigated on the mechanical properties of the joints.
   Peak load in the tensile-shear and cross-tension tests increased with
   enhancement of the joint interface area (up to (similar to)280 N and
   (similar to)160 N, respectively). Higher joint strength in the
   tensile-shear test compared to the cross-tension test was discussed at
   the light of the failure locations in the tests. Preheating of the
   substrates increased the joint strength via improvement in the bonds
   between the polymer sheet and the additive part and increase in the
   adhesion force between the printed layers.},

Abstract = {Extrusion based high-throughput Additive Manufacturing (AM) provides a
   rapid and versatile approach for producing complex structures by using a

   is concerned with the formation of interfaces between successively
   deposited layers. This is particularly important for large-scale
   additive manufacturing of semi-crystalline polymers because of the
   highly non-isothermal conditions involved, which influence both
   nucleation and crystal growth. The objective of this work is to
   investigate the microstructure and the corresponding viscoelastic
   properties of carbon fiber (CF) reinforced polyphenylene sulfide (PPS)
   resulting from extrusion-based high-throughput AM process. Questions on
   development of morphology focus on polymer crystal structure and carbon
   fiber orientation in the vicinity of the interface between successive
   layers. This study attempts to establish a fundamental understanding of
   the role of the AM has in transferring a set of intrinsic material
   properties to the macroscopic properties of the final AM structure.},

Title = {Additive micro-manufacturing of crack-free PDCs by two-photon
   polymerization of a single, low-shrinkage preceramic resin},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) methods are being integrated in ceramics
   fabrication either as the main manufacturing tool or for auxiliary
   purposes. By using polymers, powders and preceramic formulated
   materials, AM techniques are pushing towards higher resolution, lower
   shrinkage and shorter building time. Herein, we present the fabrication
   of ceramic microstructures (< 200 x 200 x 200 mu m(3)) with
   sub-micrometer resolution based on two-photon polymerization (TPP). 3D
   structuring of a preceramic resin by photopolymerization produces a
   so-called green body. The final ceramic part is obtained after pyrolysis
   of the green body. The high-resolution 3D shaped structures that we
   demonstrated could be employed as tools or components for microdevices.
   We report a lower linear shrinkage of 30\% of TPP green bodies from a
   polysiloxane precursor with low porosity, no cracks and no significant
   shape distortion after pyrolysis, which implies the potential for highly
   controllable manufacturing of micro-ceramic parts based on commercially
   available chemical compounds. The protocol for preparing, fabricating
   and developing the resin is detailed.},

Title = {Additive manufacture of ionic polymer-metal composite actuators using

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to develop a additive manufacturing
   (AM) process for the fabrication of ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC)
   devices with complex designs that would be time-consuming to replicate
   using conventional manual methods. These IPMC devices have considerable
   potential in electroactive polymers (EAPs) and soft actuators.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a novel
   three-dimensional (3D) AM technique to develop IPMCs. Digital light
   processing (DLP) fabrication of soft EAPs was undertaken using a
   vat-based AM method, followed by deposition of cost-effective outer
   silver electrodes. Findings DLP-fabricated devices were compared to
   conventional Nafion (TM)-117 devices. DLP layer-by-layer fabrication of
   these devices allowed for good resolution for a range of printed
   objects. Electrical actuation of the DLP-produced IPMCs showed tip
   displacements of up to 3 mm, and greater actuation was seen in the
   presence of lithium rather than magnesium cations. The IMPCs showed good
   ion exchange capacities, while electrochemical analysis showed the
   reversible formation and removal of AgCl layers in addition to ion
   movement. Practical implications The AM of these devices allows for
   rapid prototyping as well as potential use in the development of
   multiple degrees of freedom actuators and devices. Originality/value An
   original resin formulation was developed for DLP 3D printing. This
   formula is chemically distinct from the conventional Nafion (TM)-117
   membranes that can be purchased. Additionally, this method allows for
   the manufacture of complex objects that would be difficult to machine by
   hand. These findings are of value to both the fields of polymer
   chemistry and AM.},

Number = {38-39, SI},
Pages = {2153-2159},
Abstract = {Spin coating and drop casting are viable methods for rapid and low-cost
   additive manufacturing of components for flexible devices and sensors.
   We investigated the cumulative effects of layering a conductive polymer
   composite 2 wt\% MWCNT filler in PEDOT:PSS on a Mylar substrate for
   application to electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding. The optical
   transmittace of spin coated composite layers is 90\%, 45\%, and 20\%
   with a thickness of 0.05 mu m, 0.15 mu m, and 0.45 mu m respectively.
   Drop cast composite layers have 0\% transmittance due to their much
   greater starting thickness of 4.4 mu m. The addition of isopropyl
   alcohol (IPA) to the solution mixture and substrate heating to 40
   degrees C improves the conductivity, and drying time of the cured
   composite layers to 10 min. This study shows that the cumulative effects
   of composite layering are additive, but the electrical properties do not
   scale the same way. A significant increase in the EMI SE is mainly
   attributed to the enhanced electrical conductivity of the composite. The
   insertion of a 50 mu m gap in between two 15 mu m composite layers
   accentuates the EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) significantly to a peak
   of 21 dB within a narrow frequency range in the Ku-band tested.},

Abstract = {Manufacturing tooling for injection molding has traditionally been
   associated with high cost and long lead times, due to the complex
   geometry and demanding machining requirements. This has caused injection
   molding to be limited to large-volume production, as the tooling needs
   to amortize over large volumes to achieve a low unit cost. Additive
   Manufacturing (AM) technologies enables a high degree of complexity at a
   low cost, which enables cost-efficient manufacturing of the geometries
   required for injection molding tooling. Using AM tooling for
   thermoplastics injection molding presents a challenge, as it requires
   high pressures and temperatures, which destroy the tooling after only a
   few shots. Hence, this study focuses on investigating the use of softer
   polymer tooling with Reaction Injection Molding (RIM), which requires
   lower temperatures and pressures than those of thermoplastics injection
   molding. A case study has been performed to assess both the cost
   implications and how the use of AM tooling for RIM affects
   organizational agility.},

Abstract = {This contribution focuses on the experimental investigation and material
   modelling of the crosslinking of UV curing polymers used in additive
   manufacturing processes such as digital light processing and
   stereolithography. First photocalorimetric measurements with varying
   temperature and light intensity are shown. From the exothermic specific
   heat flows measured during the crosslinking reaction, the degree of cure
   can be determined for each experimental scenario. It is shown that the
   test temperature and light intensity have a significant influence on the
   crosslinking reaction.
   A first modelling approach for the mathematical description of the
   crosslinking reaction is presented. Moreover, parameter identification
   of the proposed model is conducted using the commercial optimisation
   program LS-OPT (R).},

Abstract = {In this paper, an additive manufacturing process, named Magnetic
   Field-assisted Projection Stereolithography (M-PSL), is presented for
   applications such as fabricating magnetic field responsive smart polymer
   composites. The 3D printed magnetic field-responsive smart polymer
   composite creates a wide range of motions, opening up possibilities for
   various new applications, like sensing and actuation in soft robotics,
   biomedical devices, and autonomous systems. In M-PSL process, a certain
   amount of nano- or micro-scale ferromagnetic particles is deposited into
   resin vat with a programmable micro deposition nozzle. Then a magnetic
   field is applied to direct the magnetic particles to the desired area.
   After that, digital mask images are used to cure particles in
   photopolymer with certain patterns. Important issues like magnetic
   particle movements, curing mechanisms, and manufacturing process
   planning are discussed. Two test cases, an impeller and a two-wheel
   roller, have been successfully fabricated for remote control under
   external magnetic field, showing the capability of printed smart polymer
   composites on performing desired functions.},

Title = {Modeling Materials Coextrusion in Polymers Additive Manufacturing},

Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Material extrusion additive manufacturing enables us to combine more
   materials in the same nozzle during the deposition process. This
   technology, called material coextrusion, generates an expanded range of
   material properties, which can gradually change in the design domain,
   ensuring blending or higher bonding/interlocking among the different
   materials. To exploit the opportunities offered by these technologies,
   it is necessary to know the behavior of the combined materials according
   to the materials fractions. In this work, two compatible pairs of
   materials, namely Polylactic Acid (PLA)-Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU)
   and Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate (ASA)-TPU, were investigated by
   changing the material fractions in the coextrusion process. An original
   model describing the distribution of the materials is proposed. Based on
   this, the mechanical properties were investigated by analytical and
   numerical approaches. The analytical model was developed on the
   simplified assumption that the coextruded materials are a set of rods,
   whereas the more realistic numerical model is based on homogenization
   theory, adopting the finite element analysis of a representative volume
   element. To verify the deposition model, a specific experimental test
   was developed, and the modeled material deposition was superimposed and
   qualitatively compared with the actual microscope images regarding the
   different deposition directions and material fractions. The analytical
   and numerical models show similar trends, and it can be assumed that the
   finite element model has a more realistic behavior due to the higher
   accuracy of the model description. The elastic moduli obtained by the
   models was verified in experimental tensile tests. The tensile tests
   show Young's moduli of 3425 MPa for PLA, 1812 MPa for ASA, and 162 MPa
   for TPU. At the intermediate material fraction, the Young's modulus
   shows an almost linear trend between PLA and TPU and between ASA and
   TPU. The ultimate tensile strength values are 63.9 MPa for PLA, 35.7 MPa
   for ASA, and 63.5 MPa for TPU, whereas at the intermediate material
   fraction, they assume lower values. In this initial work, the results
   show a good agreement between models and experiments, providing useful
   tools for designers and contributing to a new branch in additive
   manufacturing research.},

Abstract = {Material extrusion additive manufacturing of thermoplastic composites
   have been used for rapid prototyping of tools or molds that are then
   used for production of structural composite parts via conventional
   manufacturing methods. The process utilizes short fiber reinforced
   polymer pellets, which allows for the printed mold to remain rigid
   throughout the final composite part fabrication process as well as
   retain some integrity. Composite parts manufactured using printed molds
   are usually accomplished at elevated temperatures, and high-temperature
   composite feedstock that are commercially available has enabled this
   type of application. However, mechanical data of printed parts is often
   limited to certain deformation modes and elevated temperature behavior
   is usually not reported in the literature. This work characterizes and
   discusses the mechanical behavior of a short fiber reinforced
   polyethersulfone and includes the influence of elevated temperature.
   Tension, compression, and shear deformations were analyzed using digital
   image correlation, which captured the surface strain fields for each
   temperature condition. The results show that stiffness generally
   decreases with temperature; however, certain shear deformation modes do
   not necessarily follow this trend. Moreover, specimens loaded under
   tension exhibit brittle-like behavior at elevated temperatures. These
   results are useful for designing printed composites using material
   extrusion additive manufacturing to account for changes in behavior
   under elevated temperature environments.},

Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM, also known as 3D printing) is an advanced
   manufacturing technique that has enabled progress in the design and
   fabrication of customised or patient-specific (meta-)biomaterials and
   biomedical devices (e.g., implants, prosthetics, and orthotics) with
   complex internal microstructures and tuneable properties. In the past
   few decades, several design guidelines have been proposed for creating
   porous lattice structures, particularly for biomedical applications.
   Meanwhile, the capabilities of AM to fabricate a wide range of
   biomaterials, including metals and their alloys, polymers, and ceramics,
   have been exploited, offering unprecedented benefits to medical
   professionals and patients alike. In this review article, we provide an
   overview of the design principles that have been developed and used for
   the AM of biomaterials as well as those dealing with three major
   categories of biomaterials, i.e., metals (and their alloys), polymers,
   and ceramics. The design strategies can be categorised as: library-based
   design, topology optimisation, bio-inspired design, and
   meta-biomaterials. Recent developments related to the biomedical
   applications and fabrication methods of AM aimed at enhancing the
   quality of final 3D-printed biomaterials and improving their physical,
   mechanical, and biological characteristics are also highlighted.
   Finally, examples of 3D-printed biomaterials with tuned properties and
   functionalities are presented.},

Title = {Extrusion Additive Manufacturing of PEI Pellets},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING AND MATERIALS PROCESSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {6},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The simplest, most cost-efficient, and most widespread Additive
   Manufacturing (AM) technology is Extrusion Additive Manufacturing (EAM).
   Usually, EAM is performed with filament feedstock, but using pellets
   instead of filaments yields many benefits, including significantly lower
   cost and a wider choice of materials. High-performance polymers offer
   high strength even when produced with AM technique, allowing to produce
   near-net-shape functional parts. The production of these materials in
   filament form is still limited and expensive; therefore, in this paper,
   the possibility of producing AM components with engineering polymers
   from pellets will be thoroughly investigated. In this work, the
   effectiveness of a specially designed AM machine for printing
   high-performance materials in pellet form was tested. The material
   chosen for the investigation is PEI 1000 which offers outstanding
   mechanical and thermal properties, giving the possibility to produce
   with EAM functional components. Sensitivity analyses have been carried
   out to define a process window in terms of thermal process parameters by
   observing different response variables. Using the process parameters in
   the specified range, the additive manufactured material has been
   mechanically tested, and its microstructure has been investigated, both
   in dried and undried conditions. Finally, a rapid tool for sheet metal
   forming has been produced.},

Abstract = {The popular applications of Additive Manufactured (AM) polymer materials
   in engineering, medical, and industrial fields have been widely
   recognized due to their high-speed production despite their complex
   design shapes. Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is the technique that has
   become the most renowned AM process due to its simplicity and because it
   is the cheapest method. The main objective of this research is to
   perform a numerical simulation of the thermo-mechanical behaviour of AM
   polymer with continuous carbon fibre reinforcement exposed to elevated
   temperatures. The influence of global thermal loads on AM material was
   focused on mechanical property changes at the microscale (level of
   fiber-matrix interaction). The mechanical response (strain/stress
   distribution) of the AM material on the temperature loading was modelled
   using the finite element method (FEM). The coupled thermal-displacement
   analysis was used during the numerical calculations. The strain in the
   sample due to its exposition on elevated temperature was measured using
   fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. The numerical results were compared
   with the experimental results achieved for the sample exposure to the
   same thermal conditions showing good agreement. A strong influence of
   the temperature on the matrix structure and the condition of bondings
   between fibres and matrix was observed.},

Title = {Analysis of General and Specific Standardization Developments in
   Additive Manufacturing From a Materials and Technological Approach},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {125056-125075},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing processes and products are very present in the
   current productive landscape, and in fact these technologies have been
   one of the most intensively studied and improved during the last years;
   however, there is still no defined and homogeneous regulatory context
   for this field. In this work, a thorough review of the main general and
   specific regulatory developments in design, materials and processes
   standards for additive manufacturing has been carried out, with special
   attention to the standards for mechanical characterization of
   polymer-based products. In many cases standards developed for other
   productive contexts are identified as recommended references, and some
   contradictory trends can be identified when different documents and
   previous experiences are consulted. Thus, as it is logical considering
   that all these technologies are involved in an intensive and continuous
   evolution process, there is a certain lack of clarity regarding the
   standards to be considered. This work aims to contribute to clarify the
   current standardization context in additive manufacturing and provide
   some guidelines for the identification of appropriate standards. The
   paper also emphasizes that the key for next regulatory developments in
   mechanical testing is to develop standards that consider particular AM
   processes along with materials. Moreover, a great gap between available
   standard about additive technologies based on metallic materials and
   polymer materials during the last years has been detected. Finally, the
   provided overview is considered of interest as support for research and
   practice in additive manufacturing, and both in intensive productive
   scenarios and for particular users and makers.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing techniques offer the potential to fabricate
   organized tissue constructs to repair or replace damaged or diseased
   human tissues and organs. Using these techniques, spatial variations of
   cells along multiple axes with high geometric complexity in combination
   with different biomaterials can be generated. The level of control
   offered by these computer-controlled technologies to design and
   fabricate tissues will accelerate our understanding of the governing
   factors of tissue formation and function. Moreover, it will provide a
   valuable tool to study the effect of anatomy on graft performance. In
   this review, we discuss the rationale for engineering tissues and organs
   by combining computer-aided design with additive manufacturing
   technologies that encompass the simultaneous deposition of cells and
   materials. Current strategies are presented, particularly with respect
   to limitations due to the lack of suitable polymers, and requirements to
   move the current concepts to practical application. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Title = {Polymers for conventional, subtractive, and additive manufacturing of

Abstract = {Objectives. To investigate the wear resistance of polymers for injection
   molding, subtractive and additive manufacturing of occlusal devices in
   comparison with enamel antagonist wear and material properties (i.e.,
   hardness, flexural strength, and flexural modulus).
   Methods. Injection molding was compared with milling and the additive
   technologies stereolithography, low force stereolithography, and digital
   light processing. For each material, eight specimens were produced for
   wear measurements. Extracted human premolars served as indenters. All
   samples were subjected to two series of a 2-body wear test consisting of
   200,000 circular loading cycles with an applied load of 1) 20 N and 2)
   50 N in a thermocy-cling environment (5/55 degrees C, 30 s, 3860 cycles,
   H2O). Wear resistance was characterized by means of maximum depth and
   volume of the resulting traces. In addition, enamel wear of the
   indenters and Vickers hardness, flexural strength, and flexural modulus
   of the polymers were determined. Wear was statistically analyzed with
   linear general models for repeated measures and material properties with
   one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey-HSD tests.
   Results. Wear of the antagonists was not influenced by the material (P
   >= 0.343). Likewise, no differences in wear resistance were found
   between materials after cyclic loading with 20 N or 50 N (P >= 0.074).
   Material properties investigated revealed decreased values for the
   resins for the additive manufacturing with the exception of flexural
   strength of one material.
   Significance. Within the limitations of this in-vitro study, arylates
   for conventional, subtractive, and additive manufacturing of occlusal
   devices differ in material properties but not in wear resistance and
   antagonist wear. (C) 2020 The Academy of Dental Materials. Published by

Abstract = {In this paper, studies on the tensile strength, fracture initiation and
   propagation behaviour of composite material layered shell structures
   manufactured by extrusion based additive manufacturing (AM) is reported.
   To understand the basic mechanical behaviour, simple tension tests have
   been conducted on ASTM-D638 specimens of carbon fiber and natural fiber
   reinforced polymer matrix composites made by AM in different modes as
   well as directly in filament form using a filament extruder. The tensile
   strengths reveal that the internal defects unique to additive
   manufacturing, such as lack of fusion (LOF) sites and voids, play
   crucial role in the macroscopic fracture. Based on the tensile test
   results, finite element analysis of shell structures typical of
   below-knee prosthetic sockets has been conducted to preSelection and
   peer-review under responsibility of the scientific committee of the 2nd
   International Conference on Recent Advances in Materials \&
   Manufacturing Technologies.dict the fracture initiation sites and
   propagation paths. The analysis results have shown close correlation
   with the experimental observation of the fracture phenomenon in the
   prosthetic sockets given to pilot test amputees. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {47},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The dynamic behaviors of short fiber/polymer composite powders in powder
   paving process of additive manufacturing are investigated by discrete
   element method simulations. Two typical forms of powder paving,
   counter-rolling and scraping, are performed with mixed carbon
   fibers/polyamide12 powders. It is found that the compaction of the mixed
   powders in the counter-rolling form powder paving is stronger than that
   in the scraping form. With the same paving speed and layer thickness,
   the powder layer obtained from the counter-rolling form powder paving is
   denser. For both forms of powder paving, the powder layer density
   decreases with the increasing of the paving speed. Finally, the increase
   of the fiber length will reduce the spreadability of the mixed powders,
   and hence decreases the packing density of the powder layer. The
   negative effect of the fiber length is relatively weak in the
   counter-rolling form powder paving due to the compaction of the roller.},

   properties of polycarbonate (PC) composites was investigated. In the
   first part of the work, the polymer and its composites containing 0.5-3
   wt.\% filler were used to obtain a filament using the proprietary
   technological line. The moldings for testing functional properties were
   obtained with the use of 3D printing and injection molding techniques.
   In the next part of the work, the rheological properties-mass flow rate
   (MFR) and mechanical properties-Rockwell hardness, Charpy impact
   strength and static tensile strength with Young's modulus were examined.
   The structure of the obtained composites was also described and
   determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The porosity,
   roughness and dimensional stability of samples obtained by 3D printing
   were also determined. On the other hand, the physicochemical properties
   were presented on the basis of the research results using
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC), wide angle X-ray scattering analysis (WAXS) and Fourier Transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Additionally, the electrical conductivity
   of the obtained composites was investigated. On the basis of the
   obtained results, it was found that both the amount and the type of
   filler significantly affected the functional properties of the
   composites tested in the study.},

Title = {Multiphysics modeling of frontal polymerization-assisted layer-by-layer
   additive manufacturing of thermoset polymer components},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {59},
Number = {B},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Frontal polymerization (FP) is a novel curing strategy that relies on a
   self-propagating exothermic reaction front to polymerize thermoset
   resins rapidly. Due to its energy-efficiency and rapid curing of
   thermosets, a series of applications related to polymer and polymer
   composite manufacturing have been developed based on FP, in particular
   additive manufacturing (AM). While the current research demonstrates
   successful printing of 1D, 2D and 3D structures based on FP, a key
   challenge is the determination of the printing parameters through
   trial-and-error, which hinders its large-scale application. To better
   understand how different process parameters affect the front behavior
   and the printing process, and eventually enable fast printing of complex
   parts without trial-and-error, computational modeling of the printing
   process is highly desired. For the first time, we develop a
   mul-tiphysics finite element model for simulating FP-assisted AM which
   accounts for both the thermal-chemical process and the ink deposition in
   a real printing process. To simulate the dynamic ink deposition process,
   element activation is used that constantly adds elements to the
   simulation domain following a predefined printing path and velocity. A
   coupled thermo-chemical partial differential equation system is solved
   over the changing ink domain to simulate the heat transfer and chemical
   reaction during the printing process. The model is first validated by
   comparing the front temperature history during the printing process with
   the experimental infrared thermal measurements. The validated model
   enables the determination of proper printing velocity range, within
   which the polymerization front can follow the printing such that the ink
   will not deform before curing, which is critical to ensure printing
   accuracy. Furthermore, the simulation reveals the change of front
   temperature and degree of cure between different layers, and their
   dependency on layer length and printing velocity, providing insights
   into the printing experiments for processing parameters selection.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Ceramics are highly chemically, thermally, and mechanically resistant.
   These remarkable propertiers make them useful across multiple
   industries; but also, difficult to mold into complex shapes. A
   possibility to make convoluted ceramic parts is to use preceramic
   polymers (PCPs) in liquid form. The PCP resin is first solidified in a
   desired geometry and then transformed into ceramic compounds through a
   pyrolysis step that preserves the shape. Light-based additive
   manufacturing (AM) is a promising route to achieve solidification of the
   PCP resin. Different approaches, such as stereolithography, have already
   been proposed but they all rely on a layer-by-layer printing process
   which limits printing speed and object geometry. Herein, the fabrication
   of complex 3D centimeter-scale ceramic parts by using tomographic
   volumetric printing is presented, which is fast and offers a
   high-resolution and geometrical design freedom. First, a photosensitive
   polysiloxane preceramic resin that is solidified by projecting light
   patterns from multiple angles is formulated. Then, the obtained 3D
   printed parts are converted into ceramics by pyrolysis. The strength of
   this approach is demonstrated through the fabrication of smooth, dense
   microcomponents exhibiting overhangs and hollow geometries without the
   need of supporting structures. Their resistance to thermal stress and
   harsh chemical treatments is characterized.},

Abstract = {Direct additive manufacturing (AM) of sensors has in recent years become
   possible, but still remains a largely unexplored area. This work
   proposes a novel resistive sensor design that utilizes the geometric
   freedom offered by AM, especially by material extrusion, to enable a
   customizable and amplified response to force and deformation. This is
   achieved by using a multi-material design made of an elastomer and an
   electrically conductive polymer that enables a physical shortening of
   the conductive path under compressive load through a specific definition
   of shape. A number of different variants of this novel sensor design are
   tested, measuring their mechanical and electrical behavior under
   compression. The results of these tests confirm a strong resistive
   response to mechanical loading. Furthermore, the results provide insight
   into the influencing factors of the design, i.e., the gap size between
   the conductive pathing and the stiffness of the sense element support
   structure are found to be primary influencing factors governing sensor
   behavior.},

Journal = {COMPOSITES COMMUNICATIONS},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing could be an excellent way of shaping
   magnetocaloric heat exchangers in magnetic re-frigerators. However, the
   metal additive manufacturing techniques present the serious limitation
   that the melting of a magnetocaloric material can cause its
   transformation and the loss of functionality. Fused deposition modeling
   using polymer-based composite filaments is presented as a promising
   alternative as temperatures are low enough to preserve the
   magnetocaloric material. To prove this claim, a polymer-based composite
   filament containing 55 wt\% of (La,Ce)(Fe,Mn,Si)13-H magnetocaloric
   fillers has been manufactured using custom-made polymer capsules as the
   feedstock for the extrusion. Both adiabatic temperature change and
   isothermal en-tropy change have been characterized for the fillers,
   as-prepared filaments and as-printed parts, indicating that the
   magnetocaloric material functionality is not altered along the whole
   process. Printing resolution is compa-rable to the raw PLA filament.},

Abstract = {In additive manufacturing, PowderBed Fusion (PBF) has been shown to be a
   highly reliable approach for pro-totyping of metal parts, but has
   several disadvantages: relative slow production time, inherent safety
   issues involved with using loose metal powders, and difficulty in
   printing multi-material parts. A novel method for additive manufacturing
   of metal parts, Metal Additive manufacturing using Powder Sheets (MAPS),
   is hereby described. MAPS uses rollers of a novel composite material as
   feedstock, which eliminates the need for loose powder in the build
   chamber, potentially reducing risks and enhancing applications while
   still producing material on par with that produced by established PBF

Abstract = {In order to use selective laser sintering to manufacture structural
   parts for automotive and aerospace applications, the failure conditions
   of such a component must be understood and predicted. A 3D failure
   criterion for anisotropic materials that incorporates stress
   interactions is implemented to predict failure of selective laser
   sintered parts manufactured using polyamide 12 powder. Special test
   specimens that capture tensile, compressive and shear strengths, as
   single or combined loads, were designed, manufactured and tested.
   Results show that significant differences exist between tensile and
   compressive strengths, and that failure of additive manufactured parts
   is strongly influenced by the interaction between stresses. The test
   data shows an excellent fit with a tensor based failure criterion that
   includes interaction strength tensor components, thus being able to
   capture the strength behavior of SLS printed components under complex
   loading conditions. The study also demonstrated that work is still
   required to allow incorporation of some important stress interactions
   present in those complex stress fields.},

Abstract = {Various types of additive manufacturing (AM) methods (also called 3D
   printing), and materials have been increasingly studied in the field of
   additive manufacturing of flexible structures such as fabrics, and
   flexible electronics. Polymer-based AM processes allow the flexibility,
   rapid, and low-cost fabrication of complex geometries depending on the
   types of materials used. The purpose of this review article is to
   summarize the major AM methods, materials, and their emerging
   applications to additively manufacture the flexible structures. In the
   AM methods section, Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), and Selective Laser
   Sintering (SLS) are reviewed for fabrics, and Direct Ink Writing (DIW)
   for electronics. In the Materials section, the manufacturing methods,
   chemical structures, properties, advantages, and limitations of some of
   the widely used materials in three-dimensional (3D) printing of polymers
   are reviewed. Third, the applications of these methods and materials for
   fabrics, and electronics are covered. Finally, the associated
   opportunities and challenges in 3D printing process of flexible
   structures are described. The future research should be related to the
   exploration of combinations and development of innovative materials,
   printing process parameters, detail study on improving the properties,

   devices are not well studied. This paper addresses much needed
   sustainability aspects of additive manufacturing processes. More
   specifically, material wastage and energy consumption are two major
   concerns of the AM processes that requires immediate attention. In this
   research, process both at layer and part level enabling additive
   manufacturing process towards sustainability is formulated and
   optimized. Numerous real world examples are demonstrated and compared
   against conventional approaches to demonstrate the applicability of the
   developed approach. The models formulated here for selective laser

Abstract = {Digitization and automation are essential tools to increase productivity
   and close significant added-value deficits in the building industry.
   Additive manufacturing (AM) is a process that promises to impact all
   aspects of building construction profoundly. Of special interest in AM
   is an in-depth understanding of material systems based on their
   isotropic or anisotropic properties. The presented research focuses on
   fiber-reinforced polymers, with anisotropic mechanical properties
   ideally suited for AM applications that include tailored structural
   reinforcement. This article presents a cyber-physical manufacturing
   process that enhances existing robotic coreless Filament Winding (FW)
   methods for glass and carbon fiber-reinforced polymers. Our main
   contribution is the complete characterization of a feedback-based,
   sensor-informed application for process monitoring and fabrication data
   acquisition and analysis. The proposed AM method is verified through the
   fabrication of a large-scale demonstrator. The main finding is that
   implementing AM in construction through cyber-physical robotic coreless
   FW leads to more autonomous prefabrication processes and unlocks
   upscaling potential. Overall, we conclude that material-system-aware
   communication and control are essential for the efficient automation and
   design of fiber-reinforced polymers in future construction.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM)/3D printing (3DP) is a revolutionary
   technology which has been around for more than two decades, although the
   potential of this technique was not fully explored until recently.
   Because of the expansion of this technology in recent years, new
   materials and additives are being searched for to meet the growing
   demand. 3DP allows accurate fabrication of complicated models, however,
   structural anisotropy caused by the 3DP approaches could limit robust
   application. A possible solution to the inferior properties of the 3DP
   based materials compared to that of conventionally manufactured
   counterparts could be the incorporation of nanoparticles, such as carbon
   nanotubes (CNT) which have demonstrated remarkable mechanical,
   electrical, and thermal properties. In this article we review some of
   the research, products, and challenges involved in 3DP technology. The
   importance of CNT dispersion in the matrix polymer is highlighted and
   the future outlook for the 3D printed polymer/CNT nanocomposites is

   Failure Modes and Thermal Simulation},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) of large-scale polymer and composite parts
   using robotic arms integrated with extruders has received significant
   attention in recent years. Despite the contributions of great technical
   progress and material development towards optimizing this manufacturing
   method, different failure modes observed in the final printed products
   have hindered its application in producing large engineering structures
   used in aerospace and automotive industries. We report failure modes in
   a variety of printed polymer and composite parts, including fuel tanks
   and car bumpers. Delamination and warpage observed in these parts
   originate mostly from thermal gradients and residual stresses
   accumulated during material deposition and cooling. Because printing
   large structures requires expensive resources, process simulation to
   recognize the possible failure modes can significantly lower the
   manufacturing cost. In this regard, accurate prediction of temperature
   distribution using thermal simulations is the first step. Finite element
   analysis (FEA) was used for process simulation of large-scale robotic
   AM. The important steps of the simulation are presented, and the
   challenges related to the modeling are recognized and discussed in
   detail. The numerical results showed reasonable agreement with the
   temperature data measured by an infrared camera. While in small-scale
   extrusion AM, the cooling time to the glassy state is less than 1 s, in
   large-scale AM, the cooling time is around two orders of magnitudes
   longer.},

Title = {Beads for Cell Immobilization: Comparison of Alternative Additive
   Manufacturing Techniques},
Journal = {BIOENGINEERING-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The attachment or entrapment of microbial cells and enzymes are
   promising solutions for various industrial applications. When the traps
   are beads, they are dispersed in a fluidized bed in a vessel where a
   pump guarantees fresh liquid inflow and waste outflow without washing
   out the cells. Scientific papers report numerous types of cell
   entrapment, but most of their applications remain at the laboratory
   level. In the present research, rigid polymer beads were manufactured by
   two different additive manufacturing (AM) techniques in order to verify
   the economy, reusability, and stability of the traps, with a view toward
   a straightforward industrial application. The proposed solutions allowed
   for overcoming some of the drawbacks of traditional manufacturing
   solutions, such as the limited mechanical stability of gel traps, and
   they guaranteed the possibility of producing parts of constant quality
   with purposely designed exchange surfaces, which are unfeasible when
   using conventional processes. AM proved to be a viable manufacturing
   solution for beads with complex shapes of two different size ranges. A
   deep insight into the production and characteristics of beads
   manufactured by AM is provided. The paper provides biotechnologists with
   a manufacturing perspective, and the results can be directly applied to
   transit from the laboratory to the industrial scale.},

   describes a demonstration component which was designed and manufactured

   configuration was an open channel structure, while the second contained
   a dynamic absorber in the internal cavity. Frequency response
   measurements of the two components showed a significant magnitude
   reduction for the modified component at the original open channel
   structure's natural frequency and an overall increase in dynamic
   stiffness. Polymer damping material was then added to further increase
   the dynamic stiffness.},

Abstract = {The diverse suite of contaminants released to the environment requires
   creative solutions. This research identifies novel application of
   additive manufacturing to rapidly prototype functional composite
   structures to adsorb contaminants. Ammonia contamination of water from
   natural and anthropogenic sources is common. Granular zeolite removes
   ammonia from water but is not easy to deploy and retrieve from
   environmental media. This work employed a 3D printer to customize
   deployable and retrievable devices that remove ammonia from water. Twin
   screw compounding of zeolite into polylactic acid (PLA) provided
   printable composites (approximate to 16 wt \% zeolite). Simple placement
   of the printed structures in vials containing ammonia contaminated water
   (1.2-12.2 mg/L) significantly reduced concentrations (40-60\%) under
   static water conditions relevant to bioassays or anoxic conditions.
   Surficial abrasion of composite surfaces may facilitate additional
   ammonia removal. Normalization to zeolite mass indicated printed
   PLA-zeolite composites performed comparably to free zeolite. Most
   ammonia removal occurred within 48 h, with diminishing benefit with
   longer exposure. This first-principles research demonstrated 3D printed
   devices remove ammonia from water. There is potential for future benefit
   through rapid prototyping to optimize efficacy via geometric complexity,
   higher filler loadings, uptake kinetics studies, and different
   filler-polymer pairings for additional contaminants.},

Abstract = {Fiber reinforced polymer composites (FRPCs) are valued for their high
   strength and lightweight and have found applications from aerospace to
   renewable energy. Additive manufacturing (AM, or 3D printing) of FRPCs
   is of great interest in recent years due to the manufacturing
   flexibility offered by AM. Direct ink write (DIW) 3D printing is a
   popular choice for FRPC 3D printing due to its low cost and open
   framework for broad material choices. However, previously explored
   techniques for AM of FRPCs are hindered by heavy reliance on fiber
   orientation dictated by extrusion toolpath and often require specialized
   hardware to print FRPCs with low viscosity and long cure time thermoset
   epoxy matrices. In this paper, we introduce a single-stream hybrid DIW
   AM technique for the creation of mechanically robust FRPC functional
   structures where the matrix is DIW 3D printed, and pre-epoxy impregnated
   (prepreg) woven carbon fiber (CF) fabrics are robotically placed.
   Additionally, functional components, such as conductive elements, can be
   readily integrated. We investigated the impact of prepreg woven CF
   reinforcement on a two-stage photo-thermal thermoset resin matrix on the
   mechanical characteristics of manufactured FRPCs. We also combined these
   efforts to fabricate functional structures, including strain sensors for
   in-situ deformation monitoring, heating elements, and embedded light
   sensors. This study found that the proposed single-stream hybrid DIW AM
   process could be a facile approach to fabricate high-strength FRPC
   functional structures.},

Abstract = {The literature on emissions during material extrusion additive
   manufacturing with 3-D printers is expanding; however, there is a
   paucity of data for large-format additive manufacturing (LFAM) machines
   that can extrude high-melt-temperature polymers. Emissions from two LFAM
   machines were monitored during extrusion of six polymers: acrylonitrile
   butadiene styrene (ABS), polycarbonate (PC), high-melt-temperature
   polysulfone (PSU), poly(ether sulfone) (PESU), polyphenylene sulfide
   (PPS), and Ultem (poly(ether imide)). Particle number, total volatile
   organic compound (TVOC), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2)
   concentrations were monitored in real-time. Particle emission rate
   values (no./min) were as follows: ABS (1.7 x 10(11) to 7.7 x 10(13)), PC
   (5.2 x 10(11) to 3.6 x 10(13)), Ultem (5.7 x 10(12) to 3.1 x 10(13)),
   PPS (4.6 x 10(11) to 6.2 x 10(12)), PSU (1.5 x 10(12) to 3.4 x 10(13)),
   and PESU (2.0 to 5.0 x 10(13)). For print jobs where the mass of
   extruded polymer was known, particle yield values (g(-1) extruded) were
   as follows: ABS (4.5 x 10(8) to 2.9 x 10(11)), PC (1.0 x 10(9) to 1.7 x
   10(11)), PSU (5.1 x 10(9) to 1.2 x 10(11)), and PESU (0.8 x 10(11) to
   1.7 x 10(11)). TVOC emission yields ranged from 0.005 mg/g extruded
   (PESU) to 0.7 mg/g extruded (ABS). The use of wall-mounted exhaust
   ventilation fans was insufficient to completely remove airborne
   particulate and TVOC from the print room. Real-time CO monitoring was
   not a useful marker of particulate and TVOC emission profiles for Ultem,
   PPS, or PSU. Average CO2 and particle concentrations were moderately
   correlated (r(s) = 0.76) for PC polymer. Extrusion of ABS, PC, and four
   high-melt-temperature polymers by LFAM machines released particulate and
   TVOC at levels that could warrant consideration of engineering controls.
   LFAM particle emission yields for some polymers were similar to those of
   common desktop-scale 3-D printers.},

Abstract = {The assessment of the extent of degradation of polymer molecules during
   processing via conventional (e.g., extrusion and injection molding) and
   emerging (e.g., additive manufacturing; AM) techniques is important for
   both the final polymer material performance with respect to technical
   specifications and the material circularity. In this contribution, the
   most relevant (thermal, thermo-mechanical, thermal-oxidative,
   hydrolysis) degradation mechanisms of polymer materials during
   processing are discussed, addressing conventional extrusion-based
   manufacturing, including mechanical recycling, and AM. An overview is
   given of the most important experimental characterization techniques,
   and it is explained how these can be connected with modeling tools. Case
   studies are incorporated, dealing with polyesters, styrene-based
   materials, and polyolefins, as well as the typical AM polymers.
   Guidelines are formulated in view of a better molecular scale driven

Abstract = {Conversion of inorganic-organic frameworks (ceramic precursors and
   ceramic-polymer mixtures) into solid mass ceramic structures based on
   photopolymerization process is currently receiving plentiful attention
   in the field of additive manufacturing (3D printing). Various techniques
   (e.g., stereolithography, digital light processing, and two-photon
   polymerization) that are compatible with this strategy have so far been
   widely investigated. This is due to their cost-viability, flexibility,
   and ability to design and manufacture complex geometric structures.
   Different platforms related to these techniques have been developed too,
   in order to meet up with modern technology demand. Most relevant to this
   review are the challenges faced by the researchers in using these 3D
   printing techniques for the fabrication of ceramic structures. These
   challenges often range from shape shrinkage, mass loss, poor
   densification, cracking, weak mechanical performance to undesirable
   surface roughness of the final ceramic structures. This is due to the
   brittle nature of ceramic materials. Based on the summary and discussion
   on the current progress of material-technique correlation available,
   here we show the significance of material composition and printing
   processes in addressing these challenges. The use of appropriate solid
   loading, solvent, and preceramic polymers in forming slurries is
   suggested as steps in the right direction. Techniques are indicated as
   another factor playing vital roles and their selection and development
   are suggested as plausible ways to remove these barriers.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study presents a method for fabricating multi-material
   objects using a hybrid additive and subtractive approach. By hybridizing
   the material composition in addition to the fabrication process,
   functional requirements can be met more effectively than through
   homogenous material parts produced using a single manufacturing process.
   Development of multi-material objects consisting of dissimilar materials
   that have been hampered by a lack of a structural interface compatible
   with in-envelope hybrid additive and subtractive manufacturing.
   Design/methodology/approach This research presents a novel method for
   producing multi-material components through in-envelope hybrid additive
   and subtractive manufacturing. This study attempts to address the
   absence of a metal-polymer interface by integrating polymer additive
   manufacturing into a five-axis mill. The ability of the polymer additive
   system to reproduce overhang geometries is assessed with different
   levels of cooling. The relationship between structural performance,
   cooling and material flow rate is evaluated for the deposited carbon
   fiber reinforced acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. Findings A
   mechanically interlocking root structure is developed to form an
   interface between a machined aluminum region and a polymer region of an
   object. The tensile strength of the metal-polymer object is measured and
   found to be on the same order of magnitude as the bulk three-dimensional
   printed polymer. Originality/value By targeting the material properties
   to the local functional requirements within a part and taking advantage
   of both additive and subtractive manufacturing processes, this study
   will enable broader design options and optimization of performance
   metrics.},

   Manufacturing of patient-tailored tablets},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {586},
Month = {AUG 30},
Abstract = {The main objective of this work was to explore the potential of coupling
   hot-melt extrusion (HME) to Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF), also known
   as Extrusion-Based Additive Manufacturing (EBAM) or 3D Printing, in
   order to manufacture 3D printed tablets with different release behavior
   from plasticizer-free filament matrices. The suitability of different
   thermoplastic polymers towards FFF was investigated, and a link between
   the mechanical properties of filaments produced by HME and the feeding
   performance into the FFF printer was established. Model drugs with
   different aqueous solubility (metoprolol tartrate and theophylline
   anhydrous) were processed with hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymers, and
   the influence of the formulation, drug concentration and applied process
   settings on the release kinetics was investigated. Filaments with up to
   40\% drug load were successfully extruded with a smooth surface and a
   diameter of 1.75 +/- 0.05 mm. However, filaments with high brittleness
   and low toughness were broken by the feeding gears. In contrast, none of
   the filaments were squeezed aside by the gears, which indicated that
   they were sufficiently stiff as indicated by the high Young's moduli of
   all formulations. For all formulations, the release from the tablets
   with 50\% infill degree was faster as compared to the tablets with 100\%
   infill degree. Theophylline (20\% w/w) release from Kollicoat (R) IR
   matrix was completed within 40 min from 50\% infill tablets. In
   contrast, 80\% metoprolol tartrate was released from the hydrophobic
   Capa (R) 6506 polymer within 24hrs from 50\% infill 3D tablets
   containing 40\% w/w MPT.},

Journal = {LUBRICANTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The coating materials commonly used in hydrodynamic bearings are the
   so-called ``Babbitt metals{''} or ``white metals{''}, as defined by ASTM
   B23-00. Their low Young's modulus and yield point have encouraged
   researchers to find new coatings to overcome these limitations. In this
   paper, the friction and wear of PEEK are studied in a dry sliding
   environment (without lubrication) using a ball-on-disk tribometer and
   compared to those of Babbitt metal. Furthermore, the bond strength tests
   between PEEK and metals/alloys are evaluated. PEEK polymer samples were
   obtained from cylindrical rods, manufactured by an innovative process
   for polymer bonding on bearing surfaces, using additive manufacturing
   technology. The morphologies of the degraded surfaces were examined
   using a high-resolution metallurgical optical microscope (OM) and a
   scanning electron microscope (SEM). The coefficients of friction (CoF)
   were obtained under the alternating ball-on-disk dry tribometer. The
   results of the experimental activity show that PEEK polymers have CoFs
   of about 0.22 and 0.16 under the 1 and 5 N applied load, respectively.
   The CoF and wear volume loss results are reported and compared to the
   reference Babbitt coating.},

Abstract = {The latest developments in smart systems for improved human lives with
   advanced biomedical devices have evolved out of multi-disciplinary
   scientific studies, including medicine, biology, material sciences,
   design, manufacturing, artificial intelligence, microelectronics, and so
   forth. The growth of such intelligent systems is primarily possible with
   innovative materials, which demonstrate the response to various external
   stimuli like temperature, heat, moisture, light, electromagnetic field,
   and chemical alteration. Such materials have been recently fabricated
   using different additive manufacturing techniques to devise personalized
   unique, complex, and novel structures that can adjust to external
   conditions over time and are specifically attributed to 4D printing.
   Novel materials that can further improve such systems continued to be
   explored and employed. This review paper investigates the additive
   manufacturing of functional polymer nanocomposites, which offer
   compliant structures with flexible manufacturing processes with high
   strength, low cost, and long-term stability. This study aims to deliver

Abstract = {Brass instruments mouthpieces have been historically built using metal
   materials, usually brass. With the auge of additive manufacturing
   technologies new possibilities have arisen, both for testing alternative
   designs and for using new materials. This work assesses the use of
   polymers for manufacturing trombone mouthpieces, specifically PLA and
   Nylon. The acoustical behavior of these two mouthpieces has been
   compared with the obtained from a third one, built from brass. Both
   additive and subtractive manufacturing techniques were used, and the
   whole manufacturing process is described. The mouthpieces were
   acoustically assessed in an anechoic chamber with the collaboration of a
   professional performer. The harmonic analysis confirmed that all the
   manufactured mouthpieces respect the harmonic behavior of the
   instrument. An energy analysis of the harmonics revealed slight
   differences between the mouthpieces, which implies differences in the
   timbre of the instrument. Although these subtle differences would not be
   acceptable when performing with the instrument in an orchestra, they
   could be perfectly valid for early learners, personal rehearsals or any
   kind of alternative performance.},

   techniques for polymer material systems},
Journal = {MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {While the developments of additive manufacturing (AM) techniques have
   been remarkable thus far, they are still significantly limited by the
   range of printable, functional material systems that meet the
   requirements of a broad range of industries; including the health care,
   manufacturing, packaging, aerospace, and automotive industries.
   Furthermore, with the rising demand for sustainable developments, this
   review broadly gives the reader a good overview of existing AM
   techniques; with more focus on the extrusion-based technologies (fused
   deposition modeling and direct ink writing) due to their scalability,
   cost efficiency and wider range of material processability. It then goes
   on to identify the innovative materials and recent research activities
   that may support the sustainable development of extrusion-based
   techniques for functional and multifunctional (4D printing) part and
   product fabrication. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is recently imposing as a fast, reliable,
   and highly flexible solution to process various materials, that range
   from metals to polymers, to achieve a broad variety of customized
   end-goods without involving the injection molding process. The
   employment of biomaterials is of utmost relevance as the environmental
   footprint of the process and, consequently, of the end-goods is
   significantly decreased. Additive manufacturing can provide, in
   particular, an all-in-one platform to fabricate complex-shaped biobased
   items such as bone implants or biomedical devices, that would be,
   otherwise, extremely troublesome and costly to achieve.
   Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) is an emerging class of biobased and
   biodegradable polymeric materials achievable by fermentation from
   bacteria. There are some promising scientific and technical reports on
   the manufacturing of several commodities in PHAs by additive
   manufacturing. However, many challenges must still be faced in order to
   expand further the use of PHAs. In this framework, the present work
   reviews and classifies the relevant papers focused on the design and
   development of PHAs for different 3D printing techniques and overviews
   the most recent applications of this approach.},

Abstract = {Microscale porous membranes are used in a wide range of technical and
   medical applications such as water treatment, dialysis and in vitro test
   systems. A promising approach to control membrane properties and
   overcome limitations of conventional fabrication techniques is given by
   additive manufacturing (AM). In this study, we designed and printed a
   microporous membrane via digital light processing and validated its use
   for biomedical in vitro applications based on the example of a cell
   culture insert. A multi-layer technique was developed, resulting in an
   eight-layer membrane with an average pore diameter of 25 mu m. Image
   analyses proved the printing accuracy to be high with small deviations
   for an increasing number of layers. Permeability tests with brilliant
   blue FCF (E133, triarylmethane dye) and growth factors comparing the
   printed to track-etched membranes showed similar transfer dynamics and
   confirmed sufficient separation properties. Overall, the results showed
   that printing microporous polymer membranes is possible and highlight
   the potential of AM for biomedical in vitro applications such as cell
   culture inserts, scaffolds for tissue engineering or bioreactors.},

Abstract = {Water-soluble polymers as sacrificial supports for additive
   manufacturing (AM) facilitate complex features in printed objects. Few
   water-soluble polymers beyond poly(vinyl alcohol) enable material
   extrusion AM. In this work, charged poly(ether ester)s with tailored
   rheological and mechanical properties serve as novel materials for
   extrusion-based AM at low temperatures. Melt transesterification of
   poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, 8k) and dimethyl 5-sulfoisophthalate
   afforded poly(ether ester)s of sufficient molecular weight to impart
   mechanical integrity. Quantitative ion exchange provided a library of
   poly(ether ester)s with varying counterions, including both monovalent
   and divalent cations. Dynamic mechanical and tensile analysis revealed
   an insignificant difference in mechanical properties for these polymers
   below the melting temperature, suggesting an insignificant change in
   final part properties. Rheological analysis, however, revealed the
   advantageous effect of divalent countercations (Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) in
   the melt state and exhibited an increase in viscosity of two orders of
   magnitude. Furthermore, time temperature superposition identified an
   elevation in modulus, melt viscosity, and flow activation energy,
   suggesting intramolecular interactions between polymer chains and a
   higher apparent molecular weight. In particular, extrusion of
   poly(PEG(8k)-co-CaSIP) revealed vast opportunities for extrusion AM of
   well-defined parts. The unique melt rheological properties highlighted
   these poly(ether ester) ionomers as ideal candidates for low-temperature
   material extrusion additive manufacturing of water-soluble parts.},

Abstract = {The currently growing demand for metallic and polymeric products has
   undoubtedly changed the rules of manufacturing, enabling customers to
   more functionally define their products based on their needs. Nowadays,
   a new technique for rapid tooling, Additive Manufacturing (AM), can
   create customized products with more complex geometries and short life
   cycles (flexibility) in order to keep up with the new variables imposed
   by the manufacturing environment. In the last two decades, the migration
   from subtractive manufacturing to AM has materialized such products with
   reduced costs and cycle times. AM has been recently promoted to develop
   polymer molds for product manufacturing. This paper reviews the main
   findings in the literature concerning polymer molds created by AM
   compared to conventional (metal) molds obtained by subtractive
   manufacturing. Information about specific topics is scarce or
   nonexistent, for example, about the characterization of the most
   commonly injected materials and molds used in this type of technology,
   their mechanical properties (part and mold), designs for all types of
   geometries, and costs. These aspects are addressed in this literature
   review, highlighting the advantages of this alternative manufacturing
   process, which is considered a desirable technology worldwide.},

Title = {Fabrication of High-Performance CNT Reinforced Polymer Composite for
   Additive Manufacturing by Phase Inversion Technique},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) of polymer composites has enabled the
   fabrication of highly customized parts with notably mechanical
   properties, thermal and electrical conductivity compared to
   un-reinforced polymers. Employing the reinforcements was a key factor in
   improving the properties of polymers after being 3D printed. However,
   almost all the existing 3D printing methods could make the most of
   disparate fiber reinforcement techniques, the fused filament fabrication
   (FFF) method is reviewed in this study to better understand its
   flexibility to employ for the proposed novel method. Carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs) as a desirable reinforcement have a great potential to improve
   the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of 3D printed
   polymers. Several functionalization approaches for the preparation of
   CNT reinforced composites are discussed in this study. However, due to
   the non-uniform distribution and direction of reinforcements, the
   properties of the resulted specimen do not change as theoretically
   expected. Based on the phase inversion method, this paper proposes a
   novel technique to produce CNT-reinforced filaments to simultaneously
   increase the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties. A
   homogeneous CNT dispersion in a dilute polymer solution is first
   obtained by sonication techniques. Then, the CNT/polymer filaments with
   the desired CNT content can be obtained by extracting the polymer's
   solvent. Furthermore, optimizing the filament draw ratio can result in a
   reasonable CNT orientation along the filament stretching direction.},

Abstract = {Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is a widely used industrial coating
   technique for depositing polymer, ceramic, and metal thin films.
   Recently, there has been interested in using EPD for additive
   manufacturing using reconfigurable electrodes. Here, we report the first
   projector-based light-directed electrophoretic deposition (EPD) system
   that uses projected digital masks to dynamically control the electric
   field, eliminating the need for physical photomasks. We demonstrate a
   resolution limit of 10 pm for the deposited feature, which corresponds
   to the limits of the optical system. Furthermore, the first 3D
   overhanging structure made with EPD is presented, which points to the
   ability to create architected cellular materials. These improvements
   open the possibility for EPD to be a true 3D additive manufacturing
   technique.},

Title = {The Post-Processing of Additive Manufactured Polymeric and Metallic
   Parts},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING AND MATERIALS PROCESSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The traditional manufacturing industry has been revolutionized with the
   introduction of additive manufacturing which is based on layer-by-layer
   manufacturing. Due to these tool-free techniques, complex shape
   manufacturing becomes much more convenient in comparison to traditional
   machining. However, additive manufacturing comes with its inherent
   process characteristics of high surface roughness, which in turn effect
   fatigue strength as well as residual stresses. Therefore, in this paper,
   common post-processing techniques for additive manufactured (AM) parts
   were examined. The main objective was to analyze the finishing processes
   in terms of their ability to finish complicated surfaces and their
   performance were expressed as average surface roughness (Sa and Ra). The
   techniques were divided according to the materials they applied to and
   the material removal mechanism. It was found that chemical finishing
   significantly reduces surface roughness and can be used to finish parts
   with complicated geometry. Laser finishing, on the other hand, cannot be
   used to finish intricate internal surfaces. Among the mechanical
   abrasion methods, abrasive flow finishing shows optimum results in terms
   of its ability to finish complicated freeform cavities with improved
   accuracy for both polymer and metal parts. However, it was found that,
   in general, most mechanical abrasion processes lack the ability to
   finish complex parts. Moreover, although most of post-processing methods
   are conducted using single finishing processes, AM parts can be finished
   with hybrid successive processes to reap the benefits of different
   post-processing techniques and overcome the limitation of individual
   process.},

   Manufacturing Printability: A Case Study with Poly(ethylene

Journal = {MACROMOLECULAR MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Semi-crystalline polymers are an important class of materials for
   engineering applications due to their high modulus and barrier
   properties. Traditional manufacturing methods process semi-crystalline
   polymers via rigid molds and well-controlled temperature and pressure
   environments to handle the significant change in specific volume
   occurring during crystallization; however, material extrusion additive
   manufacturing does not use these features. This often leads to
   warpage-induced build failure in fused filament fabrication (FFF). To
   enable FFF of semi-crystalline polymers, this work investigates
   characteristics of immiscible polymer blends (e.g., disparate
   crystallization behavior and phase separation) to mitigate warping
   failure during printing. A series of poly(ethylene
   terephthalate)/polypropylene/polypropylene-graft-maleic anhydride blends
   are explored and the effect of thermal and morphological characteristics
   on printability is analyzed. It is shown that these blends can be
   extruded into filament and printed into a 3D structure. Extrapolations
   indicate that phase-separated blends with increased total
   crystallization half-time are beneficial for FFF printing.},

Abstract = {In order to overcome challenges typically encountered during additive
   manufacturing of ceramics via the polymer precursor route, a novel
   polymer-derived SiOC/SiC composite system suitable for advanced
   geometric designs achievable by lithography-based ceramic manufacturing
   was established. The photoreactive resin system filled with 20 wt\% SiC
   exhibits suitable viscosity characteristics, adequate stability against
   sedimentation, and a fast photocuring behavior. After printing and
   pyrolytic conversion, SiC particulates were well-dispersed within the
   polymer-derived SiOC matrix. A direct comparison with the unfilled
   polysiloxane-based resin system showed that the addition of particulate
   SiC increases handleability, reduces shrinkage, and significantly
   increases critical wall thicknesses up to 5 mm. The biaxial
   Ball-on-Three-Balls testing methodology yielded a characteristic
   strength of 325 MPa for SiOC/SiC composites. The results highlight the
   high potential of particle-filled pre -ceramic polymer systems toward
   the fabrication of high-performance SiC-based materials by

Abstract = {Properties of polymer-metal hybrid structure printed by fed friction
   stir additive manufacturing (FFSAM) were evaluated. FFSAM is advanced
   solid-state additive manufacturing for the printing of macro-scale

   layer printing of polymer and metal sheets convert to paste phase and
   join together as a uniform structure. With this process, during printing
   of hybrid structure, nanocomposite polymer is injected at the interface
   of base materials to fill voids and recover properties of the polymer
   matrix: polypropylene (PP) and stainless steel (SS) fabric selected as
   raw materials. During the printing process, Fe2O3 nanoparticles fed into
   the interface of PP and steel sheets. The mechanical and metallurgical
   characterization of printed PP@SS@Fe2O3 nanocomposite structure is
   evaluated. Macrostructure, tensile strength, hardness, and
   thermo-chemical properties of the printed structure were assessed and
   discussed. The result indicated that the In-situ feeding mechanism

Title = {Additive manufacturing of elastomeric foam with cell unit design for
   broadening compressive stress plateau},
Journal = {RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL},

Pages = {1579-1585},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide additive
   manufacturing-based solutions for preparation of elastomeric foam with
   broaden compressive stress plateau.
   Design/methodology/approach Mechanic models are developed for obtaining
   designs of foam cell units with enhanced elastic buckling. An
   experimental approach is taken to fabricate the foams based on direct
   ink writing technique. Experimental and simulation data are collected to
   assist understanding of our proposals and solutions.
   Findings A simple tetragonal structured elastomeric foam is proposed and
   fabricated by direct ink writing, in which its cell unit is
   theoretically designed by repeating every four filament layers. The foam
   exhibits a broader stress plateau, because of the pronounced elastic
   buckling under compressive loading as predicted by the authors' mechanic
   modeling. A two-stage stress plateaus as observed in the foam, being
   attributed to the dual elastic buckling of the cell units along two
   lateral directions of the XY plane during compression.
   Research limitations/implications Future work should incorporate more
   microscopic parameters to tune the elastomeric foam for mechanic
   performance testing on linear elastic deformation and densification of
   polymer matrix.
   Practical implications Additive manufacturing offers an alternative to
   fabricate elastomeric foam with controlled cell unit design and
   therefore mechanics. Our results comment on its broad space for
   development such superior cushioning or damping material in the fields
   of vibration and energy absorption.

Abstract = {Adhesion plays a central role in additive manufacturing (AM) processes
   like Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM). The printed part needs sufficient
   adhesion to the build plate. The adhesion in between the printed
   material layers defines the mechanical strength of the component.
   Post-processing processes such as painting or bonding require good
   chemical coupling, as does the combination of different materials (FDM
   of different polymers, integration of metal inserts).
   Unfortunately, sufficient adhesion is not given for all material
   combinations. An interesting and flexible possibility to influence the
   surface chemistry and thus the chemical bonding are surface
   functionalization by using atmospheric pressure plasma technologies.
   These have been used for many years with great success for the surface
   treatment of polymers. Depending on the plasma parameters used, it is
   possible to clean and etch surfaces, to functionalise surfaces with
   reactive chemical groups, to deposit layers or to cross-link polymers.
   While this is already used for treatment of 2D and 3D substrates in many
   applications, the integration of new functionalities by plasma into
   additive manufacturing processes is of great interest. This allows new
   functionalities to be integrated into 3D-printed components and
   simplifies further processing.
   At the Fraunhofer IST various approaches of small atmospheric pressure
   plasma sources are under development which can be easily integrated into
   the additive manufacturing process. Small point-shaped plasma modules
   for the sequential treatment of defined areas were built-up and
   integrated into commercially available FDM printers. With these plasma
   sources, the plasma treatment of defined areas of the components is
   possible during 3D printing. Integrated plasma sources enable moreover
   the in-situ treatment of internal surfaces which are subsequently no
   longer accessible for other treatment processes. This can create new
   products and expand the scope of additive manufacturing.},

Title = {3-D Printable Polymer Pelletizer Chopper for Fused Granular
   Fabrication-Based Additive Manufacturing},
Journal = {INVENTIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {3},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Although distributed additive manufacturing can provide high returns on
   investment, the current markup on commercial filament over base polymers
   limits deployment. These cost barriers can be surmounted by eliminating
   the entire process of fusing filament by three-dimensional (3-D)
   printing products directly from polymer granules. Fused granular
   fabrication (FGF) (or fused particle fabrication (FPF)) is being held
   back in part by the accessibility of low-cost pelletizers and choppers.
   An open-source 3-D printable invention disclosed here allows for
   precisely controlled pelletizing of both single thermopolymers as well
   as composites for 3-D printing. The system is designed, built, and
   tested for its ability to provide high-tolerance thermopolymer pellets
   with a number of sizes capable of being used in an FGF printer. In
   addition, the chopping pelletizer is tested for its ability to chop
   multi-materials simultaneously for color mixing and composite
   fabrication as well as precise fractional measuring back to filament.
   The US\$185 open-source 3-D printable pelletizer chopper system was
   successfully fabricated and has a 0.5 kg/h throughput with one motor,
   and 1.0 kg/h throughput with two motors using only 0.24 kWh/kg during
   the chopping process. Pellets were successfully printed directly via FGF
   as well as indirectly after being converted into high-tolerance filament
   in a recyclebot.},

Title = {Nozzle-integrated pre-deposition and post-deposition heating of
   previously deposited layers in polymer extrusion based additive
   manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {719-726},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The adhesion and merging of adjacent filaments in polymer extrusion
   based additive manufacturing (AM) plays a key role in determining the
   thermal and mechanical properties of the built part. It is well known
   that maintaining the deposited filaments at a high temperature aids in
   the process of adhesion and merging. While external mechanisms such as
   laser and infrared heating have been used in the past to heat up
   deposited filaments, this paper presents a simpler, less invasive and in
   situ mechanism for heating of previously deposited layers using a hot
   metal block integrated with and rastering together with the
   filament-dispensing nozzle. Infrared thermography based quantitative
   measurement of temperature field along the raster line is carried out
   for two configurations - a preheater and a postheater traveling ahead of
   or behind the nozzle respectively. In each case, significant temperature
   rise in the deposited filaments is shown. A configuration comprising
   both preheater and postheater is shown to result in additional thermal
   benefits. The measured temperature rise is shown to be a function of
   process parameters such as raster speed and heater-to-base gap.
   Experimental measurements are shown to agree well with theoretical and
   simulation models. Cross-section imaging of samples printed without and
   with the in situ heating clearly show significant improvement in neck
   growth and filament-to-filament merging compared to the baseline case.
   Improvement in thermal and structural performance of printed samples is
   also demonstrated. Compared to other techniques proposed in the past,
   the heating approach presented in this work is passive and requires
   minimal additional costs or complexity. The improved temperature field
   and consequently enhanced filament adhesion reported here may help
   design and build parts with superior thermal and mechanical properties
   using polymer AM.},

   Polymer-Based Additive Manufacturing},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A novel approach to detect and decode direct-part-marked, low-contrast
   data matrix codes on polymer-based selective laser sintering
   manufactured parts, which is able to work on lightweight devices, is
   presented. Direct-part marking is a concept for labeling parts directly,
   which can be carried out during the additive manufacturing's design
   process. Because of low contrast in polymer-based selective laser
   sintering manufactured parts, it is a challenging task to detect and
   read codes on unicolored parts. To achieve this, at first, codes are
   located using a deep-learning-based approach. Afterwards, the calculated
   regions of interest are passed into an image encoding network in order
   to compute readable standard data matrix codes. To enhance the training
   process, rendered images, improved with a generative adversarial
   network, are used. This process fulfills the traceability task in
   assembly line production and is suitable for running on mobile devices
   such as smartphones or cheap sensors placed in the assembly line. The
   results show that codes can be localized with 97.38\% mean average
   precision, and a readability of 89.36\% is achieved.},

   used for digital light processing printing of flexible green parts in
   designed shapes. These parts were subsequently transformed into complex
   structures by an assisted secondary molding strategy that enabled the
   morphology of their green and pyrolyzed forms to be well controlled. The
   collapse of bulk pyrolyzed parts was avoided by impregnating their
   precursors with silicon nitride (Si3N4) particles. The effects of
   different proportions of Si3N4 on the weight loss, shrinkage, density,
   porosity, and mechanical properties of the pyrolyzed composites were
   investigated, and the bending strength and Vickers hardness of the

Abstract = {The occurrence of fire in a confined environment surrounded by polymeric
   components can lead to disastrous consequences. This makes it essential
   to consider flame-retardant polymers in critical applications, such as
   aircraft, automobile, and building interior designs. Conventional
   flame-retardant methods are dependent on either adding halogen or
   phosphorous based chemicals to achieve the required attributes. There
   are also polymeric options that are intrinsically fire-resistant and can
   satisfy the fire safety regulatory standards such as the UL94 or FAR
   25.853. However, the window of options is quite narrow, considering
   other aspects such as the eco-friendliness, mechanical or chemical
   properties, and processing difficulties. On the other hand, additive
   manufacturing technologies are gaining ground in recent times, gradually
   making application potentials in both automotive and aerospace
   industries. Considering the point-by-point or line-by-line material
   consolidation mechanics, the fire-retardant options will further shrink
   if they have to be processed by additive methods. Research has led to
   specific options such as the Nylon FR series, ULTEM series, PAEK, and
   PEEK, processed by both selective laser sintering and fused deposition
   modelling. This paper reviews the current state of the additive
   processing of fire-retardant materials, clearly elucidating the
   material, process, structure, and property relationships and the
   fire-retardant standards. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The widespread popularity of additive manufacturing (AM), more
   colloquially referred to as `3D printing' suggests a revolution in
   manufacturing and construction technologies. Additive manufacturing
   devices are now so economical that home improvement stores are marketing
   them to the do-it-yourself (DIY) home improvement market. Rapidly
   maturing AM applications and material choices include metals, polymers,
   and ceramics but concrete has not achieved the same level of acceptance
   or advancement. Isolated and prototypical AM concrete applications have
   been implemented but widespread adoption may require intense material

Abstract = {As Additive Manufacturing (AM) opens new doors to manufacture products
   that are costlier to manufacture by traditional methods, material
   selection for feedstock in AM processes poses significant importance.
   Although there has been research advances in material usage in AM
   technologies, optimal selection of AM materials has not been thoroughly
   researched. As there are many candidate materials for any application
   starting with a range of polymers, the most common AM material's type,
   metals and ceramics, this paper introduces an integrated heuristic and
   mathematical algorithms for optimizing the material selection for
   different AM applications. In addition, a material selection matrix is
   developed to rank recommended materials based on weighted criteria
   depending on the application. The developed matrix through the selection
   algorithms enable AM users to make informed material selection
   decisions. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing with Polyethylene Vitrimers},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Polyethylene (PE) is one of the most widely used polymers in
   conventional polymer manufacturing processes. However, it remains a
   challenge to use PE in extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM). Some
   of the challenges that this material presents include low self-adhesion
   and shrinkage during the printing process. These two issues lead to
   higher mechanical anisotropy when compared to other materials, along
   with poor dimensional accuracy and warpage. Vitrimers are a new class of
   polymers that have a dynamic crosslinked network, allowing the material
   to be healed and reprocessed. Prior studies on polyolefin vitrimers
   suggest that the crosslinks reduce the degree of crystallinity and
   increase the dimensional stability at elevated temperatures. In this
   study, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and HDPE vitrimers (HDPE-V) were
   successfully processed using a screw-assisted 3D printer. It was
   demonstrated that HDPE-V were able to reduce shrinkage during the
   printing process. This shows that 3D printing with HDPE-V will provide
   better dimensional stability when compared to regular HDPE. Furthermore,
   after an annealing process, 3D-printed HDPE-V samples showed a decrease
   in mechanical anisotropy. This annealing process was only possible in
   HDPE-V due to their superior dimensional stability at elevated
   temperatures, with minimal deformation above melting temperature.},

Title = {Predicting material properties for embedded structures created with
   polymer material extrusion additive manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Embedding with additive manufacturing (AM) is a process of incorporating
   functional components, such as sensors and actuators, in the printed
   structure by inserting them into a specially designed cavity. The print
   process has to be interrupted after the cavity is printed to insert the
   component. This allows for multifunctional structures to be created
   directly from the build plate. However, previous research has shown that
   this process interruption causes failure at the paused layer due to the
   cooling between the layers. The presence of the designed cavity further
   impacts the strength of the part due to a reduction in the effective
   cross-section in contact between the paused and the resumed layers. This
   research presents a methodology to predict the weld strength between the
   layers of an embedded material extrusion structure by obtaining the
   thermal history at the layer interface as a result of process
   interruption. An infrared camera and an embedded thermocouple are used
   to obtain the thermal history of the depositing fresh layer and of the
   layer interface, respectively. The impact of toolpath design on the
   thermal history of the layer interface is considered by dividing the
   cross-section area into zones with similar thermal history. Polymer weld
   theory is utilized to predict the strength at these different zones,
   where material properties are obtained through rheology measurements.
   These strength values for the zones are then used to predict the load at
   failure for different specimens by treating them as composites. Findings
   confirm that this approach can be used to more accurately predict
   tensile loads at failure for embedded structures, with errors ranging
   from 1\% to 20 \% depending on the toolpath geometry.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing has gained great interest in the microfluidic
   community due to the numerous channel designs which can be tested in the
   early phases of a lab-on-a-chip device development. High resolution
   additive manufacturing like microstereolithography is largely associated
   with polymers. Polymers are at a disadvantage compared to other
   materials due to their softness and low chemical resistance. Whenever
   high chemical and thermal resistance combined with high optical
   transparency is needed, glasses become the material of choice. However,
   glasses are difficult to structure at the microscale requiring hazardous
   chemicals for etching processes. In this work we present additive
   manufacturing and high resolution patterning of microfluidic chips in
   transparent fused silica glass using stereolithography and
   microlithography. We print an amorphous silica nanocomposite at room
   temperature using benchtop stereolithography printers and a custom built
   microlithography system based on a digital mirror device. Using
   microlithography we printed structures with tens of micron resolution.
   The printed part is then converted to a transparent fused silica glass
   using thermal debinding and sintering. Printing of a microfluidic chip
   can be done within 30 minutes. The heat treatment can be done within two
   days.},

Abstract = {The production of conductive and organic devices from a 3D printer
   represents a promising strategy for several areas. In particular, the
   synthesis of polypyrrole-coated acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)
   composites can be considered an important step to produce conductive
   supports for 3D printing. Herein, it is reported the production of ABS
   samples through the additive manufacturing process (3D printing)
   accordingly to the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) method. The
   hydrophilic behavior was controlled by the surface treatment using air
   plasma for the following step of coating with polypyrrole (PPy) via an
   in situ polymerization, using two different oxidants: ferric chloride
   (FeCl3.6H2O) and ammonium persulfate (APS). The chemical, optical,
   surface, and electrical properties of these materials were characterized
   through Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), contact angle
   measurements, cyclic voltammetry, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
   4-probe electrical measurement, and mechanical tensile testing. The
   ABS/PPy (FeCl3) composite exhibited a low electrical contact resistance
   and better performance for applications that require electrodes with a
   good conductance level.},

Abstract = {Its transparency, esthetic appeal, chemical inertness, and electrical
   resistivity make glass an excellent candidate for small- and large-scale
   applications in the chemical, electronics, automotive, aerospace, and
   architectural industries. Additive manufacturing of glass has the
   potential to open new possibilities in design and reduce costs
   associated with manufacturing complex customized glass structures that
   are difficult to shape with traditional casting or subtractive methods.
   However, despite the significant progress in the additive manufacturing
   of metals, polymers, and ceramics, limited research has been undertaken
   on additive manufacturing of glass. In this study, a laser powder bed
   fusion method was developed for soda lime silica glass powder feedstock.
   Optimization of laser processing parameters was undertaken to define the
   processing window for creating three-dimensional multilayer structures.
   These findings enable the formation of complex glass structures with
   micro- or macroscale resolution. Our study supports laser powder bed
   fusion as a promising method for the additive manufacturing of glass and
   may guide the formation of a new generation of glass structures for a
   wide range of applications.},

Title = {Measurement of the in-plane temperature field on the build plate during
   polymer extrusion additive manufacturing using infrared thermometry},
Journal = {POLYMER TESTING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {92},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The process of filament-to-filament adhesion during polymer extrusion
   additive manufacturing (AM) is critically influenced by temperature
   distribution around the filament. Direct measurement of temperature
   distribution around the filament being deposited is, therefore,
   important for fully understanding this critical process. While past
   papers have reported side-view (x-z) temperature measurement using
   infrared (IR) thermography, this paper presents measurement of the
   in-plane (x-y) temperature field on the build plate during printing of
   the first layer by infrared thermography. This measurement is carried
   out from under the build plate. A small part of the build plate is
   replaced by an infrared-transparent window. In conjunction with an
   infrared right-angle prism mirror positioned underneath, direct
   measurement of in-plane temperature distribution is carried out with an
   infrared camera. With a thin graphite coating on the build plate,
   in-plane temperature field on the build plate is obtained, whereas
   experiments without the graphite coating result in direct measurement of
   the filament temperature distribution. Bottom-view measurements are
   shown to agree well with side-view measurements. Temperature fields on
   the build plate are measured as functions of time for single-line and
   multi-line printing. A few key features revealed by measurements include
   symmetrical and asymmetrical temperature distributions for single and
   multi-line printing, respectively, and the thermal influence between
   lines being limited only to the adjacent line. The in-plane temperature
   measurement approach complements past side-view measurements, and
   improves upon our understanding of thermal phenomena during polymer AM.},

Title = {An integrated prediction model for processing related yield strength of

Journal = {MECHANICS OF ADVANCED MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {30},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1790-1800},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {As is well acknowledged that mechanical properties of material extrusion
   (ME) additive manufacturing polymers are highly related to processing
   parameters. Meanwhile, the yield strength is one of the key properties
   of a material, which critically affects a component's manufacturing and
   further application. To reveal the effect of printing parameters such as
   layer thickness, printing speed and deposition orientation on the yield
   strength of ME polymers without extensive experimental researches, a
   novel, integrated prediction model accounting for
   processing-structure-property relationship is put forward. In this
   model, processing related representative volume element (RVE) of
   unidirectional ME polymers is firstly estimated by combining the volume
   conservation method and thermal-sintering model. Next, assuming raw
   polymers to be homogenous, isotropic, and ideal elastic-plastic, a
   multiscale approach integrating Hill model and homogenization theory is
   presented to acquire the stress-strain curves of anisotropic ME polymers
   under externally applied loadings. In this procedure, the dependence of
   RVE's estimated anisotropic parameters in Hill model on their external
   loading states is paid attention. By this means, the three-dimensional
   yield behavior of ME polymers, including the off-axis yield strength,
   can be obtained. The validity of the proposed method is examined by
   comparing with existing test data in literature or our measured ones.
   Finally, explicit discussions are made. Many valuable conclusions are
   drawn, which may be of unique significance for the future processing
   optimization and quality improvement of final products.},

   process control, coating qualities, and prospective applications},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {48},
Number = {B},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Polymer metallization via cold spray additive manufacturing is an
   emerging thermal spray approach for deposition of thick metallic
   coatings on polymers and fiber-reinforced composites that promises high
   productivity, ecofriendliness, and scalability of the coating process.
   In polymer metallization via cold spray, solid metallic powder is
   accelerated by a supersonic stream of preheated gas and propelled toward
   a polymer substrate, where it is built layer-by-layer via impact-induced
   heating and particle deformation. Since the pioneering study at
   Cambridge in 2006, nearly 50 experimental reports on polymer
   metallization via cold spray have been published, half of which have
   appeared within the past three years. This review distinguishes cold
   spray from other thermal spray methods, analyzes the peculiarities of
   cold spraying on polymers and fiber-reinforced composites, outlines the
   historical establishment of the field, and summarizes the available
   literature on polymer metallization via cold spray. The major focus here
   is on the influence of the cold spray process parameters on the
   deposition efficiency, adhesion strength, electrical conductivity and
   other properties of metallic coatings formed on polymers and
   fiber-reinforced composites. The promising applications of cold spray
   additive manufacturing in lightning strike protection, electroplating,
   osseointegration, antifouling, antivirus, e.g. anti-Covid-19 surfaces,
   and other surface functionalizations have been reviewed. Finally,
   recommendations were given on how to enhance the data reuse in future
   studies on polymer metallization via cold spray.},

Abstract = {In relation to the fourth industrial revolution, traditional
   manufacturing methods cannot serve the flexibility demands related to
   mass customization and small series production. Rapid tooling provided
   by generative manufacturing has been suggested recently in the context
   of metal forming. Due to the high loads applied during processes to such
   tooling, a purposeful mechanical description of the additively
   manufactured (AM) materials is crucial. Until now, a comprehensive
   characterization approach for AM polymers is required to allow a
   sophisticated layout of rapid tooling. In detail, information on
   compressive and flexural mechanical properties of solid infilled
   materials made by additive manufacturing are sparsely available. These
   elementary mechanical properties are evaluated in the present study.
   They result from material specimens additively manufactured in the fused
   filament fabrication (FFF) process. The design of the experiments
   reveals significant influences of the polymer and the layer height on
   the resulting flexural and compressive strength and modulus as well as
   density, hardness, and surface roughness. As a case study, these
   findings are applied to a cup drawing operation based on the strongest
   and weakest material and parameter combination. The obtained data and
   results are intended to guide future applications of direct polymer
   additive tooling. The presented case study illustrates such an
   application and shows the range of manufacturing quality achievable
   within the materials and user settings for 3D printing.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing is a manufacturing technique
   where successive layers of material are layered to produce parts. The
   design freedom afforded by AM is ideal for the space industry, where
   part production is low volume and highly customized. The objective of
   this paper is to review research in the area of additive manufacturing
   for space (AMFS) in all areas, from propulsion to electronics to
   printing of habitats, and to identify the gaps and directions in the
   research. In this paper, we investigate the AMFS research by splitting
   it into two domains: space and ground-based. Space-based AMFS has been
   performed on the International Space Station using polymers, and we also
   discuss the future of in space AM, a subject closely related to more
   general in space manufacturing. The ground-based research is split into
   three categories based on the printing material: metal, polymer, and
   others. The last category includes regolith, cement, and ceramic. This
   paper explores AMFS by bringing together as much research information as
   possible using a combination of papers, presentations, and news
   articles. We expect that the paper will allow the reader to gain an
   understanding of the current status of AMFS research and will contribute
   to the field as a reference and research guidelines.},

Title = {Room-temperature polymer-assisted additive manufacturing of
   microchanneled magnetocaloric structures},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {920},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {Magnetic refrigeration is an energy-efficient, sustainable,
   environmentally-friendly alternative to the conventional
   vapor-compression cooling technology. There are several magnetic
   refrigerator device designs in existence today that are predicted to be
   highly energy-efficient, on condition that suitable working materials
   can be developed. This challenge in manufacturing magnetocaloric devices
   is unresolved, mainly due to issues related to shaping the mostly
   brittle magnetocaloric alloys into thin-walled channeled regenerator
   structures to facilitate efficient heat transfer between the solid
   refrigerant and the heat exchange fluid in an active magnetic
   regenerator (AMR) cooling device. To address this challenge, a novel
   extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) method has been developed to
   3D print microchanneled magnetocaloric structures. The printing ink
   consists of magnetocaloric powders, a polymer binder, and multiple
   solvents to achieve desirable shear-thinning property, which is critical
   for a robust printing process. Acting as a sacrificial binding agent for
   the magnetic powders, the polymer binder holds the 3D printed structures
   in place and is removed subsequently using a two-step heat-treatment
   process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the fabrication process,
   spatially designed microchannels with minimum dimensions of 150 mu m
   were achieved using nanoscaled La0.6Ca0.4MnO3 powders (diameter\~{}10
   nm). Results indicate that the crystallographic properties and
   magnetofunctional response of the sintered 3D printed samples are
   comparable to that of the precursor powders. Overall, this study
   provides a promising route for realizing lowcost magnetic regenerators,
   thus potentially eliminating one of the main barriers to the
   commercialization of magnetic cooling technology.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {A statistical homogenization approach for incorporating fiber aspect
   ratio distribution in large area polymer composite deposition additive
   manufacturing property predictions},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Assessing the material stiffness of fiber reinforced polymer composites
   deposited in Large Area Additive Manufacturing (LAAM) is needed to
   define the process-structure-property mapping for the LAAM technology.
   While the screw-extrusion-based LAAM systems yield a distribution of
   fiber aspect ratio (i.e., length to diameter ratio for cylindrical
   inclusions) within deposited beads, most composite micromechanical
   models ignore the fiber geometry variation and instead assume a single
   value of fiber aspect ratio. This paper presents a statistics-based
   homogenization approach for including the fiber aspect ratio
   distribution in the prediction of the elastic properties of an extruded
   polymer composite bead. The fiber length distribution of a 13 wt\%
   Carbon Fiber reinforced Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (CF-ABS)
   processed through a LAAM deposition system is measured using high
   resolution optical microscopy. The Weibull probability distribution
   function is employed to statistically describe the measured values. The
   fitted probability density function is then incorporated into a fiber
   orientation homogenization approach to compute the variability of the
   elastic properties of the extruded composite. Elastic properties
   predicted by our proposed method are shown to differ from those
   presented in prior studies that ignored fiber length variability. The
   fiber aspect ratio reduction from fiber length attrition during the LAAM
   single screw-extrusion is shown to decrease the predicted flow-direction
   effective elastic modulus by 7\%. Elastic moduli computed using our
   measured fiber aspect ratio distribution and proposed homogenization
   approach compare well to reported data from previously associated
   experimental studies.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the effects on material
   properties of layer-by-layer application of pressure during fabrication
   of polymeric parts by additive manufacturing (AM). Although AM, also
   known popularly as 3D printing, has set a new standard for ease of use
   and minimal restraint on geometric complexity, the mechanical part
   properties do not generally compare with conventional manufacturing
   processes. Contrary to other types of polymer processing, AM systems do
   not normally use (in-process) pressure during part consolidation.
   Design/methodology/approach - Tensile specimens were produced in Somos
   201 using conventional laser sintering (LS) and selective laser printing
   (SLP) - a process under development in the UK, which incorporates the
   use of pressure to assist layer consolidation.
   Findings - Mechanical testing demonstrated the potential to additively
   manufacture parts with significantly improved microstructure and
   mechanical properties which match or exceed conventional processing. For
   example, the average elongation at break and ultimate tensile strength
   of a conventionally laser-sintered thermoplastic elastomer (Somos 201)
   increased from 136 +/- 28 per cent and 4.9 +/- 0.4 MPa, to 513 +/- 35
   per cent and 10.4 +/- 0.4 MPa, respectively, when each layer was fused
   with in-process application of pressure (126 +/- 9 kPa) by SLP.
   Research limitations/implications - These results are based on
   relatively small sample size, but despite this, the trends observed are
   of significant importance to the elimination of voids and porosity in
   polymeric parts.
   Practical implications - Layerwise application of pressure should be
   investigated further for defect elimination in AM.
   Originality/value - This is the first study on the effects of layerwise
   application of pressure in combination with area-wide fusing.},

Abstract = {In this paper, resin-based photocurable polymer materials for
   stereolithography, digital-light-processing (DLP), and polymer-jetting
   additive manufacturing techniques were characterized from 0.2 to 1.4
   terahertz (THz) for their comprehensive dielectric properties, e.g.,
   refractive index, absorption coefficient, dielectric constant, and loss
   tangent, by using laser-based THz time-domain spectroscopy. A total of
   14 photocurable 3D-printing polymers were chosen, owing to their
   suitability, in terms of printing resolution, material characteristics,
   and so on, for millimeter-wave (mm-wave) and THz applications. The
   measurement results from 0.2 to 1.4THz, the dielectric constants of all
   photopolymer samples under test are between 2.00-3.10, while the loss
   tangents are from 0.008 to 0.102, which are quite useful for many
   applications, e.g., 3D printed antennas and THz transmission lines,
   which were demonstrated by an asymptotically quasi-single-mode Bragg
   fiber microfabricated by DLP micromanufacturing technique using
   HTM140-V2 photopolymer, which is previously reported at the nominal

Abstract = {The traditional tools used in steam-chest moulding technologies for the
   shaping of expanded polymers can be replaced today by lighter moulds,
   accurately designed and produced exploiting the additive manufacturing
   technology. New paradigms have to be considered for mould design,
   assuming that additive manufacturing enables the definition of different
   architectures that are able to improve the performance of the moulding
   process. This work describes the strategies adopted for the design and
   manufacturing by Laser powder bed fusion of the moulds, taking into
   specific consideration their functional surfaces, which rule the heat
   transfer to the moulded material, hence the quality of the products and
   the overall performance of the steam-chest process. The description of a
   case study and the comparison between the performance of the traditional
   solution and the new moulds are also presented to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the new approach. This study demonstrates that the
   re-design and optimization of the mould shape can lead to a significant
   reduction of the energy demand of the process, thanks to a homogeneous
   delivery of the heating steam throughout the part volume, which also
   results in a remarkable cutting of the cycle time.},

Title = {Optical interconnects on a flexible substrate by multi-material hybrid
   additive and subtractive manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {48},
Number = {A},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The integration of flexible photonic components into flexible
   electronics provides new opportunities for applications in imaging,
   sensing, and optical interconnection between devices. While most
   photonic devices are currently printed on rigid substrates, their
   integration on flexible polymer substrates has also been demonstrated in
   recent years. However, current technology of contact and non-contact
   processes limits the type and performance of optical devices on these
   flexible substrates and requires special processes or product design to
   get the entry and exit of optical interconnect end facets out of the
   substrate plane. Here, we show that by utilizing recent advances in
   additive manufacturing, we can print photonic interconnects directly on
   flexible substrates. For our proof-of-concept devices, our results
   demonstrate propagation losses of about 0.35 dB for the six cm samples,
   negligible changes in transmission losses through substrate bending at
   moderate bend radii down to about 5 mm, and no change in optical losses
   during fatigue testing up to 1000 cycles. These results demonstrate how
   flexible photonic devices can be produced using additive manufacturing
   techniques. A type of shape deposition manufacturing, laser
   enhanced-direct print additive manufacturing, is used to manufacture
   these devices. This system of micro-dispensing, fused filament
   fabrication, and laser subtraction has a unique ability to produce
   flexible optoelectronics in a single automated process. We anticipate
   flexible integrated optoelectronics devices based on this new technology
   to be a starting point in the development of more sophisticated devices.},

Abstract = {This research used Ceramic Injection Molding (CIM) formulation technique
   of ceramics/polymers, selecting two Al2O3 powders (alpha- and

   extruding to produce feedstocks and filaments, which was used for 3D
   additive manufacturing. Four tasks were completed. First, PP as the
   major binder, replaced with some EVA, to improve the flexibility of the
   filaments. The compatibility of PP and EVA was also investigated by
   grafting maleic acid (MA) on PP chain to reduce different polarity
   between PP and EVA. The third task was to study the dispersion condition
   of the alumina powder in feedstocks, and quantitatively investigated the
   influence by kneading sequences, solid content, and other processing
   parameters. After optimization the processing conditions, the made
   alumina parts were densified to a relative density better than 98\% in a
   linear sintering shrinkage of 16\%-21\%.},

Title = {Methodology for the Quality Control Process of Additive Manufacturing
   Products Made of Polymer Materials},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The objective of this publication is to present a quality control
   methodology for additive manufacturing products made of polymer
   materials, where the methodology varies depending on the intended use.
   The models presented in this paper are divided into those that are
   manufactured for the purpose of visual presentation and those that
   directly serve the needs of the manufacturing process. The authors also
   a propose a comprehensive control system for the additive manufacturing
   process to meet the needs of Industry 4.0. Depending on the intended use
   of the models, the quality control process is divided into three stages:
   data control, manufacturing control, and post-processing control.
   Research models were made from the following materials: RGD 720
   photopolymer resin (PolyJet method), ABS M30 thermoplastic (FDM method),
   E-Partial photopolymer resin (DLP method), PLA thermoplastic (FFF
   method), and ABS thermoplastic (MEM method). The applied measuring tools
   had an accuracy of at least an order of magnitude higher than that of
   the manufacturing technologies used. The results show that the PolyJet
   method is the most accurate, and the MEM method is the least accurate.
   The findings also confirm that the selection of materials, 3D printing
   methods, and measurement methods should always account not only for the
   specificity and purpose of the model but also for economic aspects, as
   not all products require high accuracy and durability.},

Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},

Volume = {36},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is moving towards series manufacturing
   applications across a variety of industries. However, take-up for series
   production in the automotive industry is still slow and limited to very
   few materials. Therefore, this review assesses compatibility of polymer
   AM processes and materials and provides a method to check their formal
   applicability for automotive series part production. The proposed
   material and process selection method applies basic automotive
   requirements derived from the VDA 232-201 industry standard and an
   interior part case study. Materials and processes in AM are put into
   context via material selection charts and a process compatibility index.
   This graphical analysis enables first judgement about applicability and
   subsequent pre-selection of materials and processes.
   Insights may help users, equipment manufacturers and material developers
   in the fields of AM to match automotive requirements and reduce barriers
   for adoption of AM in series part manufacturing.},

Abstract = {A novel assembling technique based on additive manufacturing and
   materials joining principles has been introduced for layered
   metal-polymer hybrid structures. The AddJoining technique produces
   layered hybrid structures, using polymer 3D printing methods. The
   feasibility of the technique was demonstrated using fused deposition
   modeling for single-lap joint configuration. Microstructure and
   mechanical strength of the joints were studied using two combinations of
   materials; aluminum 2024-T3 with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and
   aluminum 2024-T3 with alternate layers of polyamide-6 and
   carbon-fiber-reinforced polyamide-6. The latter reached an average
   ultimate lap-shear strength of 21.9 +/- 1.1MPa, showing 19\% superior
   performance to the adhesively bonded joints. This exploratory
   investigation showed the potential of AddJoining to produce
   metal-polymer layered structures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies, also called 3D printing, have
   dramatically developed over the past decade to allow new capabilities in
   materials processing with printed resolution comparable to that of
   traditional manufacturing techniques. Sequential layer deposition can
   lead to the creation of complex parts with minimized material waste,
   high manufacturing throughput, and increased prototyping ability, while
   also meeting the demand for mid- and low-volume production. The AM of
   polymer nanocomposites is a growing area of research because
   nanomaterial additives can enhance the mechanical, electrical, and other
   properties for end-use applications. However, the use of nanomaterial
   inclusions can also enhance the AM processes themselves. Here, we
   discuss works where nanomaterials are employed as local heaters for
   fused deposition modeling, as viscosifiers for direct ink writing, and
   as photothermal sensitizers for selective laser sintering and vat
   polymerization. We also note the disconnect between the researched AM
   capabilities and current industrial manufacturing; nanomaterials can
   bridge the technological gap and lead to new common practices in
   industrial manufacturing spaces.},

Title = {A Review on Residual Stress in Metal Additive Manufacturing},
Journal = {3D PRINTING AND ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 21},
Abstract = {A new method for producing parts in the expanding sector is additive
   manufacturing. The appropriate name for three-dimensional (3D) printing
   is additive manufacturing because it produces the part layer by layer.
   Plastics and metals can be 3D printed in large quantities with the
   precise surface finish and feature quality needed in additive
   manufacturing. More specifically, direct metal sintering, direct energy
   deposition, and metal binder jetting are used in 3D printing. The
   computer-aided design model is completed when the powder bed has been
   successively scanned and lowered. The metal sintering process uses a
   powder bed with powder metal, and laser selectively melts a flattened
   bed of powder, which is done with roller with successive rolling of new
   layer on previous into desired shape before a new layer is pushed on top
   of the previous layer. As a result, the new layer has solidified on top
   of the earlier layer, causing the prior layer to melt back again.
   Because of the unique thermal cycle, this results in residual stress
   (RS). The unique thermal cycle of metal additive manufacturing is
   characterized by (1) rapid heating rate caused by high energy intensity
   and steep temperature gradients; (2) rapid solidification with high
   cooling rates because of the small volume of melt pool; and (3) melt
   back, which involves simultaneous melting of the top powder layer and
   re-melting of underlying previously solidified layers. The presence of
   RS in metal additive manufacturing (AM) creates difficulties that
   restrict the process's ability to produce parts at an industrial scale.
   During and after manufacturing, these forces may cause parts to distort
   and crack. This can be solved by heating the powder bed, which will
   lessen this type of issue. The causes, traits, and reduction of RS are
   the main topics of this review article. A number of conceptual
   approaches to reducing RS are addressed to provide some useful
   inspiration for creating a methodical RS balancing procedure for AM.
   These approaches are based on the state and future of the relevant
   techniques.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing has revolutionized the
   manufacturing world through its rapid and geometrically-intricate
   capabilities as well as economic benefits. Countless businesses in
   automotive, aerospace, medical, and even food industries have adopted
   this approach over the past decade. Though this revolution has sparked
   widespread innovation with single material usage, the manufacturing
   world is constantly evolving. 3D printers now have the capability to
   create multi-material systems with performance improvements in
   user-defmable locations. This means throughout a single component,
   properties like hardness, corrosion resistance, and environmental
   adaptation can be defined in areas that require it the most. These new
   processes allow for exciting multifunctional parts to be built that were
   never possible through traditional, single material AM processes. AM of
   metals, ceramics, and polymers is currently being evaluated to combine
   multiple materials in one operation and has already produced
   never-before-produced parts. While multi-material AM is still in its
   infancy, researchers are shifting their mindset toward this unique
   approach showing that the technology is beginning to advance past a
   research and development stage into real-world applications. This review
   is intended to highlight the range of 3D printed polymer-based,
   metal-metal, and metal-ceramic applications while discussing advantages
   and challenges with additively manufactured multi-material structures.},

Title = {Production of polymer-metal hybrids using extrusion-based additive
   manufacturing and electrochemically treated aluminum},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {33},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The development towards higher individualization and functional density
   pushes the need towards a flexible production of multi-material and
   lightweight components. In this paper, extrusion based additive
   manufacturing was used to produce polymer-metal hybrids with
   polypropylene and aluminum alloy. For this purpose, a screw-driven
   extruder on a six-axis robot was used. Due to the adhesion
   incompatibility of polypropylene and untreated metals, the surface of
   the aluminum sheets was electrochemically micro-structured. The
   investigations show that this enables a mechanically stressable joint
   through the filling of the surface microstructures with polymer.
   Investigations on lap shear joints reveal a distinct influence of the
   contact temperature between the polymer and metal onto the lap shear
   strength. A sufficient contact temperature is required for filling
   surface microstructures. Thus, increased metal and extrusion
   temperatures favor higher strengths. Furthermore, the use of a
   consolidation roll shows beneficial influences in lower temperature
   ranges due to the application of higher pressures during the polymer
   strand deposition.},

Title = {An innovative digital image correlation technique for in-situ process
   monitoring of composite structures in large scale additive manufacturing},
Journal = {COMPOSITE STRUCTURES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {276},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {As additive manufacturing (AM) continues to develop and become a
   standardized manufacturing method, there will be a continued need to
   provide in-situ monitoring during the manufacturing of polymer composite
   printed components. Thermal residual stress is a primary cause of
   failures such as interlayer disbonds or delamination, micro cracking,
   and dimensional instability, which can occur during or after the build.
   This study reports a novel digital image correlation (DIC) adaptation to
   monitor thermal residual stresses during the entire print process for
   large-scale AM. In this work, DIC has been investigated (a) by the
   natural speckle produced by the polymer surface for correlation, (b) to
   monitor AM build, and (c) to evaluate the effect of thermal residual
   stress on warpage of the printed component. The natural speckle pattern
   of the AM material resulted in a respectable 3.57\% error compared to
   the traditional painted speckle pattern of 3.05\% error. DIC measured a
   190\% increase in vertical displacement at the edge of the wall compared
   to the center, indicating warpage during AM. This work is a step towards
   a non-intrusive residual stress measuring technique using DIC for
   large-scale AM.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, additive manufacturing (AM) has surpassed traditional
   machining in the realm of dawning manufacturing. In the case of
   conventional machining, where the material is removed by different
   processes (subtractive manufacturing), there is a possibility of warping
   and internal stress development. Rapid prototyping is another option to
   avoid all drawbacks of conventional machining in terms of manufacturing
   cost, time, accuracy, and quality. Rapid prototyping of a product by
   adding material (additive manufacturing) is gaining commercial traction.
   Additive manufacturing is frequently employed for the fabrication and
   bulk customization of all kinds of intricate geometrical designs that
   are absurd by traditional manufacturing techniques. Additive
   manufacturing techniques are broadly divided into four categories: (a)
   material extrusion, (b) chain polymerization, (c) laser or electron
   beamassisted sintering, and (d) direct writing-based processes. This
   article is a cutting-edge review that focuses on additive manufacturing
   processes and materials used in additive manufacturing. The process
   parameters for experimentation are chosen based on the application for
   which the part is designed. Some input process factors influence others
   for a specific response, and these critical process parameters are
   identified and optimized. This paper also gives a synopsis of failures
   associated with some additive manufacturing methods and their preventive
   actions.},

Abstract = {3D printing is a manufacturing technique where parts are built in a
   layer-by--layer fashion. The earliest embodiments were based on
   generating successive layers of solidified materials at the air liquid
   interface through exposure with actinic radiation and the lowering of
   the growing object into a vat of photoactive material. One of the
   earliest concepts was by Otto Munz in 1956 where he describes
   ``photo-glyph recording{''}. However, many today consider Charles Hull
   the father of 3D printing as it was his patent that coined the term
   ``stereolithography{''} and was the first to commercialize a 3D printing
   apparatus. Since then, there has being a multitude of technologies
   developed which fall into the category of 3D printing. While
   photochemical resin curing remains one of the most widely utilised 3D
   printing techniques, other techniques based on the extrusion of
   polymers, cutting sheets or films and thermally or chemically binding
   powdered materials have all reached the commercial markets. This chapter
   aims to give an outline of the most common polymer-based 3D printing
   techniques available today and describes some of the material and
   processing constraints which should be considered when selecting these
   systems for 3D printing of biomedical parts.},

Abstract = {The ongoing miniaturization of devices and development of wireless and
   implantable technologies demand electromagnetic interference
   (EMI)-shielding materials with customizability. Additive manufacturing
   of conductive polymer hydrogels with favorable conductivity and
   biocompatibility can offer new opportunities for EMI-shielding
   applications. However, simultaneously achieving high conductivity,
   design freedom, and shape fidelity in 3D printing of conductive polymer
   hydrogels is still very challenging. Here, an aqueous
   Ti3C2-MXene-functionalized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene
   sulfonate ink is developed for extrusion printing to create 3D objects
   with arbitrary geometries, and a freeze-thawing protocol is proposed to
   transform the printed objects directly into highly conductive and robust
   hydrogels with high shape fidelity on both the macro- and microscale.
   The as-obtained hydrogel exhibits a high conductivity of 1525.8 S m(-1)
   at water content up to 96.6 wt\% and also satisfactory mechanical
   properties with flexibility, stretchability, and fatigue resistance.
   Furthermore, the use of the printed hydrogel for customizable
   EMI-shielding applications is demonstrated. The proposed
   easy-to-manufacture approach, along with the highlighted superior
   properties, expands the potential of conductive polymer hydrogels in
   future customizable applications and represents a real breakthrough from
   the current state of the art.},

Title = {Effect of build orientation and raster pattern on the fracture behavior
   of carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites fabricated by additive
   manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {47},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) process parameters highly affect the
   mechanical and fracture properties of additively manufactured carbon
   fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites. In this work, we study the
   effect of two process parameters, including build orientation (XYZ, XZY,
   and ZXY) and raster pattern ( +/- 45 degrees and 0 degrees/90 degrees),
   on the fracture behavior of the CFRP composites fabricated by fused
   filament fabrication (FFF). The mode I fracture toughness and effective
   fracture energy of the CFRP composite materials are measured on compact
   tension samples. The crack growth direction in the FFF-fabricated CFRP
   composites is found to be controlled by both build orientation and
   raster pattern. The fracture toughness of the examined CFRP material is
   sensitive to build orientation, while the effective fracture energy
   reveals significant dependence on both build orientation and raster
   pattern. The samples fabricated with the XYZ and ZXY build orientations
   exhibit 5-fold greater effective fracture energy than the ones with the
   XZY build orientation. A wide range of fracture energy dissipation
   mechanisms, including fiber-bridging and fiber pull-out, are identified
   depending on the process parameters. The reported fracture trends in
   this study have the potential to provide guidelines for the development
   of FFFfabricated CFRP composites with high fracture resistance.},

Title = {Design for additive manufacturing process for a lightweight hydraulic
   manifold},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {36},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This article examines the process of redesigning a conventionally
   manufactured hydraulic manifold to one designed for additive
   manufacturing (DfAM). In this case, the factors to be optimized included
   minimizing the support material, and post-processing required to make
   the part, as well as minimizing the products' weight and print time.
   Improvement in product functionality would also be a desirable outcome
   of the project. The paper also compares the new and old manifold in
   terms of material usage, weight, costs, Manhattan distances, and
   residual stress.
   The DfAM process used in this article includes the steps of removing all
   material that doesn't serve a specific engineering function, exploring
   the effects of different print orientations, techniques for eliminating
   support material and post-processing. These techniques are demonstrated
   in the redesign of the hydraulic manifold and present the resulting
   printed product. The design steps used in the case study are also
   described in a generic manner to make them applicable to other AM parts
   printed in either metal or polymer.},

   review on how to improve dimensional inaccuracy and warpage},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {137},
Number = {12},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Material extrusion-based additive manufacturing (ME-AM) is an emerging
   processing technique that is characterized by the selective deposition
   of thermoplastic filaments in a layer-by-layer manner based on digital
   part models. Recently, it has attracted considerable attention, as this
   technique offers manifold benefits over conventional manufacturing
   technologies. However, to meet the challenges of complex industrial
   applications, certain shortcomings of ME-AM still need to be overcome. A
   case in point is the limited amount of semicrystalline thermoplastics,
   which are still not established as reliable, commercial filament
   materials. Particularly, polypropylene (PP) offers attractive properties
   that are unique among the ME-AM material portfolio. This review
   describes the current approaches of fabricating PP components by ME-AM.
   Both commercial and scientific strategies to make PP 3D-printable are
   elaborated and compared. As dimensional issues are especially
   problematic for PP, a comprehensive section of this review focuses on
   the strategies developed for mitigating warpage for PP parts fabricated
   by ME-AM. (c) 2019 The Authors. Journal of Applied Polymer Science

Title = {Additive manufacturing of flexible electrically conductive polymer
   composites via CNC-assisted fused layer modeling process},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN SOCIETY OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {The applications of electrically flexible conductive polymer composites
   are rapidly growing over the time due to their widespread use in
   fabrication of health monitoring devices, sensors, and flexible displays
   fabrication, etc. Various techniques have been explored to develop
   electrically conductive polymer composites. In the recent past, fused
   deposition modeling (FDM) process has been gained tremendous attention
   to fabricate electrically conductive parts considering rigid polymers
   along with conductive filler particles. This allows to avail all
   advantages and benefits of additive manufacturing in the fabrication of
   complex electrically conductive parts. However, FDM process faces
   challenges of filament buckling while fabricating flexible parts. Hence,
   there is need to develop an economically viable and simplified process
   to fabricate the flexible electrically conductive polymer composite
   objects. In the present study, fabrication of flexible electrically
   conductive polymer composite objects has been attempted by developing a
   novel CNC assisted fused layer modeling process. The developed process
   uses the material in pellet form instead of a filament, which eliminates
   the issues of filament buckling and allows flexible object fabrication.
   The ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and graphite (Gr) particles have been
   used as the polymer matrix and conductive filler material respectively.
   Solvent and melt blending techniques have been employed to develop
   EVA/Gr composites. Three-dimensional flexible electrically conductive
   objects have been fabricated successfully. The experimental result shows
   the remarkable improvements in electrical conductivity of EVA polymer by
   incorporation of graphite particles. The outcome of the presented
   approach may help to fabricate flexible electrically conductive complex
   structures for soft robotics and electronics applications.},

Abstract = {Highly filled composite feedstock in material extrusion (MatEx) additive
   manufacturing (AM) can enhance the properties of 3D printed parts.
   However, key challenges remain for highly filled composite filaments:
   (a) filament brittleness, (b) nozzle clogging, (c) rough surface finish,
   and (d) inconsistent mechanical performance due to shear -induced filler
   migration, agglomeration, and interference of interdiffusion with the
   polymer chain. In this study, we demonstrate that a highly filled
   core-shell dual-layer (DL) filament, with an acrylonitrile-butadiene-
   styrene (ABS)/calcium carbonate (CaCO3) composite core and a virgin ABS
   shell, is a feasible solution to overcome the limitations and maximize
   the advantages of composite filaments. First, we designed a coextrusion
   die with the two-dimensional (2D) finite element method (FEM) flow
   simulation to minimize interfacial flow instabilities and predict the
   interfacial position. The simulated interface agrees well with the
   experimentally measured values. Using the designed die, the highly
   filled core-shell DL filaments of up to approximately 30 wt \% (12 vol
   \%) were fabricated with precise diameters and adequate deviations. The
   parts printed using the filaments can enhance the tensile strength (22.3
   MPa), anisotropy (32\% deviation with respect to print directions), and
   visual gloss in comparison with an equivalent highly filled monolayer
   (ML) filament (15.3 MPa tensile strength and 80\% anisotropy) under the
   same printing conditions. The fractured surface and cross-sectional
   optical view of the printed parts of DLand ML filaments elucidated the
   structural and rheological benefits of DL filaments in terms of
   interlaminar bond formation.},

Abstract = {In this study, we show the extent of interfacial behaviour in the
   mechanical performance of thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer
   (TPU)/acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) composite material
   manufactured using droplet-based additive manufacturing. Both the
   interface orientation and the interface strength are varied during the
   processing. Prior to tensile experiments, X-ray micro-tomography imaging
   is undertaken to obtain the microstructural arrangement of polymer
   droplets in the part. Tensile loading is performed simultaneously with
   digital image acquisition to reveal the extent of strain localization
   using a digital image correlation approach. The experiments are
   performed up to the failure of the specimens. Finite element computation
   based on 3D imaging of the ABS/TPU composite is considered to predict
   the role of the interface as well as the defect influence on the tensile
   performance. The experimental results show a major connectivity of the
   process-generated porosity and a distinct morphology of the ABS/TPU
   interface. The predictions demonstrate that, despite the limited amount
   of porosity, their connectivity plays a significant role in triggering
   damage initiation and growth up to the failure of the composite
   material.},

   Biomaterials Used in Bone Tissue Engineering},
Journal = {POLYMERS},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {With the ability to fabricate complex structures while meeting
   individual needs, additive manufacturing (AM) offers unprecedented
   opportunities for bone tissue engineering in the biomedical field.
   However, traditional metal implants have many adverse effects due to
   their poor integration with host tissues, and therefore new material
   implants with porous structures are gradually being developed that are
   suitable for clinical medical applications. From the perspectives of
   additive manufacturing technology and materials, this article discusses
   a suitable manufacturing process for ideal materials for biological bone
   tissue engineering. It begins with a review of the methods and
   applicable materials in existing additive manufacturing technologies and
   their applications in biomedicine, introducing the advantages and
   disadvantages of various AM technologies. The properties of materials
   including metals and polymers, commonly used AM technologies, recent
   developments, and their applications in bone tissue engineering are
   discussed in detail and summarized. In addition, the main challenges for
   different metallic and polymer materials, such as biodegradability,
   anisotropy, growth factors to promote the osteogenic capacity, and
   enhancement of mechanical properties are also introduced. Finally, the
   development prospects for AM technologies and biomaterials in bone
   tissue engineering are considered.},

Title = {Effects of Friction Stir Welding on the Mechanical Behaviors of
   Extrusion-Based Additive Manufactured Polymer Parts},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The friction stir welding (FSW) of thermoplastic polymers is gradually
   receiving attention because of its advantages including high efficiency
   and pollution-free manufacturing. The extrusion-based additive
   manufacturing (EAM) of polymers has also become one of the main
   processing methods for thermoplastic parts. In this paper, a hybrid
   manufacturing method for the FSW process and EAM technology is proposed
   and explored. The effects of the FSW process using two different welding
   tools on the mechanical behaviors of 3D printing polymer parts were
   compared and investigated and the corresponding mechanism was analyzed.
   The results show that the appropriate welding tool is beneficial for
   eliminating the anisotropy and decreasing the porosity of 3D-printed
   parts. Therefore, the improving effects of the FSW process on the
   mechanical behaviors of the EAM parts are verified. The mechanism was
   attributed to the high-speed rotation of the welding tool with the
   appropriate shape, which can promote the flow of polymer melt in the
   welding region, leading to the formation of dense structures caused by
   the entanglement of the molecular chains. This study may provide some
   assistance in modern industrial manufacturing for the processing of
   large custom components.},

Abstract = {Polymer-based multimaterial additive manufacturing (AM) has developed
   into one of the most promising technologies of recent times. A
   processing concept was developed in previous studies, which targets the
   implementation of reactive liquids in a thermoplastic powder-bed for the
   creation of multimaterial polymer composite parts. This process aims to
   be the first AM process of its kind to fully utilize the potentials of
   both thermoplastic and thermoset polymers simultaneously. A highly
   important aspect for this process is the investigation of the
   infiltration behavior of the reactive liquids within the powder bed,
   since premature or delayed curing of the liquids could lead to
   deviations from the intended geometry as well as process errors due to
   material protrusions. This investigation presents an experimental and a
   mathematical approach to describe and predict the time which a droplet
   needs to completely infiltrate the powder bed. The results showed, that
   the experimental setup is viable to observe the droplet height over time
   at temperatures of up to 105 degrees C and infiltration times below 500
   ms. The mathematical model proved to be a powerful approximation to
   describe the infiltration behavior of a reactive liquid within a
   thermoplastic powder bed once a material-specific form factor is
   determined for each powder material. Through the process of elimination,
   the independence of the form factor was demonstrated for different
   powder parameters like the particle size. A theory is presented, which
   correlates the form factor to the microstructural shape and surface
   condition of the particles based on SEM images.},

Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2019},

Pages = {61-71},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Multi-material additive manufacturing enables high-performance
   heterogeneous design at the mesoscale, through which bulk parts can be
   engineered to adapt to complex loading conditions. The optimization of
   multi-material parts relies on accurate forward prediction, which is
   challenging to achieve owing to the complex processing conditions in
   additive manufacturing and the resultant uncertainties in material
   properties. To address these limitations, here we present a new model
   calibration and model selection framework based on the high dimensional,
   local-scale deformation data. By matching the pixel-level deformation
   data from digital image correlation experiments and constitutive
   modeling, the presented framework enables more accurate prediction and
   significant reduction of the prediction uncertainties, as compared to
   the single material calibration approach that is widely used in additive
   manufacturing. In turn, this enables quantitative comparison of the
   candidate models, so the most accurate and computationally efficient
   constitutive model can be selected for forward prediction in
   heterogeneous material design. The advantages of the framework are
   demonstrated using a multi-polymer system manufactured by dual-extrusion
   additive manufacturing, which consists of two constituent materials with
   dramatically different deformation behaviors.},

Abstract = {Polyphthalocyanine polymer films are deposited on additive manufactured

   more positive corrosion potential compared to the uncoated sample
   indicating improved corrosion protection. XPS studies probed the bonding
   properties between the coating and additive manufactured metal surface.

Abstract = {Many industrial and research applications benefit from laser beam
   profiles which are non-Gaussian but rather tailored to that specific
   application. For example, shaping the beam profile and footprint holds
   great potential for beam delivery in laser-assisted manufacturing
   processes. In particular, top hat beam profiles of different shapes and
   size would enable speeding up additive manufacturing while increasing
   the resolution of the 3D printed parts. In this paper, we present the
   design of different beam shapers for high power CO2 lasers used in laser
   sintering, which are able to generate respectively square and circular
   top hat beam profiles. The size of the spot is controlled by using
   additional lenses to reduce or enlarge the beam size as necessary after
   the beam shaping optics. A spot size of 0.5 mm or 5 mm diameter can be
   achieved by switching between different lenses and adjust the distances
   accordingly. The designed beam shaping optics were subsequently
   fabricated in-house using ultra-precision diamond tooling in zinc
   sulfide material which is tolerant to high laser power and transparent
   at a wavelength of 10.6 mu m. This beam shaping optics can form the
   basis for dynamic beam shaping in which the spot size, spot shape and/or
   intensity profile can be actively controlled by moving the optical
   components in the laser beam path.},

Abstract = {Next-generation additive manufacturing processes based on UV-curing
   acrylate photopolymers extend the barriers of functional part production
   by deploying rapid processing speeds, complex geometries with high
   resolutions, and an extended material spectrum. Many technologies
   introduce temperature-dependent curing and decomposition behavior of
   acrylates to the list of process-related challenges. This investigation
   targets a comprehensive analysis of the curing behavior and thermal
   stability of acrylic photopolymers by implementing analyzing techniques
   like thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier-transform infrared
   spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. Significant
   parameters such as the UV intensity and the isothermal temperature are
   varied based on the design of experiments. Characteristic evolving gases
   at elevated temperatures are identified and discussed towards their
   relevance for the curing process. The calorimetric results demonstrate
   increasing reaction speeds with elevated UV intensities as well as a
   restricted accelerating effect of increasing temperatures. The reaction
   enthalpy proves to be strongly dependent on the chosen temperature. The
   results represent the base for the comparison of different kinetic
   curing models in future investigations.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a name for techniques applied for
   constructing three-dimensional (3D) objects in a layer-by-layer process.
   AM methods can be applied for creating elements from polymers without
   and with reinforcing fibers. During the process, fiber Bragg grating
   (FBG) sensors can be embedded into the element structure for the purpose
   of structural health monitoring (SHM) system development. Such an
   approach combines in one, advantages of AM (limited waste, elements with
   complex shape) and SHM system (safety, information about real loading
   conditions). Such a method can be applied for the manufacturing of
   different elements applied in many branches of industry, e.g. marine or
   civil engineering.
   The goal of the paper is to analyze the possibility of FBG sensors
   embedding into an AM polymeric elements without and with carbon fiber
   reinforcement. The analyzes are focused on the influence of the
   manufacturing process on FBG sensors (both spectrum and strain).
   Additionally, the influence of temperature (both elevated and sub-zero)
   on the finished AM elements was be investigated.},

Title = {Investigating the Mechanical Properties of Polymer Samples from
   Different Additive Manufacturing Processes Using Ultrasonic Phase
   Spectroscopy},
Journal = {3D PRINTING AND ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 9},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing processes have recently been used more frequently
   since they offer high design freedom and easy individualization of
   components. The processes have been optimized to improve mechanical
   performance of the manufactured parts. Nevertheless, properties of
   components made by means of injection molding could not be reached yet.
   In the study at hand, ultrasonic phase spectroscopy (UPS) is used to
   compare the elastic properties of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
   specimens manufactured by injection molding, by fused filament
   fabrication, and the Arburg plastic freeforming process. UPS allows a
   nondestructive and prompt determination of the elastic modulus and
   allows evaluation of the mechanical properties in every direction in
   space. In the end, results of UPS are compared with properties derived
   by uniaxial tensile tests to validate UPS as a test method for the
   determination of the mechanical properties of polymers. Regardless of
   the manufacturing process, an approximately linear dependence of the
   elastic moduli on the density can be determined. Furthermore, the
   quasistatic properties of the injection molded samples consistently
   exhibit the mechanical properties of the other samples by at least 10\%.},

Title = {Cellulose derivative for biodegradable and large-scalable 2D nano
   additive manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {74},
Month = {JUL 25},
Abstract = {Two-photon lithography (TPL) has been continuously improved and employed
   in versatile additive manufacturing for decades. Unfortunately,
   large-scale 2D nano additive manufacturing via TPL remains challenging
   due to the lack of suitable solid two-photon photoresists (TPPs).
   Although some commercial solid UV photoresists have been reported for
   TPL application, their slow two-photon adsorption results in
   insufficient sensitivity and unsatisfactory critical dimension (CD).
   More importantly, commercial photoresists are compli-cated to
   synthesize, difficult to biodegrade, and will pose a pollution risk to
   environment. In this work, cellulose derivative, a natural bio-polymer,
   is introduced to form a biodegradable solid TPP (Cel-STPP-x) for TPL.
   The preeminent photo-sensitivity and two-color photo-sensitivity allow
   Cel-STPP-x to have a considerable writing speed (2.43 m s\_ 1) and a
   remarkable CD (42 nm), which are superior to the majority of reported
   TPPs. Subse-quently, a 1-inch silica-based grating is created through
   TPL, etching, and stripping, indicating that Cel-STPP-x may be employed
   not only for large-scale nano additive manufacturing but also for
   pattern transfer, which is critical for producing diverse micro devices.
   Besides, the used Cel-STPP-x can be rapidly decomposed in soil. Overall,
   this work may pave the way for TPL towards sustainable and large-scale
   2D nano additive manufacturing.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The use of additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, has progressed beyond
   prototyping to produce intricate and valuable finished goods. The
   potential of additive manufacturing has increased across numerous
   industries due to the expansion of materials, such as high-performance
   metals and polymers, and advancements in machine capabilities, such as
   multi-material printing. By enabling complex designs, reduced waste, and
   quick production, it has the potential to revolutionize the consumer
   goods, healthcare, automotive manufacturing, and aerospace industries.
   The development of specialized scaffolds has been made possible by the
   precise control that additive manufacturing provides over the internal
   structure of porous materials. This technology has revolutionized tissue
   engineering and regenerative medicine. Furthermore, it has made it
   possible to create individualized implants and prosthetics that improve
   patient comfort and outcomes in orthopedic and dental applications.
   Also, it provides flexibility in design and customization for
   individualized implants and prosthetics in orthopedic and dental
   applications. Design flexibility, waste reduction, improved
   biocompatibility, quick prototyping, and cost-effectiveness are benefits
   of additive manufacturing for implants. For personalized healthcare,
   regenerative medicine, and better patient outcomes, additive
   manufacturing holds promise as the technology develops with further
   advancements in printing speed, resolution, and scalability.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the shape memory
   properties of SMP samples produced through a MEAM process. Fused
   deposition modeling or, as it will be referred to in this paper,
   material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEAM) is a technique in which
   polymeric materials are extruded though a nozzle creating parts via
   accumulation and joining of different layers. These layers are fused
   together to build three-dimensional objects. Shape memory polymers (SMP)
   are stimulus responsive materials, which have the ability to recover
   their pre-programmed form after being exposed to a large strain. To
   induce its shape memory recovery movement, an external stimulus such as
   heat needs to be applied. Design/methodology/approach This project
   investigates and characterizes the influence of print orientation and
   infill percentage on shape recovery properties. The analyzed shape
   recovery properties are shape recovery force, shape recovery speed and
   time elapsed before activation. To determine whether the analyzed
   factors produce a significant variation on shape recovery
   properties,t-tests were performed with a 95\% confidence factor between
   each analyzed level. Findings Results proved that print angle and infill
   percentage do have a significant impact on recovery properties of the
   manufactured specimens. Originality/value The manufacturing of SMP
   objects through a MEAM process has a vast potential for different
   applications; however, the shape recovery properties of these objects
   need to be analyzed before any practical use can be developed. These
   have not been studied as a function of print parameters, which is the
   focus of this study.},

Abstract = {Silicone resins, filled with phosphates and other oxide fillers, yield
   upon firing in air at 1100 degrees C, a product resembling Biosilicate
   (R) glass-ceramics, one of the most promising systems for tissue
   engineering applications. The process requires no preliminary synthesis
   of parent glass, and the polymer route enables the application of direct
   ink writing (DIW) of silicone-based mixtures, for the manufacturing of
   reticulated scaffolds at room temperature. The thermal treatment is
   later applied for the conversion into ceramic scaffolds. The present
   paper further elucidates the flexibility of the approach. Changes in the
   reference silicone and firing atmosphere (from air to nitrogen) were
   studied to obtain functional composite biomaterials featuring a carbon
   phase embedded in a Biosilicate (R)-like matrix. The microstructure was
   further modified either through a controlled gas release at a low
   temperature, or by the revision of the adopted additive manufacturing
   technology (from DIW to digital light processing).},

Title = {A novel higher-order finite element framework for the process modeling
   of material extrusion additive manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {76},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Material extrusion additive manufacturing enables the rapid fabrication
   of complex structures for a wide range of applications, including within
   the aerospace and healthcare sectors. Optimizing the performance of
   additively manufactured polymer structures depends on the ability to
   predict residual stress induced by the sequential solidification of the
   extruded layers. Self-equilibrated residual stresses are influenced by
   the thermal history of the part during the manufacturing process. This
   work introduces a novel numerical framework for the process modeling of
   material extrusion additive manufacturing. The numerical modeling is
   based on higher -order finite elements derived from the Carrera Unified
   Formulation (CUF), which enables accurate prediction of the stress field
   while reducing the associated computational overheads. Element
   activation is adopted to model the evolving structure during material
   extrusion and deposition. Heat exchange mechanisms such as conduction
   (filament/filament, filament/build platform), convection, and radiation
   are included in the model. A transient thermal analysis is performed in
   this new framework to predict the temperature distribution within the
   part during its fabrication. Multiple numerical assessments are
   presented for the material extrusion additive manufacturing of parts
   ranging in size from 30 mm to over 1500 mm. The predicted thermal
   profiles are in excellent agreement with reference experimental
   observations, thereby validating the proposed numerical framework and
   demonstrating its capability to model the printing process accurately.
   Results from this work are a milestone toward optimizing additively
   manufactured polymer parts.},

Abstract = {The materials for additive manufacturing (AM) technology have grown
   substantially over the last few years to fulfill industrial needs.
   Despite that, the use of bio-based composites for improved mechanical
   properties and biodegradation is still not fully explored. This limits
   the universal expansion of AM-fabricated products due to the
   incompatibility of the products made from petroleum-derived resources.
   The development of naturally-derived polymers for AM materials is
   promising with the increasing number of studies in recent years owing to
   their biodegradation and biocompatibility. Cellulose is the most
   abundant biopolymer that possesses many favorable properties to be
   incorporated into AM materials, which have been continuously focused on
   in recent years. This critical review discusses the development of AM
   technologies and materials, cellulose-based polymers, cellulose-based
   three-dimensional (3D) printing filaments, liquid deposition modeling of
   cellulose, and four-dimensional (4D) printing of cellulose-based
   materials. Cellulose-based AM material applications and the limitations
   with future developments are also reviewed.},

Journal = {MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The ability to additively-manufacture mechanically responsive molecules,
   known as mechanophores (MPs), that are incorporated into polymer
   feedstocks provides opportunities for self-healing,real-time damage
   detection, and improvements in quality assurance and control
   capabilities to several industries (wind energy technology, building and
   construction, etc.) who are adopting additive manufacturing (AM).
   However, before the applica-tions are realized and industrially adopted,
   further research and development regarding MP-incorporated AM feedstock
   availability, production scale-up, and processability and printability
   is needed. The goal of this review is to bridge the gap between the
   bench top and real world applications of AM of MPs by identifying high
   impact application spaces and highlighting the challenges that need to
   be overcome for widespread adoption. Here, the state-of-the-art of AM of
   MP-incorporated feedstocks is reviewed, followed by a discussion of
   potential future applications, current challenges, and research areas
   that work toward commercialization of AM of MP -incorporated feedstocks.},

Abstract = {This work presents the design, fabrication and measurements of
   third-order multilayered filters by additive manufacturing technology.
   The filters are fabricated using conventional half-wavelength line
   resonators and a low-cost 3d polylactic acid polymer additive
   manufacturing process, which allows rapid prototyping and fabrication of
   complex topologies. The designs, performed at a centre frequency of 2.0
   GHz, aim to provide fast manufacturing and get enhanced performances
   when compared to conventional coupled line third order filters using

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing technology as revolutionary manufacturing
   technology has attracted much attention. This technology transformed
   traditional processing design and manufacturing concepts and promoted
   the development of intelligent manufacturing. Intelligent material is a
   kind of material that has the ability of self-perception, autonomous
   response, self-healing and adaptation. The combination of intelligent
   materials and additive manufacturing technology can realize the
   integrated manufacturing of three-dimensional smart devices with the
   ability to sense external stimuli or environmental activation. This
   technology has been widely used in fields such as biomedical devices,
   flexible electronics, soft robotics, and other fields. Additive
   manufactured intelligent materials, and the advantages and problems of
   additive manufactured intelligent materials of metals, polymers, and
   ceramics were reviewed. As a technical means to realize the organic
   integration of design, material and structure, additive manufacturing
   technology will become the key to promote the development of intelligent
   materials.},

Title = {Radiative Thermal Effects in Large Scale Additive Manufacturing of
   Polymers: Numerical and Experimental Investigations},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The present paper addresses experimental and numerical investigations of
   a Large Scale Additive Manufacturing (LSAM) process using polymers. By
   producing large components without geometrical constraints quickly and
   economically, LSAM processes have the capability to revolutionize many
   industries. Accurate prediction and control of the thermal history is
   key for a successful manufacturing process and for achieving high
   quality and good mechanical properties of the manufactured part. During
   the LSAM process, the heat emitted by the nozzle leads to an increase in
   the temperature of the previously deposited layer, which prepares the
   surface for better adhesion of the new layer. It is therefore necessary
   to take into account this part of heat source in the transient heat
   transfer equation to correctly and completely describe the process and
   predict the temperature field of the manufactured part. The present
   study contributes to experimental investigations and numerical analysis
   during the LSAM process. During the process, two types of measurements
   are performed: firstly, the heat emitted by the nozzle is measured via a
   radiative heat sensor; secondly, the temperature field is measured using
   an infrared camera while varying the process speed. At the same time, a
   numerical simulation model is developed in order to validate the
   experimental results. The temperature fields of the manufactured parts
   computed by numerical simulations are in very good agreement with the
   temperature fields measured by infrared thermograph with the
   contribution of the nozzle's heat exchange.},

Abstract = {Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs) are a promising alternative to
   conventional anorganic semiconductor devices. Especially in terms of
   manufacturing, new technologies promise a variety of new opportunities.
   3D printing processes are able to deposit functional materials on
   additive manufactured surfaces with simultaneously low material
   consumption. Furthermore, this may be implemented in conventional 3D
   printing to achieve a functional process. With this technology it is for
   example possible to manufacture a fully additive manufactured
   illumination system, based on polymer OLEDs. We use solvable functional
   inks for each semiconductor layer, which are ready to use in inkjet
   printing systems. Here we present the transfer from commonly used
   anorganic ITO (indium tin oxide) to an inkjet printed, transparent anode
   on an additive manufactured resin substrate. In addition, we discuss the
   3D printing technologies involved in the manufacturing process as well
   as the geometrical layer design and contacting methods used. Challenges
   here by are the surface quality and wetting properties of the substrate
   surface and each individual layer. We evaluate our results by the
   electrical and optical characteristics. Additionally we discuss
   manufacturing parameters and their effect on the device functionality.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) affords the opportunity to print tailored
   pharmaceuticals to customize the quantity of medicine, number of
   medicines, and time and rate of release to be adapted for an
   individual's needs. A series of sulfonated poly(ethylene glycol) (SPEG)
   polymers for fused filament fabrication (FFF) that (i) dissolves quickly
   ( < 3.0 mg/min) and (ii) can be printed at a low temperature of 70
   degrees C, thus enabling the incorporation of active ingredients have
   previously been reported. In this work, the effect of incorporating
   different counterions into the SPEG polymer on printability was
   investigated. Material properties were measured and feature specimens
   were printed to qualitatively analyze the effects of the material
   properties on the printability of the polymers containing each
   counterion. The SPEG containing Ca2+ counterions permitted the
   fabrication of the most accurate printed parts without warping, with
   defined roads, and the ability to cross a gap which all result from a
   high viscosity, low volumetric shrinkage, and < 10 mu m crystal size.
   This work demonstrates the ability to tune the molecular structure of an
   ionic polymer by changing the counterion to create a novel and
   functional polymer for FFF.},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The conventional manufacturing methods for fabricating orthotic and
   prosthetic (O\&P) devices have been in practice for a very long time.
   Recently, O\&P service providers have started exploring different
   advanced manufacturing techniques. The objective of this paper is to
   perform a mini review on recent progress in the use of polymer-based
   additive manufacturing (AM) for O\&P devices and to gather insights from
   the O\&P professionals on the current practices and technologies and on
   the prospect of using AM techniques in this field. In our study, first,
   scientific articles on AM for O\&P devices were studied. Then,
   twenty-two (22) interviews were conducted with O\&P professionals from
   Canada. The primary focus was on five key areas: cost, material, design
   and fabrication efficiency, structural strength, functionality, and
   patient satisfaction. The cost of manufacturing the O\&P devices using
   AM techniques is lower as compared to the conventional methods. O\&P
   professionals expressed their concern over the materials and structural
   strength of the 3D-printed prosthetic devices. Published articles report
   comparable functionality and patient satisfaction for both O\&P devices.
   AM also greatly improves design and fabrication efficiency. However, due
   to a lack of qualification standards for 3D printed O\&P devices, 3D
   printing is being embraced more slowly in the O\&P business than in
   other industries.},

Abstract = {To advance the capabilities of additive manufacturing, novel resin
   formulations are needed that produce high-fidelity parts with desired
   mechanical properties that are also amenable to recycling. In this work,
   a thiol-ene-based system incorporating semicrystallinity and dynamic
   thioester bonds within polymer networks is presented. It is shown that
   these materials have ultimate toughness values >16 MJ cm(-3), comparable
   to high-performance literature precedents. Significantly, the treatment
   of these networks with excess thiols facilitates thiol-thioester
   exchange that degrades polymerized networks into functional oligomers.
   These oligomers are shown to be amenable to repolymerization into
   constructs with varying thermomechanical properties, including
   elastomeric networks that recover their shape fully from >100\% strain.
   Using a commercial stereolithographic printer, these resin formulations
   are printed into functional objects including both stiff (E similar to
   10-100 MPa) and soft (E similar to 1-10 MPa) lattice structures.
   Finally, it is shown that the incorporation of both dynamic chemistry
   and crystallinity further enables advancement in the properties and
   characteristics of printed parts, including attributes such as
   self-healing and shape-memory.},

   attractive for material extrusion based additive manufacturing (MEX-AM),
   earlier called fused deposition modeling (FDM). Fabrication of bulk
   polymer derived ceramics is challenging due to gas evolution during
   crosslinking leading to pores and cracks in final product. Mixture of
   ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was
   successfully used to generate open porosity before crosslinking step.
   For 3D printing, a pellet extruder was used and a PVA binder content of
   50 vol\% was essential for succcessful solvent debinding process in
   water. The effect of PVA content and different EVA grades on
   printability and debinding behavior was studied. EVA with a lower melt
   flow index (MFI) showed better compatibility with PVA additive in terms
   of mixing and printing. EVA with higher vinyl acetate content seems to
   be more favorable for later thermal debinding processes because of its
   higher gas permeability.},

Abstract = {The dawn of mainstream electric vehicles is here, with almost all major
   automotive manufacturers now offering fully electric alternatives to
   traditional internal combustion-based cars. This is in alignment with
   major trends in sustainability in today's world where a reduction in the
   usage of fossil fuels and other fossil fuel-dependent technologies is
   being realized. Additive Manufacturing technologies that have in the
   past been driven by the automotive industry, now present an opportunity
   for the automotive sector, where greater gains and benefits can be made
   by its adoption. Additively manufactured parts enable complex optimized
   design and also promote material efficiency. Moreover, system wide
   benefits in terms of streamlined supply chains and logistics operations
   are also possible and promised. This manuscript presents these benefits,
   the reason for the growing interests and an outlook for the future of
   integrated, metal- and polymer-based, additive manufacturing within
   traditional automotive manufacturing process chains.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing vat polymerization has become a leading
   technology and gained a massive amount of attention in industrial
   applications such as injection molding inserts. By the use of the
   thermoset polymerization process inserts have increased their market
   share. For most industrial applications, strength and stiffness are
   crucial factors to a successful implementation of cured photopolymer
   thermosets. Hence, fiber-reinforced polymers have recently been
   introduced.
   The behavior and especially orientation of fibers during the vat
   photopolymerization process has yet not been fully understood. Research
   indicates an orientation within the manufacturing layer and efforts have
   been made to achieve a more uniform orientation within the part. A vat
   polymerization machine consisting of a resin vat and a moving build
   plate has been simulated using the fluid flow module of Comsol
   Multiphysics (TM). A moving mesh with hyper-elastic behavior was
   utilized to simulate the flow of the photopolymer during the lifting of
   the build plate after a successful curing of a single layer.
   The velocity profile can thereafter be used to estimate a prediction for
   the orientation of the short fibers added to the liquid photopolymer
   resin. The prediction can be used to identify potential clusters or
   misalignment of fibers and in the future allow for optimization of the
   machine design and manufacturing process.},

Abstract = {Plastic additives are a diverse group of specialty chemicals that are
   used to manufacture polymers (polymerization aids like initiators,
   surfactants and protective colloids) or are incorporated into the
   plastic product prior to or during processing. They may become part of
   the polymer network (like initiators do) or remain without a chemical
   linkage to the polymer. Additives aid in the processing of the polymer
   and in the manufacture of the plastic end product (lubricants,
   plasticizers) or improve characteristics and performance of the final
   product (flame retardants, antistatic agents, impact modifiers, and
   heat/light stabilizers). Additive manufacturers are faced with the
   imperative to develop products that not only enhance the overall
   processability and functionality of the plastic end products, but to
   satisfy environmental and health demands as well. Additives are
   regulated by national or international authorities in order to protect
   consumers, when leaching or extraction from elastomeric or plastic
   components or from a coating film occurs or when volatilization into the
   environment may happen.},

Journal = {POLYMERS},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are stimuli-responsive materials, which are
   able to retain an imposed, temporary shape and recover the initial,
   permanent shape through an external stimulus like heat. In this work, a
   novel manufacturing method is introduced for thermoresponsive quick
   response (QR) code carriers, which originally were developed as
   anticounterfeiting technology. Motivated by the fact that earlier
   manufacturing processes were sometimes too time-consuming for
   production, filaments of a polyester urethane (PEU) with and without dye
   were extruded and processed into QR code carriers using fused filament
   fabrication (FFF). Once programmed, the distinct shape memory properties
   enabled a heating-initiated switching from non-decodable to
   machine-readable QR codes. The results demonstrate that FFF constitutes
   a promising additive manufacturing technology to create complex,
   filigree structures with adjustable horizontal and vertical print
   resolution and, thus, an excellent basis to realize further technically
   demanding application concepts for shape memory polymers.},

Abstract = {In this study, carbon nanotube (CNT) reinforced functionally graded
   bioactive glass scaffolds have been fabricated using additive

   ink carrier. The CNT-reinforced scaffolds were coated with the polymer
   polycaprolactone (PCL) using dip-coating method to improve their
   properties further by sealing the micro-cracks. The CNT- reinforcement
   and polymer coating resulted in an improvement in the compressive
   strength of the additively manufactured scaffolds by 98\% in comparison
   to pure bioactive glass scaffolds. Further, the morphological analysis
   revealed interconnected pores and their size appropriate for
   osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Evaluation of the in vitro bioactivity of
   the scaffolds after immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF) confirmed
   the formation of hydroxyapatite (HA). Further, the cellular studies

   manufacturing of engineering thermoplastic polymers},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The strengths of additive manufacturing (AM), especially the tool-less
   manufacturing paradigm and rapid pro-duction of low-volume products, are
   well-aligned with the needs of manufacturing of expensive,
   high-tem-perature resistant, engineering thermoplastic polymers. High
   temperature polymer parts made with AM for either tooling or end-use
   applications have been implemented in the aerospace, automotive, and
   biomedical fields. However, parts made from these polymers using
   traditional manufacturing processes are generally high-value parts in
   low-quantity production runs. Moreover, AM processing of these polymers
   present significant challenges due to limitations associated with large
   thermal gradients, residual stress buildup, and interlayer adhesion as
   well as the inability of the printers to consistently maintain required
   high processing temperatures. This review highlights the current state
   of the art for processing high-temperature (i.e., traditional processing
   temperatures exceeding 250 degrees C) thermoplastic polymers by the
   melt-based, AM processes of material extrusion (MatEx) and laser powder
   bed fusion (PBF). The authors address common challenges to AM of
   high-temperature polymers and gaps in fundamental understanding of the
   process-structure-property relationships needed to identify the machine
   design, process parameter selection, and synthetic modifications to
   enable processing.},

Abstract = {This work aims to present a global view of additive manufacturing,
   focused in biomedical area. With the evolution of technology, there has
   been an increasing demand for customized products, which has intensified
   the need for alternative manufacturing techniques. Additive
   manufacturing (AM) consists in the development of physical models
   through the deposition of layer-by-layer material from three-dimensional
   virtual models. About three decades ago, Fusion Deposition Modeling
   (FDM) technology was developed. FDM is an AM material extrusion
   technology, in which the material used is extruded by a nozzle. FDM has
   been growing, as well as the equipment and software involved, to broad
   applications in the field of biomedical engineering, such as the
   development of personalized and functional medical devices (including
   stents). This study presents the state of the art of 3D printing and
   additive manufacturing, as well as their techniques, obstacles and
   innovations. In addition, a stent was developed through a CAD software
   and it was manufactured through a 3D FDM printer using PLA.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing techniques for ultraviolet (UV) curable silicones
   are investigated using a high-pressure extrusion apparatus.
   Manufacturing challenges encountered include the silicone slumping under
   its own weight, electrostatic repulsion between the printed part and the
   extrudate, clogging due to in-nozzle UV curing, and nozzle material
   accumulation. One of the silicones tested significantly slumped under
   its own weight and had a height decrease of 25\% over 60 s if not in
   situ cured. Repulsion effects were observed due to tribocharging of the
   silicone and the UV curing process. Carbon black (CB) was added to the
   silicone to minimize repulsion effects, alleviate in-nozzle curing, and
   nozzle material accumulation. Durometer and tensile testing were used to
   compare mechanical properties of the silicone under different CB loading
   conditions. Higher loadings of CB abated repulsion effects and also
   significantly reduced the durometer and 100\% secant modulus of
   elasticity of ASTM D638 Type 1 dogbone printed parts due to inhibition
   of UV curing depth. Postoven curing of samples increased the durometer
   and modulus of all samples tested. It was found that 0.15 wt\% CB was
   optimal to reduce repulsion effects and to maintain durometer and secant
   modulus within -2.6\% and -1.3\% of bulk cast properties, respectively.},

Abstract = {Development in additive manufacturing is exceptionally rapid than the
   expected forecast so far and it has traced out new dimensions in
   engineering applications. 3D printing technology becomes more glamorous
   when Skylar Tibbits incorporated the concept of ``Time{''} as a fourth
   dimension by encapsulating smart materials in current additive
   manufacturing technique. Materials having an explicit response to
   external stimuli over a certain time span are designated as smart
   materials and additive manufacturing of such time-dependent,
   programmable, and intelligent materials is termed as 4D printing. In 4D
   printing, primary 3D printed configuration switched exclusively into a
   transformed shape when exposed to an external stimuli, e.g. heat, light,
   water, chemical, electric current, magnetic field or pH. Perhaps,
   additive manufacturing technology seems to be superseded exclusively by
   this modern technology in forthcoming years, and much effort is
   demanding from every discipline to actualize this technology. A
   task-oriented entire landscape of 4D printing followed by a
   comprehensive smart material perspective is presented in this review.
   Graphical abstract set forth a route to the complete process
   comprehension. Moreover, other components of 4D technology like
   customary techniques, computational challenges, reversibility and
   current stature of 4D printing are probed through recent experimental
   and theoretical literature. Finally, potential applications of 4D
   printing are summarised with promising research directions and outlook.

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing is the process of creating an object from a
   digital three-dimensional (3D) design using hardware that deposits and
   adds materials successively until the desired object is formed. Vat
   polymerization is a type of additive manufacturing technique that offers
   an attractive strategy for fabricating 3D objects due to its high
   resolution, versatility of feedstock materials, and high dimensional
   accuracy. However, the ability to spatially control the placement of
   multiple materials during vat polymerization is limited by mechanical
   designs that can restrict printing to a single photocurable resin,
   making it difficult to create complex geometries with embedded
   functionality. In this review, we highlight work-arounds that have been
   employed, such as manually switching resins, as well as two key areas of
   innovation: mechanical hardware design and the chemistry of materials.
   These methods include systems which automatically switch resin vats,
   volumetric additive manufacturing which overprints a secondary 3D
   structure on top of an existing object, and specially formulated, unique
   material chemistries, such as those which enable dual wavelength light
   to initiate orthogonal chemistry mechanisms, control of the degree of
   cross-linking with variation in light parameters, and phase separation
   of functional materials. Perspectives on the interplay of printer type
   and material chemistry, the constraints they impose on one another, and
   the future of multimaterial vat polymerization are described. In order
   for vat polymerization to emerge as a viable technology for
   multimaterial additive manufacturing, both mechanical hardware design
   and chemistry of materials must be codeveloped.},

Abstract = {Wet-spinning of polymeric materials has been widely investigated for
   various biomedical applications, such as extracorporeal blood treatment,
   controlled drug release and tissue engineering. This review is aimed at
   summarizing and assessing current advances in wet-spinning of biomedical
   polymers to manufacture single fibres and three-dimensional scaffolds,
   as well as their functionalization through loading with bioactive
   agents. The theoretical principles and the main technological aspects of
   fibre production by wet-spinning on either a laboratory or an industrial
   scale are outlined. The non-solvent-induced phase inversion determining
   polymer coagulation during the wet-spinning process is discussed by
   highlighting its influence on the resulting fibre morphology and how it
   can be exploited to induce a nano/microporosity in the solidified
   polymeric matrix. The versatility of wet-spinning in material selection,
   bioactive agent loading and fibre morphology tuning is underlined
   through an overview of significant literature reporting on the
   processing of various naturally derived and synthetic polymers. A
   special focus is given to cutting-edge advancements in the application
   of additive manufacturing principles to wet-spinning for enhanced
   control and reproducibility of three-dimensional polymeric scaffold
   morphology at different scale levels (i.e. macrostructural to
   micro/nanostructural features). (c) 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

Abstract = {Hydrogel has become a commonly used material for 3D and 4D printing due
   to its favorable biocompatibility and low cost. Additive manufacturing,
   also known as 3D printing, was originally referred to as rapid
   prototyping manufacturing. Variable-feature rapid prototyping
   technology, also known as 4D printing, is a combination of materials,
   mathematics, and additives. This study constitutes a literature review
   to address hydrogel-based additive manufacturing technologies,
   introducing the characteristics of commonly used 3D printing hydrogel
   methods, such as direct ink writing, fused deposition modeling, and
   stereolithography. With this review, we also investigated the stimulus
   types, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of various
   stimulus-responsive hydrogels in smart hydrogels; non-responsive
   hydrogels; and various applications of additive manufacturing hydrogels,
   such as neural catheter preparation and drug delivery. The

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as three-dimensional (3D)
   printing, has boomed over the last 30 years, and its use has accelerated
   during the last 5 years. AM is a materials-oriented manufacturing
   technology, and printing resolution versus printing scalability/speed
   trade-off exists among various types of materials, including polymers,
   metals, ceramics, glasses, and composite materials. Four-dimensional
   (4D) printing, together with versatile transformation systems, drives
   researchers to achieve and utilize high dimensional AM. Multiple
   perspectives of the AM of structural materials have been raised and
   illustrated in this review, including multimaterial AM (MMa-AM),
   multi-modulus AM (MMo-AM), multi-scale AM (MSc-AM), multi-system AM
   (MSyAM), multi-dimensional AM (MD-AM), and multi-function AM (MF-AM).
   The rapid and tremendous development of AM materials and methods offers
   great potential for structural applications, such as in the aerospace
   field, the biomedical field, electronic devices, nuclear industry,
   flexible and wearable devices, soft sensors, actuators, and robotics,
   jewelry and art decorations, land transportation, underwater devices,
   and porous structures.},

Abstract = {The mechanical properties of 3D printed polymers parts are process
   parameter dependent. Defects such as inadvertent voids between deposited
   rasters and layers lead to weakness in produced parts, which results in
   inferior mechanical properties as compared to injection molding. An
   alternative method to change energy absorption and stiffness of a
   polymer is hybrid additive manufacturing (AM). Hybrid-AM is the use of
   additive manufacturing with one or more secondary processes that are
   fully coupled and synergistically affect part quality, functionality,
   and/or process performance. In this study, fused filament fabrication
   (FFF) was coupled with layer-kv-layer shot peening to study the dynamic
   mechanical properties of ABS 430 polymer using dynamic mechanical
   analysis (DMA). FFF is a heated extrusion process. Shot peening is a
   mechanical surface treatment that impinges a target with a
   stochastically dispersed, high velocity stream of beads. Compressive
   residual stress was imparted to preferential layer intervals during
   printing to modify the elasticity (stiffiless), viscosity, toughness,
   and glass transition temperature. Viscoelastic and dynamic mechanical
   properties are important to the performance of polymers in automotive,
   aerospace, electronics, and medical components. Coupling printing and
   peening increased the storage and loss moduli as well as the tangent
   delta. DMA results suggest that preferential layer sequences exist that
   possess higher elasticity and better absorb energy upon sinusoidal
   dynamic loading.},

Abstract = {The energy performance of buildings is a key point to achieve the
   sustainability goals of the modern world. The reduction of the heat loss
   by incorporating porosity in a monolithic material was studied. To this
   aim, lattice structures with varying lattice topology and specimen size
   were synthesised using polymer based additive manufacturing.
   Commercially available 3D printers and polymer filaments were utilised
   to manufacture such polymer lattices. Their thermal performance was
   characterised using a bespoke compact temperature-change hot chamber. A
   scaling law, based on the experimental results, has been proposed for
   the first time to predict the U-value of polymer lattices by correlating
   their effective thermal conductivities. It was observed that the
   lattice's relative density and the sizes of a unit cell and specimen
   affected significantly the U-value. Also, it was found that
   polymer-lattice structures can be designed to only allow a conductive
   mode of heat transfer when their hydraulic diameter was less than 8 mm.
   The effect of an AM process parameters such as the layer thickness and
   type of 3D printer on the U-value of the polymer lattices was also
   characterised and found that they had a mild effect on the U-value of
   the lattices. Thus, a highly optimised lattice structure, aiming at
   achieving the higher thermal resistance to make it suitable for energy
   saving applications, can be obtained using the proposed scaling law.},

Abstract = {3D-printing application in dentistry not only enables the manufacture of
   patient-specific devices and tissue constructs, but also allows mass

   dentistry, as it can produce dynamic and adaptable materials, which have
   proven effective in the oral environment, under its continuously
   changing thermal and humidity conditions. It is expected to further
   boost the research into producing a whole tooth, capable to harmoniously
   integrate with the surrounding periodontium, which represents the
   ultimate goal of tissue engineering in dentistry. Because of their high
   versatility associated with the wide variety of available materials,
   additive manufacturing in dentistry predominantly targets the production
   of polymeric constructs. The aim of this narrative review is to catch a
   glimpse of the current state-of-the-art of additive manufacturing in

Abstract = {Fabrication of arterial phantoms is enabled through specially developed
   additive manufacturing techniques in the Organic Mechatronics and Smart
   Materials Laboratory to produce high resolution 3D conjugated polymer
   structures. These techniques have been modified to enable fabrication of
   arterial phantoms through the direct ink writing of polydimethylsiloxane
   (PDMS) into a microgel support bath. This support bath behaves as a
   Bingham plastic, deforming under shear stress during extrusion but
   quickly returning to solid-state, thus supporting the PDMS and allowing
   the desired structure to be maintained, producing high-resolution
   complex geometries. Following curing and removal of the PDMS phantom
   from the support bath, PEDOT:PSS thin films are selectively deposited on
   the phantom surface. These films have demonstrated significant
   hygroscopic actuation under an applied electric field. These phantoms
   may be imaged with Particle image velocimetry (PIV) to characterize the
   effect of actively changing vessel geometry. PIV can provide the
   instantaneous full-field velocity profile and is a well-established
   technique to characterize flow through phantoms fabricated by
   conventional casting techniques to provide a standard of comparison. To
   effectively image the device via PIV, the optical properties of the
   components must be considered. To this end, PDMS and PEDOT:PSS have been
   employed due to their favourable transmission properties in the visible
   spectrum. Additionally, PDMS provides a compliant passive structure to
   be deformed with relatively low force, easing the performance
   requirements of the actuators. While this device focuses on the
   actuation of phantom vessel geometry, this technique may be extended to
   other applications in microfluidics to create onboard peristaltic
   pumping action and vascular networks.},

Abstract = {In the present work, a comprehensive study is undertaken to analyze the
   mechanical strength and failure of different polymers reinforced with
   adaptable fibers. For the purpose of analyzing tensile strength,
   specimens as per ASTM standards with different permutations and
   combinations of polymers with fibers were additively manufactured and
   tested. Three different sets of samples, namely ABS (acrylonitrile
   butadiene styrene), PLA (polylactic acid) and onyx in combination with
   other synthetic fibers such as carbon and Kevlar, were used. These
   materials, i.e., ABS, PLA and onyx in combination with carbon fiber,
   have generated a healthy response to tensile loading and exhibited much
   higher peak load with larger plastic phase. Also, these additive
   manufactured fiber-reinforced thermoplastics' failure was analyzed using
   von Mises criterion and is found to be within the recommended limit.
   These reinforced thermoplastics can be used for manufacturing of tiny,
   intricate and complex parts for medical applications.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the joining of metal to polymer by material
   extrusion additive manufacturing. Direct joining by layered extrusion
   was used to fabricate hybrid single lap joints of acrylonitrile
   butadiene styrene (ABS) and aluminum alloy 5052. The influence of the
   printing speed, bed temperature, and nozzle Z-offset on the lap shear
   strength was studied experimentally. The interface between the two
   materials was also observed under scanning electron microscope, and the
   chemical state of the polymer after printing was analyzed using
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results revealed that elevated bed
   temperature and pressure application through lowering the Z-offset
   promoted better polymer filling of the metal surface structure and
   improved the joint strength by mechanical interlocking. Also, long
   exposure time to the heated build plate corresponding to low printing
   speeds lowered the mechanical performance of the polymer bulk due to
   thermal degradation. Mechanical interlocking was the main joining
   mechanism, but under high bed temperatures where the carbonyl group had
   formed due to degradation, a (C-O-Al) chemical bond was detected.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has become a widely applied process to print
   polymer and metallic parts in small scale. In recent years, AM processes
   and instruments are developed to print structure with two or multiple
   materials to form alloy during printing. The material composition in the
   printing process became a critical issue in determining the quality of
   the printed part. This paper presents a new approach to detect the metal
   material composition in the printed structure through thermal imaging.
   This approach tests the temperature variation and cooling rate of the
   melt metal during it is cooling down to solid. Through a theoretical
   model, it is proved that the cooling rate is a function of the material
   thermal properties, which can be made use of for retrieving the material
   composition. For copper-Inconel 625 alloy, an alloy widely studied in
   metal additive manufacturing technology, the theoretical model shows
   that the cooling rate monotonically increases with the increase of
   copper's weight percentage at constant temperature. Such a relationship
   is also experimentally tested by using a high-speed camera observing the
   process of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). The experimental results
   validate the relationship given by the theoretical model. It shows that
   the developed technique is able to serve as a new methodology to measure
   the alloy composition in real-time, for improving the consistency of
   mechanical/thermal properties of the printed parts. (C) 2022 Society of

Abstract = {This paper describes an additive manufacturing technology that has the
   potential to print plastic components with integral conductive polymer
   electronic circuits. This could have a major impact in the fields of
   robotics and mechatronics as it has the potential to allow large wiring
   looms, often an issue with complex robotic systems, to be printed as an
   integral part of the products plastic shell. This paper describes the
   development of a novel Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process in which
   the layers of material that make up the part are deposited as curved
   layers instead of the conventional flat layers. This opens up
   possibilities of building curved plastic parts that have conductive
   electronic tracks and components printed as an integral part of the
   plastic component, thereby eliminating printed circuit boards and
   wiring. It is not possible to do this with existing flat-layer additive
   manufacturing technologies as the continuity of a circuit could be
   interrupted between the layers. With curved-layer fused deposition
   modeling (CLFDM) this problem is removed as continuous filaments in 3
   dimensions can be produced, allowing for continuous conductive circuits.},

Abstract = {Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is a widely embraced material extrusion
   (MEX) additive manufacturing (AM) process to produce complex
   three-dimensional structures, and it is typically used in the
   fabrication of biodegradable polymers for biomedical applications.
   However, FFF as a fabrication process for blended polymeric materials
   needs to be optimized for enhanced mechanical properties. In this work,
   biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA)/polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) dog-bone
   and notched specimens are printed to determine optimum printing
   parameters for superior mechanical properties in FFF additive
   manufacturing. The effect of layer thickness, infill density, and
   printing bed temperature on mechanical properties is investigated by
   employing a design of experiments (DoE) approach using response surface
   methodology (RSM). Experimental results showed the significance of the
   opted parameters for mechanical properties of the PLA/PHA blend. Then,
   optimum values for layer thickness, infill density, and printing bed
   temperature are identified for tensile and impact strength and an
   empirical relationship between parameters is formulated for low density
   and cost-effective fabrication. Finally, the analysis of variance
   (ANOVA) is performed to check the adequacy of the model for the
   influence of process parameters and their mutual interactions. The
   verification experiments validated the adequacy of the proposed model
   for PLA/PHA blend in FFF additive manufacturing.},

Abstract = {Melt emulsification is a top-down approach that so far has been applied
   in the food industries (cf. homogenization of milk) and in
   pharmaceutical applications. Within this contribution the applicability
   of the process for the production of spherical polymer microparticles
   will be outlined. Size reduction of the polymer raw melt emulsion was
   realized in a rotor-stator-device. The process is characterized for
   paraffin and polyethylene (PE) waxes in aqueous environment using Tween
   85 as an emulsifier. Process temperature and dispersed phase viscosity
   have the largest impact on the particle size distribution (PSD):
   decreasing temperature and viscosity leads to smaller particles. The
   suitability of the melt emulsification process for technical polymers is
   demonstrated for polypropylene (PP) emulsified in a continuous
   hexadecane phase. Polymer particles obtained by the proposed method are
   promising candidates for advanced powders for additive manufacturing
   processes like selective laser beam melting (LBM) of polymers. The LBM
   processability of the obtained PP powders is demonstrated by production
   of sintered layers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM, 3D Printing) of hierarchical polymer
   structures for a targeted function represents a grand challenge in the
   field of polymer science and engineering. Because advanced functional
   materials often do not possess suitable mechanical and rheological
   properties for conventional fused deposition modeling, a key challenge
   that researchers face is in integrating custom deposition tool heads
   that enable printing of non-filamentary materials while preserving
   synchrony with the motion axes. In this article, we demonstrate a highly
   versatile hardware and software platform for melt and solution-phase
   benchtop AM and highlight patterning and post-deposition processing of a
   series of non-filament forming functional polymers, including PS-b-PLA
   bottlebrush block copolymers, semiconducting polymer DPP2T-TT,
   conducting polymer PEDOT:PSS
   {[}poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate)], and an
   SiO2-PE nanoporous polymer matrix composite. We present a free and
   open-source Python module, PolyChemPrint, which serves as a
   research-optimized AM control software. The cross-platform
   (Windows/Linux) software is designed to be extremely flexible in terms
   the hardware that can be connected and a detailed user manual and
   developer guide are provided for use by researchers without extensive
   computer programming experience. Finally, we provide extensive details
   of the hardware used for operation of low- and high-pressure pneumatic
   extruders and a laser module as rapidly interchangeable tool heads.},

Abstract = {Selective laser sintering (SLS) is an additive manufacturing process
   that yields excellent part qualities. This process employs micron-sized
   polymer particles, which are selectively fused by a laser. While there
   seem to be hardly any boundaries regarding design, there are quite some
   restrictions concerning the variety of commercially available SLS
   materials. At the moment, the most widely used polymeric material for
   SLS is polyamide 12 (PA12), with a market share of roughly 95\%. In
   order to broaden the field of application of SLS, novel polymer powders
   with good handling properties are needed. In this contribution,
   different liquid phase processes enabling the manufacturing of spherical
   micron-sized polymer particles are outlined.},

Title = {Laser beam heat treatment in large-scale additive manufacturing},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 4},
Abstract = {Large-scale additive manufacturing (LSAM) has been developing a huge
   potential to address certain tasks in industrial applications over the
   last years. Particularly granule extrusion technologies enable the
   processing of an enormous variety of materials but also introduce new
   challenges in printing large-scale parts. Compared to fused layer
   modelling and due to larger nozzle diameters as well as higher extrusion
   rates strand geometry and consequently, process-related voids are
   enlarged. A promising approach to improve part quality is the
   integration of carbon dioxide laser (CO2) radiation into the additive
   manufacturing process to weld deposited strands by increasing the
   interface temperature. Experiments are conducted for polymethyl
   methacrylate (PMMA) and styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN) which are very good
   absorbers of the wavelength 10.6 mu m. Due to the locally defined heat
   treatment, merely certain areas of the strands are heated to a desired
   temperature. This leads to a more complete diffusion. At the same time,
   temperature gradients in the overall part are avoided. By means of a
   thermographic camera, the temperatures at the re-melting process of
   deposited strands can be precisely monitored. Therefore, the relation
   between laser intensity and resulting temperature can be transferred
   into a repeatable process window. The interaction between laser and
   deposited material leads to a wider contact area between stacked
   strands. While flexural strength is not significantly affected, compared
   to specimens manufactured without any heat treatment bending force is
   increased by 66\% (PMMA) and 48\% (SAN), respectively. In addition,
   voids between adjacent strands are reduced by up to 57\%.},

Abstract = {Rapid tooling is a methodology which aims to integrate additive
   manufacturing into the production of tools to be used in casting,
   forming or machining processes. In forming, rapid tooling is applied in
   the production of metallic or plastic tools that guarantee good
   performance in small- and medium-sized batch production. However, most
   punches tested to date have dimensions measured in millimeters and are
   therefore unsuitable for typical real-world industrial processes. In
   this study, the performance of plastic punches with geometries designed
   for industrial application was investigated. A deep drawing process
   involving AISI 304 blanks was created for the manufacturing of cups.
   Experimental and numerical analyses were conducted to measure the
   quality of the cups produced and the behaviour of the punches involved.
   The results indicate that when punch dimensions increase, a more precise
   cup geometry is produced (99\% of drawing depth, 98\% of cup precision
   on the fillet radius, and roundness error equal to 0.53\%).},

Abstract = {Natural fibres derived from plants, animals, and minerals have been used
   by humans since the start of civilization. Since then, with the changing
   human needs, these naturally occurring fibres are finding new
   applications and uses. Due to their high specific strength, low density,
   and biocompatibility, these natural fibres have found use as filler
   materials in advanced composite materials in the 21st century. In an
   environment concerned and the energy-hungry world, another notable
   stride towards sustainable engineering is the use of additive
   manufacturing. Due to its low energy consumption, minimal material
   wastage, and easy fabricability of complicated parts, additive
   manufacturing has gained attention as the norm of the future. Hence,
   there has been increasing popularity to try and manufacture composite
   reinforced with natural fibres through the additive manufacturing route.
   In this paper, we have tried to summarize the recent developments in the
   field of additive manufacturing of Natural fibre reinforced composites.
   Comprehensive discussions regarding the different kinds of natural
   fibres, additive manufacturing routes, pre-processing of natural fibres
   and their biodegradability have been included. In the end, we have drawn
   some conclusions and have suggested future directions to the research.

Abstract = {High-performance thermoplastic polymers, such as Poly(aryl ether
   ketone)s (PAEK)s, can be used in various space applications due to their
   high mechanical properties, low density, and low outgassing properties.
   Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) is a thermoplastic semi-crystalline
   polymer belonging to the PAEKs family, which, together with its
   composites, has been proved to be processable via Additive
   Manufacturing, in particular via Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF),
   enabling the production of parts both on-ground and possibly even for
   out-of-earth. In the past years, extensive efforts have been spent on
   the improvement of 3D-printed polymeric structures, extending the
   applications of high-performance polymers from purely mechanical to
   functional ones. It is possible to confer new properties to polymers by
   mixing and blending tailored fillers and different additives (e.g.,
   clays, NdFeB powders, magnetite, and carbon fillers). Composite and
   nanocomposite polymers present customized functional properties such as
   electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, soft and hard magnetic
   properties absent or utterly different from the ones of pure polymer. In
   this paper, we report the state of the art on 3D-printed PEEK
   composites, their mechanical properties, and functionalities in view of
   the production of parts made of PEEK composites and nanocomposites, and
   their possible space applications (e.g., electromagnetic devices,
   magnetic shielding, thermal protection system and sensors).},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a common name for a group of techniques
   that are applied for constructing three-dimensional (3D) objects in a
   layer-by-layer process. One of the AM methods is multi-jet printing,
   which offers high accuracy of printed polymeric elements and the
   possibility of manufacturing products with complex shapes. Elements
   manufactured using AM are exploited in many industrial branches, e.g.
   energetic, medicine or aerospace. It results in development of
   structural health monitoring (SHM) systems. Among a variety of sensors
   applied for SHM systems fibre Bragg grating sensors (FBG) are a very
   promising solution. Their advantages, such as small size, multiplexing
   capabilities and no calibration requirements, allow them to be embedded
   into different material types.
   The goal of the paper is to analyze possibility of FBG sensors embedding
   into an AM polymeric material. The analyzes will be related to the
   influence of the manufacturing process on FBG sensors as well as
   influence of temperature on the sensors after finished embedding
   process.},

Abstract = {The additive manufacturing (AM) technology can manufacture complex parts
   with considerable improvements in lead times and lower material
   wastages. It has enabled technological advances across many domains,
   from space to medical devices. The polymer composites fabricated through
   AM have tremendous advantages over conventional polymers in terms of
   mechanical performance and are, therefore, better suited for producing
   functional parts and assemblies. However, AM of polymer composites still
   presents several technological obstacles that prevent their full
   commercial utilization. These challenges include limited combinations of
   matrix and reinforcements, a requirement for hardware modification of
   existing machines, and challenges in mechanical characterization. This
   article attempts to comprehensively review the fundamentals and features
   of contemporary additively manufactured polymer composites (AMPCs) and
   examines current cutting-edge research and development. This review
   highlights the gaps in the mechanical characterization of polymer
   composites fabricated through various technologies like material
   extrusion, vat-photopolymerization, binder jetting, material jetting,
   powder bed fusion, and sheet lamination. There is a need to fill the
   identified research gaps to make AMPCs more appealing for widespread
   industrial use for advanced applications.},

Title = {An additively manufactured silicone polymer: Thermo-viscoelastic
   experimental study and computational modelling},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The additive manufacturing (AM) is a new paradigm across various
   disciplines of engineering sciences. Despite significant advances in the
   areas of hard material printings, the options for 3D printed soft
   materials are still limited. Most of the existing 3D printed polymers
   are in the areas of acrylics and polyurethanes or their composites.
   Recently emerged Digital Light Synthesis (DLS) technology hugely
   accelerates the additive manufacturing of soft polymers. A DLS-inspired
   3D printer uses a continuous building technique instead of a
   layer-bylayer approach, where the curing process is activated by an
   ultra-violet (UV) light. In this contribution, a DLS-based digitally
   printed silicone (SIL30) is experimentally characterized. To understand
   polymer's temperature-dependent mechanical responses, an extensive
   thermo-viscoelastic experimental characterisation at various strain
   rates under tensile deformation and temperature fields from -20 degrees
   C to 60 degrees C is performed. The study reveals significant effects of
   time-and temperature-dependency on the mechanical responses of the 3D
   printed silicone. Motivated by the thermo-mechanical results of the
   polymer, a thermodynamically consistent constitutive model at large
   strain is devised. Afterwards, the model is calibrated to the data that
   results in the identification of relevant parameters. The model predicts
   the experimental results with a good accuracy. 3D printed soft polymers
   are major candidates in designing complex and intricate architectured
   metamaterials for biomedical applications. Hence, a comprehensive
   thermo-mechanical experimental study and subsequent constitutive
   modelling will facilitate in designing and simulating more complex
   cellular metamaterials using 3D printed silicones.},

Abstract = {The use of the Texas Instruments DLP (R) LightCrafter (TM) as a compact
   module in lithography-based additive manufacturing technologies (AMT) is
   discussed in this paper. For this purpose the light engine is placed
   underneath a transparent vat which is coated with a PTFE-film and filled
   with photosensitive resin. By loading an appropriate bitmap into the
   light engine, the resin can be exposed selectively to obtain a
   photopolymerized layer. To integrate the device into the building
   process, a configurable I/O trigger is required since the loaded bitmap
   should be exposed only in a certain period (exposure time). By stacking
   up the individual layers with a typical layer thickness between 25 and
   50 mu m, a three-dimensional part is built up. The current setup of the
   used digital LEDs in combination with a customized optical projection
   system ensures a spatial and temporal homogeneity of the intensity at
   the build platform, which is significantly better than with
   traditionally used engines. It could be shown that this system can
   fabricate three-dimensional parts with a resolution < 40 mu m in x-y
   plane and 15 mu m in z-axis. Additionally, mechanical properties (e. g.
   bending strength) were measured and potential anisotropies, which might
   be caused by the layered manufacturing process, were assessed.
   Ceramic-filled polymers were also used and the necessary post-processing
   steps like the removal of the polymer phase after structuring and the
   final sintering step to obtain fully dense ceramic parts are discussed.},

Journal = {POLYMER INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {8, SI},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Fusion bonding theory is applied to the additive manufacturing process
   to predict the strength developed across the interface between the
   deposited layers in material extrusion based large-scale additive
   manufacturing. Relaxation times were determined through rheology
   investigations of the neat polymers and were extrapolated across the
   entire process temperature range to estimate the required welding times
   for optimal bond formation. For the calculation of bond formation during
   cooling from the melt, the semicrystalline polyaryletherketone is
   considered amorphous until the onset of crystallization which is
   determined by recreating the process thermal history in DSC
   measurements. A significant improvement in bond development during
   additive manufacturing is achieved through the use of specifically
   designed polymers with slower crystallization kinetics. Both in
   small-scale additive manufacturing, achieving full bonding, and in
   large-scale additive manufacturing, they achieve significantly higher
   interlaminar strength than the reference material, validated by
   three-point bending. A very good match between the estimated degree of
   bonding and the tested strength of upright printed specimens in
   three-point bending was found. While the fusion bonding model calculates
   a degree of bonding of 42.07\%, mechanical testing showed 42.54\% of the
   bulk flexural strength. The study outlines a procedure to evaluate
   materials for additive manufacturing by material extrusion based on
   small material samples to shorten and improve the process development.

Journal = {POLYMER TESTING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {90},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Laminated polymer-steel composites are promising layered materials for
   practical applications in the automotive industry considering their
   superior crush resistance capacity in terms of enhanced damping
   potential. In this research, the sheet lamination (SL) route of friction
   stir additive manufacturing (FTAM) technology was implemented for the
   production of a poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA) polymer matrix composite
   structure as reinforced by textile stainless steel layers, and feeding
   of PMMA granulates inside the stirred region. Layers bonding and the
   soundness of composite formation during fabrication of the laminated
   structure were studied. Possible chemical interactions between the steel
   and PMMA during friction stir mixing followed by solid-state
   consolidation of composite layers were characterized by X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The results revealed some
   evidence for dipole bonding between iron with oxygen and carbon
   elements. Orientation dependency of polymer-steel sheet laminated
   composite structures was demonstrated by universal tensile testing and
   flexural bending from different sections and fractographic analyses.
   Superior flexural bending (around 90\% of PMMA) was shown for the
   produced layered structure.},

Abstract = {Powder metallurgy (P/M) is known as an industrial part manufacturing by
   powder pressing and sintering using ceramic and metal based particulars,
   but, P/M method has incorperated the additive manufacturing as a new
   method which is combined in technologies of laser, machine, design and
   software. The manufacturing of prototype and/or useful industrial parts
   has become possible as layer upon layer with today's additive
   manufacturing technology by using suitable laser, electron and
   ultraviolet beam in form of powder, wire, sheet and melt from polymer,
   ceramic and metal based materials. The literature survey has been done
   about the powder bed/feed additive manufacturing methods, the powder
   characterizations used in these methods and powder manufacturing methods
   in this study. In addition, the effect of dimension, shape, physical
   properties, and chemical purity of powders on the product properties
   manufactured by powder bed/feed additive manufacturing can be expressed
   with respect of investigations in the literature.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is the fabrication of real three-dimensional
   objects from metals, ceramics, or plastics by adding material, usually
   as layers. There are several variants of AM; among them material
   extrusion (ME) is one of the most versatile and widely used. In MEAM,
   molten or viscous materials are pushed through an orifice and are
   selectively deposited as strands to form stacked layers and subsequently
   a three-dimensional object. The commonly used materials for MEAM are
   thermoplastic polymers and particulate composites; however, recently
   innovative formulations of highly-filled polymers (HP) with metals or
   ceramics have also been made available. MEAM with HP is an indirect
   process, which uses sacrificial polymeric binders to shape metallic and
   ceramic components. After removing the binder, the powder particles are
   fused together in a conventional sintering step. In this review the
   different types of MEAM techniques and relevant industrial approaches
   for the fabrication of metallic and ceramic components are described.
   The composition of certain HP binder systems and powders are presented;
   the methods of compounding and filament making HP are explained; the
   stages of shaping, debinding, and sintering are discussed; and finally a
   comparison of the parts produced via MEAM-HP with those produced via
   other manufacturing techniques is presented.},

Title = {Application of Spectroscopy in Additive Manufacturing},
Journal = {MATERIALS},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a rapidly expanding material production
   technique that brings new opportunities in various fields as it enables
   fast and low-cost prototyping as well as easy customisation. However, it
   is still hindered by raw material selection, processing defects and
   final product assessment/adjustment in pre-, in- and post-processing
   stages. Spectroscopic techniques offer suitable inspection, diagnosis
   and product trouble-shooting at each stage of AM processing. This review
   outlines the limitations in AM processes and the prospective role of
   spectroscopy in addressing these challenges. An overview on the
   principles and applications of AM techniques is presented, followed by
   the principles of spectroscopic techniques involved in AM and their
   applications in assessing additively manufactured parts.},

Title = {Additive manufacturing of anisotropic graphene-based composites for
   thermal management applications},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {70},
Month = {MAY 25},
Abstract = {The use of additive manufacturing (AM) for the rapid, facile creation of
   complex structures could provide thermal management solutions in the
   form of heat sinks and heat exchangers with high surface areas that
   facilitate heat dissipation. To prepare a heat sink with high thermal
   conductivity (TC), we use vat photopolymerization (VPP) of a
   polymer-based composite material with a low TC that is enhanced by
   loading with a graphene-based thermally conductive filler. Phase
   separation of the carbon-based filler, in this case graphene
   nanoplatelets (GNP), in the monomer printing solution is prevented by
   stabilizing the GNPs by the addition of a second fiber-like clay
   (sepiolite) filler, which traps the GNPs. This methodology enables the
   AM of a composite with a relatively high GNP concentration of 2.0 wt \%,
   yielding a TC increase of 160 \% vs. the pristine polymer-an impressive
   accomplishment for VPP 3D printing. Moreover, this printing technique
   yields a material with anisotropic TC with a cross-plane/in-plane
   (TC/TC=) ratio of 1.6, which is beneficial for thermal management
   systems required to dissipate the heat vertically from a heat source.
   Such VPP 3D-printed composites with high and anisotropic TC could be
   applied in thermal management systems made of lightweight and
   costeffective materials.},

Abstract = {Ceramic samples were fabricated from alumina using traditional and
   additive technologies. Slipcasting technique was used to prepare sample
   as a traditional way, from pink alumina ceramic slurry with further
   drying a high temperature treatment of dried preformed ceramics. For
   preparation of second sample by additive route, stereolythography or SLA
   3D-printing was used. This sample firstly formed a so called green body
   ceramic from photopolymerazed slurry, that forms an organo-inorganic
   composite with alumina as a filler. Preformed green body ceramic then
   undergoes a several stages of heat treatment: first is debinding
   process, at low temperature to rid of polymer binder and second stage is
   annealing at higher temperatures to fuse alumina particles together and
   get desired strength and porosity level. Samples were studied using GE
   Vtomex c 450 X-ray tomography device. It allowed to compare accuracy of
   geometry, surface roughness and porosity of samples. It is shown that
   additive technology due to high accuracy of fabrication is a perspective
   way of precision fabrication of ceramic parts with high quality. (C)

Title = {A Fully Coupled Simulation of Planar Deposition Flow and Fiber
   Orientation in Polymer Composites Additive Manufacturing},
Journal = {MATERIALS},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Numerical studies for polymer composites deposition additive
   manufacturing have provided significant insight promoting the rapid
   development of the technology. However, little of existing literature
   addresses the complex yet important polymer composite melt flow-fiber
   orientation coupling during deposition. This paper explores the effect
   of flow-fiber interaction for polymer deposition of 13 wt.\% Carbon
   Fiber filled Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (CF/ABS) composites through
   a finite-element-based numerical approach. The molten composite flow in
   the extrusion die plus a strand of the deposited bead contacting the
   deposition substrate is modelled using a 2D isothermal and
   incompressible Newtonian planar flow model, where the material
   deposition rate is similar to 110 mm/s simulating a large scale additive
   manufacturing process. The Folgar-Tucker model associated with the
   Advani-Tucker orientation tensor approach is adopted for the evaluation
   of the fiber orientation state, where the orthotropic fitted closure is
   applied. By comparing the computed results between the uncoupled and
   fully coupled solutions, it is found that the flow-orientation effects
   are mostly seen in the nozzle convergence zone and the
   extrusion-deposition transition zone of the flow domain. Further, the
   fully coupled fiber orientation solution is highly sensitive to the
   choice of the fiber-fiber interaction coefficient CI, e.g., assigning CI
   as 0.01 and 0.001 results in a 23\% partial relative difference in the
   predicted elastic modulus along deposition direction. In addition,
   Structural properties of deposited CF/ABS beads based on our predicted
   fiber orientation results show favorable agreements with related
   experimental studies.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing is distinguished from traditional manufacturing
   techniques such as casting and machining by its ability to handle
   complex shapes with great design flexibility and without the typical
   waste. Although this technique has been mainly used for rapid
   prototyping, interest is growing in direct manufacture of actual parts.
   For wide spread application of 3D additive manufacturing, both
   techniques and feedstock materials require improvements to meet the
   mechanical requirements of load-bearing components. Here, we
   investigated short fiber (0.2-0.4 mm) reinforced
   acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene composites as a feedstock for
   3D-printing in terms of their processibility, microstructure and
   mechanical performance. The additive components are also compared with
   traditional compression molded composites. The tensile strength and
   modulus of 3D-printed samples increased similar to 115\% and similar to
   700\%, respectively. 3D-printing yielded samples with very high fiber
   orientation in the printing direction (up to 91.5\%), whereas,
   compression molding process yielded samples with significantly lower
   fiber orientation. Microstructure-mechanical property relationships
   revealed that although a relatively high porosity is observed in
   3D-printed composites as compared to those produced by the conventional
   compression molding technique, they both exhibited comparable tensile

Abstract = {Background: Among additive manufacturing techniques, the filament-based
   technique involves what is referred to as fused deposition modeling
   (FDM). FDM materials are currently limited to a selected number of
   polymers. The present study focused on investigating the potential of
   using high-end engineering polymers in FDM. In addition, a critical
   review of the materials available on the market compared with those
   studied here was completed.
   Methods: Different engineering thermoplastics, ranging from industrial
   grade polycarbonates to novel polyetheretherketones (PEEKs), were
   processed by FDM. Prior to this, for innovative filaments based on PEEK,
   extrusion processing was carried out. Mechanical properties (i.e.,
   tensile and flexural) were investigated for each extruded material. An
   industrial-type FDM machine (Stratasys Fortus((R)) 400 mc) was used to
   fully characterize the effect of printing parameters on the mechanical
   properties of polycarbonate. The obtained properties were compared with
   samples obtained by injection molding. Finally, FDM samples made of PEEK
   were also characterized and compared with those obtained by injection
   molding.
   Results: The effect of raster to raster air gap and raster angle on
   tensile and flexural properties of printed PC was evidenced; the
   potential of PEEK filaments, as novel FDM material, was highlighted in
   comparison to state of the art materials.
   Conclusions: Comparison with injection molded parts allowed to better
   understand FDM potential for functional applications. The study
   discussed pros and cons of the different materials. Finally, the
   development of novel PEEK filaments achieved important results offering
   a novel solution to the market when high mechanical and thermal
   properties are required.},

Journal = {MATERIALS LETTERS},

Abstract = {Flexible electronics refers to the technology that assembles electronic
   materials on a flexible substrate. However, rigid traces and
   uncontrollable electrical resistance under bending conditions remain
   critical problems in the application of flexible electronics. Herein, we
   investigated a four-axis additive manufacturing method for creating
   non-planar flexible electronics utilizing polyethylene terephthalate
   glycol (PETG) as substrate and a polymer-copper conductive composite as
   the trace. The as-printed specimens exhibited high dimensional accuracy
   and matchable surface roughness compared with the printed planar ones.
   The interfacial bonding was revealed by the scanning electron microscope
   (SEM) and peeling test, and the interfacial gaps were observed due to
   the surface roughness. Besides, the resistance of the non planar
   electronics varied with the bending of the specimens during the
   compression test. The as-built non-planar specimens showed significantly
   lower resistance than the planar ones tested in a conformably bent
   condition.

Abstract = {Three preceramic polymer formulations for potential use in additive
   manufacturing technologies were investigated. The polymeric precursors
   include an allyl hydrido polycarbosilane (SMP-10), a mixture of SMP-10
   with a reactive ester (1,6-hexanediol diacrylate, HDDA), and a
   polydimethylsiloxane (4690A/B). The SMP-10/HDDA proved to have
   outstanding photo-curing properties, high-resolution printing, and the
   ability to easily transform into the silicon carbide phase. The same
   polymeric mixture showed the lowest viscosity value which is preferred
   in vat additive manufacturing. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that,
   after pyrolysis to 1350 degrees C, the polydimethylsiloxane polymer
   showed the highest onset decomposition temperature and the lowest
   retained weight (52 wt\%) while the allyl hydrido polycarbosilane showed
   the lowest onset decomposition temperature and highest retained weight
   (71.7 wt\%). In terms of crystallography, X-ray diffraction and
   microstructural results showed that the ceramic matrix composites
   contained both silicon carbide and silicon oxycarbide. Overall, the
   results are very promising for the fabrication of ceramic materials
   using additive manufacturing technologies.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), and more specifically 3D printing, has
   started a revolution in the manufacturing industry by providing
   production capabilities for parts that were impossible to produce a few
   years ago. A recent technology, developed by Markforged, has raised
   these capabilities to a new level by allowing the printing of polymer
   matrix composites with continuous fiber reinforcement. However, as this
   is a new manufacturing method, there is no consolidated model to predict
   the mechanical characteristics or failure modes they present when
   subjected to loads. The present work gathers the studies on the damage

Abstract = {Due to the growing number of applications for Additive Manufacturing
   (AM), an increasing need for enhanced quality control methods exists.
   Here optical measurement techniques are often used for in-situ
   monitoring in AM. There is a great potential to standardize and improve
   applications of optical measurement devices in accordance to the
   increasing requirements of measuring tasks. Beside the optical material
   qualifications, especially process-oriented changes in optical effects
   are of great relevance for in-situ evaluations. The optical
   modifications may be attributed to aggregate specific phase transitions
   coming along with variable emitted wavelengths. A measuring setup with
   two integrations spheres and a heated process chamber have been
   developed to analyze the optical interactions of laser radiation and
   visual illumination with the powder. The process oriented analysis for
   selective laser sintering lead to improved operating conditions in the
   field of in-situ measurements in combination with an accurate evaluation
   of the absorption ratio of the examined powder.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing is accelerating in hypersonic speed, which
   touched upon almost all the nook and corners of the manufacturing
   sector. The present stage wherein a 3D printer is capable of printing
   queer hybrid materials was not imagined through conventional
   manufacturing albeit it is meager existence in a few instances. Its
   expendable arms stretch to the maximum level that is even clearly
   addressed in Industry 4.0 too, by making at least a printer in a company
   for printing specific customized materials. The dream of printing
   composite material was been a long-term goal for researchers worldwide.
   This article primarily focuses on this niche area of printing natural
   fiber composite materials that too specifically jute fiber-reinforced
   composites. Very few pieces of literature are available on additive
   manufacturing of specific natural fibers. As the technique for printing
   natural fiber-reinforced composites is still under evolution, this study
   will be more interesting as it consolidates the facts and figures
   involved in 3D of jute fiber reinforced composites alone. Different
   forms of jute fibers used by the researchers include weaved jute, jute
   as continuous fiber, filament along with jute, jute fiber as
   reinforcement, jute used as rope as well as jute fiber as cement matrix
   and all these forms have been addressed in this review.},

Title = {An explorative study on respiratory health among operators working in
   polymer additive manufacturing},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {APR 17},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), or 3D printing, is a growing industry
   involving a wide range of different techniques and materials. The
   potential toxicological effects of emissions produced in the process,
   involving both ultrafine particles and volatile organic compounds
   (VOCs), are unclear, and there are concerns regarding possible health
   implications among AM operators.The objective of this study was to
   screen the presence of respiratory health effects among people working
   with liquid, powdered, or filament plastic materials in AM. MethodsIn
   total, 18 subjects working with different additive manufacturing
   techniques and production of filament with polymer feedstock and 20
   controls participated in the study. Study subjects filled out a
   questionnaire and underwent blood and urine sampling, spirometry,
   impulse oscillometry (IOS), exhaled NO test (FeNO), and collection of
   particles in exhaled air (PEx), and the exposure was assessed. Analysis
   of exhaled particles included lung surfactant components such as
   surfactant protein A (SP-A) and phosphatidylcholines. SP-A and albumin
   were determined using ELISA. Using reversed-phase liquid chromatography
   and targeted mass spectrometry, the relative abundance of 15 species of
   phosphatidylcholine (PC) was determined in exhaled particles. The
   results were evaluated by univariate and multivariate statistical
   analyses (principal component analysis). ResultsExposure and emission
   measurements in AM settings revealed a large variation in particle and
   VOC concentrations as well as the composition of VOCs, depending on the
   AM technique and feedstock. Levels of FeNO, IOS, and spirometry
   parameters were within clinical reference values for all AM operators.
   There was a difference in the relative abundance of saturated, notably
   dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (PC16:0\_16:0), and unsaturated lung
   surfactant lipids in exhaled particles between controls and AM
   operators. ConclusionThere were no statistically significant differences
   between AM operators and controls for the different health examinations,
   which may be due to the low number of participants. However, the
   observed difference in the PC lipid profile in exhaled particles
   indicates a possible impact of the exposure and could be used as
   possible early biomarkers of adverse effects in the airways.},

Abstract = {The bipolar plate is of critical importance to the efficient and long
   lasting operation of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEMFC) stack. With
   advances in membrane electrode assembly design, greater attention has
   been focused on the bipolar plate and the important role it plays.
   Although carbon composite plates are a likely candidate for the mass
   introduction of fuel cells, it is metallic plates made from thin strip
   materials which could deliver significant advantages in terms of part
   cost, electrical performance and size. However, there are some
   disadvantages. Firstly, interfacial stability of the metal interconnect
   is difficult to achieve. Secondly, and the issue addressed here, is the
   difficultly and cost in developing new plate designs when there are very
   significant tooling costs associated with manufacture. The use of
   selective laser melting (SLM: an additive manufacturing technique) was
   explored to produce metallic bipolar plates for PEMFC as a route to
   inexpensively test several plate designs without committing to tooling.
   Crucial to this was proving that, electrically, bipolar plates
   fabricated by SLM behave similarly to those produced by conventional
   manufacturing techniques. This research presents the development of a
   small stack to compare the short term performance of metallic plates
   made by machining against those made by SLM. Experimental results
   demonstrate that the cell performance in this case was unaffected by the
   manufacturing method used and it is therefore concluded that additive
   manufacturing could be a very useful tool to aid the rapid development
   of metallic bipolar plate designs.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a name for techniques applied for
   constructing three-dimensional (3D) objects in a layer-by-layer process.
   Such methods can be applied for a variety of materials, like ceramics,
   polymers, and metals. It results in wide applicability of AM elements in
   many industrial branches, e.g. energetic, medicine or aerospace. Fiber
   Bragg grating (FBG) sensors due to their small dimensions and high
   chemical durability can be embedded into different material types.
   The goal of the paper is to analyze an influence of FBG sensors embedded
   into an AM polymeric samples on the polymeric structure durability. The
   samples will be manufactured using multi-jet printing method. The method
   was chosen due to its high accuracy of printed polymeric elements and
   the possibility of manufacturing products with complex shapes. The
   analyzes will be related to tensile strength determination of the
   samples with embedded FBG sensors. The comparisons will be performed for
   the samples without sensors and with sensors after manufacturing and
   after temperature treatment.},

Title = {Universal Nanocarrier Ink Platform for Biomaterials Additive
   Manufacturing},
Journal = {SMALL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {15},
Number = {51},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {Ink engineering is a fundamental area of research within additive
   manufacturing (AM) that designs next-generation biomaterials tailored
   for additive processes. During the design of new inks, specific
   requirements must be considered, such as flowability, postfabrication
   stability, biointegration, and controlled release of therapeutic
   molecules. To date, many (bio)inks have been developed; however, few are
   sufficiently versatile to address a broad range of applications. In this
   work, a universal nanocarrier ink platform is presented that provides
   tailored rheology for extrusion-based AM and facilitates the formulation
   of biofunctional inks. The universal nanocarrier ink (UNI) leverages
   reversible polymer-nanoparticle interactions to form a transient
   physical network with shear-thinning and self-healing properties
   engineered for direct ink writing (DIW). The unique advantage of the
   material is that a range of functional secondary polymers can be
   combined with the UNI to enable stabilization of printed constructs via
   secondary cross-linking as well as customized biofunctionality for
   tissue engineering and drug delivery applications. Specific UNI
   formulations are used for bioprinting of living tissue constructs and
   DIW of controlled release devices. The robust and versatile nature of
   the UNI platform enables rapid formulation of a broad range of
   functional inks for AM of advanced biomaterials.},

Title = {High-cycle bending fatigue properties of additive-manufactured ABS and
   PLA polymers fabricated by fused deposition modeling 3D-printing},
Journal = {FORCES IN MECHANICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Nowadays, polymer parts made by additive manufacturing methods (AM) have
   multiple applications in various industries. Different parameters affect
   the print quality of the parts and subsequently their mechanical
   properties. In this study, the effect of the print direction in
   3D-printing on the high-cycle bending fatigue properties of polymer
   parts made by the fused deposition modeling (FDM) method has been
   investigated. The standard samples of the fatigue test were printed in
   both horizontal and vertical directions and were made of two polymers,
   PLA and ABS. The thickness of each layer was 0.15 mm and the infill
   percentage of the parts was 50\%. The rotary bending fatigue test was
   performed under conditions of fully-reversed stress-controlled loading
   at different stress levels. The results included the stress amplitude
   versus the fatigue lifetime of FDM 3D-printed PLA and ABS polymers.
   Besides, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the fracture
   surface was also depicted after fatigue testing. Results showed that PLA
   specimens had better fatigue lifetimes than ones of ABS samples.
   Moreover, the fatigue strength of 3D-printed samples in the horizontal
   direction was higher than that of 3D-printed specimens in the vertical
   direction. The print direction, the material and the stress level were
   found to be statistically significant factors from the analysis of
   variances. The SEM image demonstrated beach marks on the fracture
   surface of fibers (3D-printed filaments) in the PLA specimen, which
   proved cyclic loadings. Then, cleavage facets were the result of the
   brittle fracture.},

Abstract = {For some years now, additive manufacturing (AM) has offered an
   alternative to conventional manufacturing processes. The strengths of AM
   are primarily the rapid implementation of ideas into a usable product
   and the ability to produce geometrically complex shapes. It has also
   significantly advanced the lightweight design of products made of
   plastic. So far, the strength of printed components made of polymers is
   previously very limited.
   Recently, new AM processes have become available that allow the
   embedding of short and also long fibers in polymer matrix. Thus, the
   manufacturing of components that provide a significant increase in
   strength becomes possible. In this way, both complex geometries and
   sophisticated applications can be implemented. This paper therefore
   investigates how this new technology can be implemented in product
   development, focusing on sports equipment. An extensive literature
   research shows that lightweight design plays a decisive role in sports
   equipment. In addition, the advantages of AM in terms of individualized
   products and low quantities can be fully exploited.
   An example of this approach is the steering system for a seat sled used
   by paraplegic athletes in the Olympic discipline of Nordic paraskiing. A
   particular challenge here is the placement and alignment of the long
   carbon fibers within the polymer matrix and the verification of the
   strength by means of Finite-Element-Analysis (FEA). In addition,
   findings from bionics are used to optimize the lightweight design of the
   steering system. Using this example, it can be shown that the weight of
   the steering system can be drastically reduced compared to conventional
   manufacturing. At the same time, a number of parts can be saved through
   function integration and thus the manufacturing and assembly effort can
   be reduced significantly.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes an approach for additively manufacturing polymer
   optical waveguides. The production process includes flexographic
   printing of conditioning lines (5 mu m height) on a substrate, which are
   used as guiding barriers in the subsequent printing of the optical core.
   The core is additively printed (up to 50 mu m in height) with an aerosol
   jet printer, filling the gap between the conditioning lines. The
   conditioning lines do not only enhance the contact angle of the polymer,
   which results in a higher cross section of the waveguides, but also
   improve the straight edges of the printed waveguides.
   We show that the quality of the conditioning lines is directly
   correlated to the waviness of the waveguides. Consequently, the analyses
   of the waviness of the conditioning lines classifies the quality of the
   fabricated waveguides. However, the waviness of the waveguides can also
   be considered in optical simulations. In this paper we show how we
   derive a waveguide model with waviness by fitting a single sine function
   onto the topological data of the conditioning lines. With this model a
   variation of the waviness can easily be simulated and goals for
   fabrication can be set. With the simulations it is possible to verify
   that the measured waviness (period of 559.5 mu m and an amplitude of
   4.99 mu m) does not affect the optical quality of the waveguides.},

Title = {Large-scale 3D printers for additive manufacturing: design

Abstract = {Since the advent of 3D printing in the mid-1980s, additive manufacturing
   has grown steadily and found numerous applications across all types of
   industries. More recently, the industry has seen a spur of growth as the
   terms of the original patents expired and new companies entered the
   market. While there exist several different methods of additive
   manufacturing, polymer-based material extrusion 3D printing (also known
   as fused filament fabrication) has become one of the most widely used
   ones due to its lower cost, ease of use, and versatility. While
   development has greatly expanded the material availability and improved
   the quality of prints, material extrusion 3D printers have often faced a
   challenge in physical scaling. There are inherent design hurdles to the
   extrusion process when the print starts to grow larger. This paper aims
   to study the market landscape of extrusion-based 3D printing technology
   for polymer-based material as well as challenges faced in upscaling this
   technology for industrial applications. A prototype large-scale material
   extrusion 3D printer has been designed, constructed, and then tested to
   gain experimental data on large-scale 3D printing using thermoplastic
   polymers as a printing material. Results of testing and experimentation
   verified certain key design elements and how they can improve
   large-scale 3D printing. Testing also revealed how large diameter
   nozzles for the hot end introduce challenges not seen in small-scale 3D
   printers. This paper also seeks to consolidate available information
   pertaining to large-scale 3D printing into one comprehensive document.},

Title = {Investigation on using graphite filler for 3D printing of flexible
   electrically conductive polymer by extrusion-based additive
   manufacturing},
Journal = {POLYMER ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 3},
Abstract = {The rapid use of additive manufacturing (AM) in electronic industry
   identifies the need of flexible electrically conductive materials
   suitable for 3D printing. Challenges like buckling of flexible filament
   and complexity in addition of conductive fillers makes pellet-based
   extrusion the most suitable alternative for part printing. In the
   present work, graphite powder is combined with ethylene vinyl acetate
   (EVA) to print flexible electrically conductive parts. EVA graphite
   composite with filler loading up to 30\% has been investigated for its
   electrical conductivity and part printability. The composite made was
   found electrically conductive and suitable for part printing. The parts
   were printed on a CNC milling machine by using a retrofitted material
   extrusion tool with nozzle of 0.4 mm diameter and temperature range of
   130-140 degrees C. Parts were printed on a detchable heating bed placed
   on the milling machine setup. Samples of EVA with graphite filler by
   weight of 5\%, 10\%, 20\%, and 30\% were printed and were checked for
   electrical conductivity. When the filler content was increased from 10\%
   to 20\%, the electrical resistance of the composite was reduced by
   62.6\%. The presence and uniform dispersion of graphite flakes in the
   polymer matrix of EVA were guaranteed by the rheological and
   morphological characterization of the composite. Applications of 3D
   printable flexible electrically conductive parts lies in numerous
   domains including biosensors, wearable health monitoring devices,
   capacitors, field effective transistors, light emitting diodes, solar
   cells, and electronic displays.},

Title = {Design for Additive Manufacturing},
Booktitle = {POLYMER-BASED ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING: BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Pages = {23-50},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing has evolved over the past number of decades from
   a rapid prototyping technology into a viable net-shape manufacturing
   technology. Additively manufactured components are now being used for
   medical device applications all over the world, from custom splints and
   casts to implanted orthopaedic joints which improve patient experience
   quality of life. Traditional design for manufacturing and assembly
   (DFMA) guidelines have moulded the design transition from product
   concept to the final product, allowing manufacturers to produce products
   more efficiently and cost-effectively. In traditional manufacturing, as
   product complexity increases, both cost and manufacturing time also
   increases; thus, products are often simplified to improve
   manufacturability. Simplifying products, however, reduces both designer
   intent and often product performance. Additive manufacturing has many
   advantages over traditional manufacturing which will be discussed in
   this chapter, such as topology optimisation, geometrical design freedom
   and product consolidation as well as the ability to disrupt traditional
   supply chains. Additive manufacturing is not restrained by traditional
   DFMA guidelines, so as a result, design for additive manufacturing
   (DFAM) guidelines are instead used to guide product fabrication using
   this manufacturing technology. Additive manufacturing is suited to
   low-volume, complex components, and thus careful consideration should be
   given to the selection of this technology over traditional manufacturing
   technologies. Product design considerations such as build orientation
   and support structures will be presented which affect manufacturing cost
   and time, post-processing requirements as well as mechanical properties
   of the final component. Some case studies will be presented at the end
   of this chapter which use additive manufacturing to produce lighter,
   more geometrically complex or consolidated products.},

Title = {Minimise thermo-mechanical batch variations when processing medical
   grade lactide based copolymers in additive manufacturing},
Journal = {POLYMER DEGRADATION AND STABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {181},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing is suitable for producing complex geometries;
   however, variation in thermomechanical properties is observed during one
   batch cycle when degradable aliphatic polyesters are used in melt
   extrusion-based methods. This is one important reason for why additive
   manufacturing has not yet been fully utilised to produce degradable
   medical implants. Herein, the internal variation has been minimised
   during one batch cycle by assessing the effect of different processing
   parameters when using commercially available medical grade copolymers.
   To minimise the molar mass, thermal and mechanical variation within one
   batch cycle, the rheological fingerprint of the commercially available
   medical grade poly(L-lactide-co-epsilon-caprolactone) and
   poly(Llactide-co-trimethylene carbonate) has been correlated to the
   process parameters of the ARBURG Plastic Freeforming. An increase in the
   temperature up to 220 degrees C and the associated increase in pressure
   are beneficial for the viscoelastic and thermally stable
   poly(L-lactide-co-epsilon-caprolactone). In contrast, a temperature
   below 220 degrees C should be used for the
   poly(L-lactide-co-trimethylene carbonate) to reduce the variation in
   strain at break during one batch cycle. The residence time is decreased
   through the increase of the discharge parameter. An increase in
   temperature is however required to reduce the viscosity of the polymer
   and allow the pressure to stay within the machine limitations at higher
   discharge parameters.
   The results are highly relevant to the development of additive
   manufacturing for the production of degradable medical devices with
   identical properties. In fact, Food and Drug Administration guidelines
   for additive manufacturing of medical implants specify the need to
   control changes in for example material properties during the process.

Abstract = {Bioactive glass (BG) and its polymer composites have demonstrated great
   potential as scaffolds for bone defect healing. Nonetheless, processing
   these materials into complex geometry to achieve either anatomy-fitting
   designs or the desired degradation behavior remains challenging.
   Additive manufacturing (AM) enables the fabrication of BG and BG/polymer
   objects with well-defined shapes and intricate porous structures. This
   work reviewed the recent advancements made in the AM of BG and
   BG/polymer composite scaffolds intended for bone tissue engineering. A
   literature search was performed using the Scopus database to include
   publications relevant to this topic. The properties of BG based on
   different inorganic glass formers, as well as BG/polymer composites, are
   first introduced. Melt extrusion, direct ink writing, powder bed fusion,
   and vat photopolymerization are AM technologies that are compatible with
   BG or BG/polymer processing and were reviewed in terms of their recent
   advances. The value of AM in the fabrication of BG or BG/polymer
   composites lies in its ability to produce scaffolds with
   patient-specific designs and the on-demand spatial distribution of
   biomaterials, both contributing to effective bone defect healing, as
   demonstrated by in vivo studies. Based on the relationships among
   structure, physiochemical properties, and biological function,
   AM-fabricated BG or BG/polymer composite scaffolds are valuable for
   achieving safer and more efficient bone defect healing in the future.},

Abstract = {Particulate materials with well-engineered properties are of key
   importance for many aspects in our daily life. Polymer powders with high
   flowability, for example, play a crucial role in the emerging field of
   powder-based additive manufacturing processes. However, the polymer- and
   composite material selection for these technologies is still limited.
   Here, we demonstrate the design of spherical polymethyl methacrylate
   (PMMA) and PMMA-SiO2 composite supraparticle powders with excellent
   powder flowability and tailored composition for powder-based additive
   manufacturing. Our process assembles these powders from the bottom up
   and affords a precise control over surface roughness and internal
   morphology via the choice of colloidal primary particles. We establish
   process-structure-property relationships connecting external
   spray-drying parameters and primary particle sizes with the resulting
   supraparticle roughness and, subsequently, with the macroscopic powder
   flowability and powder bed density. In a second step, we demonstrate the
   control of composition and internal morphology of PMMA-SiO2 composite
   supraparticles based on different mass mixings and diameter ratios of
   the two primary particle dispersions. Finally, we successfully apply the
   prepared supraparticle powders in powder bed additive manufacturing. The
   optimized flowability of the composite powders allows the production of
   two-layered square specimens with fusion between the individual layers
   and a uniform and tunable distribution of nanoscale SiO2 additives
   without requiring the addition of any flowing aids.},

Title = {Individualized lightweight structures for biomedical applications using
   additive manufacturing and carbon fiber patched composites},
Journal = {DESIGN SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {5},
Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Combining additive manufacturing (AM) with carbon fiber reinforced
   polymer patched composites unlocks potentials in the design of
   individualized, lightweight biomedical structures. Arising design
   opportunities are geometrical individualization of structures using the
   design freedom of AM and the patient-individual design of the
   load-bearing components employing carbon fiber patch placement. To date,
   however, full exploitation of these opportunities is a complex recurring
   task, which requires a high amount of knowledge and engineering effort
   for design, optimization, and manufacturing. The goal of this study is
   to make this complexity manageable by introducing a suitable
   manufacturing strategy for individualized lightweight structures and by
   developing a digitized end-to-end design process chain, which provides a
   high degree of task automation. The approach to achieve full
   individualization uses a parametric model of the structure which is
   adapted to patients' 3D scans. Moreover, patient data is used to define
   individual load cases and perform structural optimization. The
   potentials of the approach are demonstrated on an exoskeleton hip
   structure. A significant reduction of weight compared to a standard
   design suggests that the design and manufacturing chain is promising for
   the realization of individualized high-performance structures.},

Abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies require innovative design
   paradigms and guidelines that exhaust the offered freedoms in geometry
   and material. The aim of the Design for Additive Manufacturing is to
   provide design opportunities and to enhance workpiece properties taking
   into account constraints of the process, e.g. kinematics and limitations
   of print technology. Most AM applications are constrained to three-axis
   movements limiting the fabrication of workpieceslayer by layer to one
   fixed building direction only. This causes limitations of strength
   properties, surface quality and the need of supporting structures.
   Multi-axis AM enables completely new design possibilities going beyond
   current optimization and design strategies of conventional AM
   workpieces. This innovation requires multiple design and manufacturing
   changes in the internal and external geometry of the workpiece as well
   as in machine and printing head technology. This paper identifies the
   requirements and capabilities of multi-axis AM and presents possible
   solutions to overcome the identified challenges. Preliminary results for
   multi-axis AM are described on an exemplary workpiece. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {Critical to the selection requirements for additive manufacturing (AM)
   is the need for appropriate materials. Materials requirements for AM
   include the ability to produce the feedstock in a form amenable to the
   specific AM process, suitable processing of the material by AM,
   capability to be acceptably post processed to enhance geometry and
   properties, and manifestation of necessary performance characteristics
   in service. As AM has matured, specific classes of material have become
   associated with specific AM processes and applications. This paper
   gathers this information for each of the seven categories of ISO/ASTM AM
   categories. Polymers, metals, ceramics and composites are considered.
   Microstructural features affecting AM part properties are listed.
   Service properties of AM parts are described, including physical,
   mechanical, optical and electrical properties. An additive

Abstract = {The popularity of additive manufacturing has been growing over the last
   few decades. Additive manufactured composites have a wide range of
   applications in engineering sectors specifically in aerospace
   structures. In addition to mechanical loads, they are subjected to
   thermal loads caused by aerodynamic heating. Temperature increases cause
   changes in material properties, which complicates thermal stress
   analysis. The thermal loading was simulated with specific boundary
   conditions similar to the experiments where the sample was placed inside
   the oven chamber. While for the mechanical (tensile) testing loading,
   the sample's geometry was created with gripping lines to be in
   accordance with ASTM D3039 standards for tensile tests used in
   experimental work and surface traction for the applied load. The highest
   modulus and strength were achieved from the intact sample while the
   lowest mechanical modulus and strength were obtained in the sample with
   heat treatment at prolonged temperature of 145 degrees C. At high
   temperatures, matrices soften affecting matrix-dominated properties such
   as transverse and in-plane shear stiffness and strength. A good
   correlation between the predictive models and experimental results is
   obtained.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has become more prominent in leading
   industries. Recently, there have been intense efforts to achieve a fully
   functional 3D structural electronic device by integrating conductive
   structures into AM parts. Here, we introduce a simple approach to
   creating a conductive layer on a polymer AM part by CO2 laser
   processing. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), and Raman spectroscopy were employed to analyze
   laser-induced modifications in surface morphology and surface chemistry.
   The results suggest that conductive porous graphene was obtained from
   the AM-produced carbon precursor after the CO2 laser scanning. At a
   laser power of 4.5 W, the lowest sheet resistance of 15.9 Omega/sq was
   obtained, indicating the excellent electrical conductivity of the
   laser-induced graphene (LIG). The conductive graphene on the AM parts
   could serve as an electrical interconnection and shows a potential for
   the manufacturing of electronics components. An interdigital electrode
   capacitor was written on the AM parts to demonstrate the capability of
   LIG. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and cyclability
   testing demonstrated good electrochemical performance of the LIG
   capacitor. These findings may create opportunities for the integration
   of laser direct writing electronic and additive manufacturing.},

Title = {Foam 3D Printing of Thermoplastics: A Symbiosis of Additive
   Manufacturing and Foaming Technology},
Journal = {ADVANCED SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Due to their light-weight and cost-effectiveness, cellular thermoplastic
   foams are considered as important engineering materials. On the other
   hand, additive manufacturing or 3D printing is one of the emerging and
   fastest growing manufacturing technologies due to its advantages such as
   design freedom and tool-less production. Nowadays, 3D printing of
   polymer compounds is mostly limited to manufacturing of solid parts. In
   this context, a merged foaming and printing technology can introduce a
   great alternative for the currently used foam manufacturing technologies
   such as foam injection molding. This perspective review article tackles
   the attempts taken toward initiating this novel technology to
   simultaneously foam and print thermoplastics. After explaining the
   basics of polymer foaming and additive manufacturing, this article
   classifies different attempts that have been made toward generating
   foamed printed structures while highlighting their challenges. These
   attempts are clustered into 1) architected porous structures, 2)
   syntactic foaming, 3) post-foaming of printed parts, and eventually 4)
   printing of blowing agents saturated filaments. Among these, the latest
   approach is the most practical route although it has not been thoroughly
   studied yet. A filament free approach that can be introduced as a
   potential strategy to unlock the difficulties to produce printed foam
   structures is also proposed.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) can change the way we design opto-mechanics.
   One can realize complex structures with AM that are difficult or
   impossible to achieve with conventional fabrication techniques. In a
   recent project, the US Army attempted to demonstrate athermalization of
   an infrared lens using AM design and manufacturing techniques. The goal
   was to demonstrate these new techniques in a small-scale prototype lens
   for a missile application.
   U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, Aviation and Missile
   Center teamed with Materials Sciences LLC (MSC) to apply a
   previously-reported topology-optimization technique {[}1] to develop an
   additively manufactured multi-material, opto-mechanical structure. The
   composite structure was engineered to maintain the location of the
   detector focal plane at the focus of a lens as it changes with
   temperature. MSC initially fabricated several prototype lens housings of
   additively manufactured titanium and cast urethane which failed at the
   material interfaces during temperature cycling over the intended
   operational range. MSC is currently conducting fabrication trials with
   an injection molded thermoplastic polymer to replace the cast urethane.
   These unfinished prototype feedstocks are being evaluated for structural
   integrity under temperature cycling. Initial results are promising; but
   additional fabrication trials are required to produce fully dense
   feedstocks for finish machining.
   Composite structures allow tailoring of mechanics to react as designed
   to temperature and vibration. But it is nearly impossible to model all
   aspects of a composite structure. Prototyping and testing can quickly
   reveal limitations of materials and fabrication methods that can inform
   future optimization efforts. This effort documents these iterations and
   learned lessons, and presents evidence that this AM-composite technique
   is useful for designing robust opto-mechanics and that the current
   manufacturing method can be matured to deliver operational components.},

Abstract = {Melt processing is routinely used to fabricate medical polymeric
   devices/ implants for clinical reconstruction and can be incorporated
   into quality systems procedures for medical device manufacture. As
   additive manufacturing (AM) becomes increasingly used for biomaterials
   and biofabrication, the translation of new, customizable, medical
   devices to the clinic becomes paramount. Melt processing is therefore a
   distinguishable group withinAMthat provides an avenue to manufacture
   scaffolds/implants with a clinical end-point. Three key melt
   processingAM technologies are highlighted in this review: melt
   micro-extrusion, selective laser sintering and melt electrospinning
   writing. The in vivo (including clinical) outcomes of medical devices
   and scaffolds made with these processes are reviewed. Together, they
   encompass the meltAMof scaffold architectures with feature sizes and
   resolutions ranging from 800 nmup to 700 mu m.},

Journal = {3D PRINTING AND ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Based on the established system of concrete-filled fiber-reinforced
   polymer (FRP) tube (CFFT) in civil engineering and construction
   industry, this research presents a novel fabrication method for freeform
   FRP formwork through an additive process of winding FRP fabric with
   industrial robots. Different from the filament winding or fused
   deposition modeling process in additive manufacture, large-scale
   formwork is fabricated with layered winding of FRP fabric and
   simultaneously applying fast cure epoxy resin in the proposed methods.
   It increases the fabrication speed and material efficiency compared with
   the typical fabrication process of FRP formworks, and achieved the
   geometry flexibility from the numerically controlled additive process.
   The fabrication methods are developed through a series of preliminary
   tests, exploring the appropriate fabrication parameters, such as the
   overlapping height of each layer, winding speed, and epoxy resin type.
   Two additional prototypes addressing geometrical flexibility are also
   fabricated. Based on the feasibility studies, the article discussed the
   potential application of this system on a double-skin tubular arch
   (DSTA) bridge and a tree-like topological optimized column as the future
   outlook of this method. As developed based on the established
   construction systems such as CFFTs and DSTAs, not only the proposed
   system is compatible with current structure and construction system, but
   it also benefits from combining an off-shelf material with a flexible
   and accurate programmable robotic process. This research contributes to
   the scope of additive manufacturing system by targeting the fabrication
   of nonuniform optimized large-scale structures.},

   3D printer to create customizable automotive parts that were developed
   with CAD software and produced as scaled models. To precisely compare
   the models, fabrication factors such as layer thickness, printing time
   and speed, and fill density were evaluated, and the components were
   printed at 100\% fill density. Tensile, flexural, and impact strengths
   of the filament material were found to be 46\%, 25\%, and 17\% greater
   than pure ABS composite, respectively. The study also demonstrated that
   additive manufacturing of customized car parts provided cost and

Abstract = {The paper explores the products made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
   (ABS), a common thermoplastic polymer comprising up to 10 wt.\% carbon
   fibers. These products are obtained by extrusion-based 3D printing. The
   mechanical properties of the obtained specimens are studied by tensile
   and flexural strength testing with regard to the carbon fiber content.
   The scanning electron microscopy is used to study the structure of the
   fracture surface of the tested specimens. The physical-and-mechanical
   properties of polymer specimens and products produced therefrom are
   investigated with respect to the different content of carbon fibers.
   Secondary ABS polymer subjected to natural ageing for 17000 hours is
   used to prepare the composite material. Described are the production
   techniques for the composite filament and the filament fabrication
   process, which is optimum from the viewpoint of achieving the improved
   properties of physical-and-mechanical properties of the specimens
   obtained.},

Title = {Fire resistance of additively manufactured water filled polymer parts},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {22},
Pages = {138-145},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of additively manufactured (AM) water
   filled parts (WFPs). By combining the energy absorbing properties of
   water with polymers, it is possible to significantly improve the time to
   ignition of AM parts with open internal structures. Theory relating the
   flame temperature to the maximum wall temperature of WFPs is developed.
   A range of water-polymer configurations are presented as a basis for WFP
   designs. Three separate thermal experiments were conducted to test
   different aspects of the WFPs. The time to ignition for cone calorimetry
   samples was extended 794\% over plain photopolymers. Case studies were
   used to demonstrate the effectiveness of WFPs with complex shapes. The
   results of thermo-fluid finite element simulations showed good agreement
   with experimental observations and provide a useful tool for the
   evaluation and optimisation of WFP designs. The fire resistance of thin
   walled structures with internal water volumes was found to be
   significantly improved. The water filling strategy was found to be more
   effective than adding intumescent coatings. Finally further work and
   recommendations are discussed.},

Journal = {COMPOSITES COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {39},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Material Extrusion (ME) based Continuous Fibre Reinforced Polymers
   (CFRP) is a potential solution to the poor mechanical properties of ME
   parts, but the process-induced defects from the ME process can lower the
   quality of CFRP parts. In this work, we proposed a vision based measure
   algorithm with two custom metrics to quantitatively evaluate two typical
   defects: misalignment and twist, in the ME based CFRP fabrication
   process. Based on the proposed algorithm and metrics, we explored the
   effects of four printing parameters on the defects under different path
   radii for co-extrusion based process with Taguchi method. The
   experiments illustrate Fibre Feed Rate and Printing Speed have
   significant influences on fibre misalignment, whereas these parameters
   only show minor influences on fibre twist. Additionally, it is found
   that reduced printing radius can introduce more error to the defects,
   especially for fibre twist. Based on the analysis, optimum conditions
   for infill path with different curvature radii are proposed and the
   results of confirmation experiments support the proposed adaptive search
   method for printing parameters.},

Abstract = {Commercial plastics and rubbers always contain low molecular weight
   additives. Other low molecular weight compounds are formed due to
   degradation of polymers and additives during synthesis, processing, use
   and after disposal. Knowledge of these compounds is important for
   evaluating the environmental impact and interaction of polymeric
   materials, to investigate long-term properties and degradation
   mechanisms, to verify ingredients, to investigate manufacturing
   problems, to quality control polymeric materials, to identify odorants,
   to avoid workplace exposure and to insure safety of food packaging and
   medical products. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a solvent-free
   extraction technique that has in recent years found an increasing number
   of applications in different fields. This paper presents a review of
   SPME technique in different polymer related applications including
   analysis of degradation products and polymer additives, monomer-rests,
   odor compounds, migrants from food packaging and medical products,
   extraction of polymer additives from environmental samples and
   biological fluids. Future possibilities are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Extrusion based additive manufacturing of polymer composite magnets can
   increase the solid loading volume fraction with greater mechanical force
   through the printing nozzle as compared to traditional injection molding
   process. About 63 vol\% of isotropic NdFeB magnet powders were
   compounded with 37 vol\% of polyphenylene sulfide and bonded permanent
   magnets were fabricated while using Big Area Additive Manufacturing
   without any degradation in magnetic properties. The polyphenylene
   sulfide bonded magnets have a tensile stress of 20 MPa, almost double
   than that of nylon bonded permanent magnets. Additively manufactured and
   surface-protective-resin coated bonded magnets meet the industrial
   stability criterion of up to 175 degrees C with a flux-loss of 2.35\%
   over 1000 h. They also exhibit better corrosion resistance behavior when
   exposed to acidic (pH = 1.35) solution for 24 h and also annealed at 80
   degrees C over 100 h (at 95\% relative humidity) over without coated
   magnets. Thus, polyphenylene sulfide bonded, additively manufactured,
   protective resin coated bonded permanent magnets provide better thermal,
   mechanical, and magnetic properties.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing technologies have developed rapidly in the last
   ten years and have become a technology with significant advantages
   compared to traditional manufacturing. Depending on discovering new
   materials and techniques, additive manufacturing technologies also
   develop and become more economical and sustainable technology. The
   widespread use of this technology in industrial areas has accelerated
   development and contributed to increased product quality. However, to
   ensure the development and continuity of this technology, it is
   necessary to reduce the production costs, increase the quality and
   accelerate the production processes. These processes also trigger
   competition and accelerate the development of technology. The areas that
   additive manufacturing technologies are mostly applied can be grouped as
   aerospace, biomedical, smart technologies, and other industrial
   applications. The fact that these areas are popular research areas also
   accelerates the development of additive manufacturing technologies. In
   this review, additive manufacturing technologies from past to present,
   advantages and disadvantages of these technologies, aspects that need to
   be developed, and industrial applications are examined and explained.
   When the studies on additive manufacturing technologies and industrial
   applications are examined, it is seen that this technology has a wide
   usage area. With the use of additive manufacturing technologies,
   previously encountered in prototypes and special applications, in
   automotive, biomedical, and smart technologies, it is seen that they

Title = {High modulus biocomposites via additive manufacturing: Cellulose
   nanofibril networks as ``microsponges{''}},
Journal = {COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {173},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {For the successful transition of additive manufacturing (AM) from
   prototyping to manufacturing of structural load bearing parts, feedstock
   systems with improved mechanical properties are needed. In terms of
   sustainability and environmental impact, selection of biobased renewable
   alternatives instead of petroleum-based options is important.
   Nanocellulose, which gives plants and trees their structural integrity,
   can offer significant improvements in the mechanical properties of AM
   polymers, provided that the right fibril morphology, dispersion and
   adhesion are achieved. In this study, although the interfacial adhesion
   between the hydrophilic cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and the hydrophobic
   polylactate matrix was not strong, and the optimal dispersion in
   individual fibril level was not attained, dramatic improvements in
   mechanical properties of neat polymer were achieved (up to 80\% tensile
   strength increase, up to 200\% elastic modulus increase). An
   interlocking reinforcing mechanism in which CNF bundles act as
   ``microsponges{''} was proposed and supported by high resolution
   electron microscopy images, x-ray computed chromatography scans and
   thermal and dynamic mechanical behavior. Additively manufactured samples
   showed significantly higher elastic modulus (7.12 GPa vs. 6.57 GPa at 30
   wt \% CNF content) and dramatically improved storage modulus (1.72 GPa
   vs. 0.9 GPa at 30 wt \% CNF content) in the printing direction compared
   to compression molded samples. In conclusion, preparation and
   3D-printing of a 100\% biobased renewable feedstock material with
   substantial mechanical property improvements were successfully
   demonstrated, which can open up new window of opportunities in the AM
   industry.},

Title = {Melt-Based Additive Manufacturing of Polyolefins Using Material
   Extrusion and Powder Bed Fusion},
Journal = {POLYMER REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {63},
Number = {4},
Pages = {895-960},

Abstract = {Polyolefin-based thermoplastics such as polyethylene and polypropylene
   constitute a major fraction of the polymers employed in commodity
   applications due to their ease of processability, durability, and
   economic viability. Additive manufacturing (AM) of polyolefins offers
   both a viable path toward functional prototyping of design concepts and
   direct manufacturing of end-use parts. Melt-based AM of polyolefins is
   more challenging than other semicrystalline polymers (polyamides) due to
   the relatively high levels of volumetric shrinkage encountered during
   crystallization of such polymers that lead to significant issues related
   to warpage and interlayer adhesion. The focus of this review is to
   evaluate the latest state-of-the-art for processing polyolefins by
   powder bed fusion (PBF) and material extrusion (MatEx) AM modalities.
   Recent progress in processing neat, filled, and blends of polyolefins
   using PBF and MatEx are discussed to highlight the importance of the
   rheological and morphological characteristics of the polymer melt on the
   printed parts performance. The existing challenges to AM of polyolefins
   are emphasized and strategies to address the limitations are recommended
   through a better understanding of the associated
   process-structure-property relationships. A holistic approach spanning
   synthetic modifications for feedstock development, improved system
   design, and physics-guided process parameter selection is required to
   broadly adopt melt-based AM of polyolefins.},

Abstract = {Stereolithography (SLA) is a well-established additive manufacturing
   (AM) technique that allows a resin to be photo-polymerized into high
   resolution parts with rapid production times. Vanillin, a naturally
   occurring molecule as well as a derivative easily obtained from biomass,
   including lignin, can be used as a building block for vinyl ester resins
   (VERB) and AM-ready materials. A vanillin-based VER, prepared via a
   100\% atom efficient and solventless technique, was investigated for AM
   applications due to its low viscosity and demonstrated ability to
   photopolymerize. The resin was additively manufactured via SLA and the
   effect of postprocessing after printing was investigated. The extent of
   cure between the printed and postprocessed samples was found to have the
   highest effect on polymer properties, increasing extent of cure by
   approximately 23\%. With postprocessing, the printed material was shown
   to have a glass transition temperature (T-g) of 153 degrees C and
   Young's modulus of 4900 MPa, comparable to the same resin cured via
   traditional thermal techniques. This resin system has the potential to
   be used as a standalone high strength and high T-g material for SLA.
   Furthermore, the resin system also has potential as a formulation base
   for tunable SLA cure characteristics and final desired printed polymer
   properties while retaining significant biobased content.},

Title = {Mechanical properties and fracture characterization of additive
   manufacturing polyamide 12 after accelerated weathering},
Journal = {POLYMER TESTING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {104},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The additive manufacturing (AM) methods, selective laser sintering (SLS)
   and multi jet fusion (MJF), are increasingly used for end-use polymer
   parts. Chemical reactions caused by ionizing radiation and catalyzed by
   oxygen, moisture, and heat are known to degrade the polymer structure,
   result in visual defects, and loss of mechanical properties. However,
   the effects of the AM layer-wise manufacturing process on polymer
   degradation are not widely studied. Yet, they may have implications on
   the mechanical properties and fracture mechanisms of the components.
   This paper presents an open access data repository of mechanical
   properties after weathering for AM plastics, conventionally manufactured
   plastics, and for two clear protective coatings. All materials were
   exposed to a 1500-h accelerated weathering cycle (ISO-4982-3) followed
   by tensile testing (ISO-527). Special attention was given to polyamide
   12 (PA12) produced via powder bed fusion AM in two build orientations.
   The fracture surfaces of PA12 and glass-filled PA12 were further studied
   with scanning electron microscopy. The AM materials were PA12,
   glass-filled PA12, and carbon reinforced PA12. Traditionally
   manufactured materials included glass-filled and molybdenum
   disulfide-filled PA66, PMMA, ABS, PC, and cast PA12.
   No clear differences were found between the AM build orientations in
   fracture mechanisms or weathering performance. AM and cast PA12 were
   strongly affected by accelerated weathering. Carbon reinforced PA12 with
   a UV varnish experienced the least changes. Weathering resistance was
   increased with protective coatings. However, an increase in the
   deviation of mechanical properties with the coatings was observed. The
   contrary results in ductility for the glass-filled and molybdenum
   disulfide-filled PA66 after weathering would merit further studies.},

Abstract = {The incremental deposition process utilized by most additive
   manufacturing (AM) technologies presents significant challenges related
   to residual stresses and warping which arise from repeated deposition of
   hot material onto cooler material. These issues are magnified at larger
   scale, where even a small thermal strain can correspond to several
   millimeters of deformation. In this work we investigate the thermal
   evolution in thin walls of carbon fiber/acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
   (CF/ABS) composite materials fabricated via Big Area Additive
   Manufacturing (BAAM). We measure the thermal evolution of composite
   parts during the build process using infrared imaging, and develop a
   simple 1D transient thermal model to describe the build process. The
   model predictions are in excellent agreement with the observed
   temperature profiles and from the results we develop criteria to guide
   deposition parameter selection to minimize the likelihood of cracking
   during printing. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   parts produced using material extrusion},
Journal = {RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {321-332},
Abstract = {Purpose - The weakest point in additively manufactured polymer parts
   produced by material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEAM) is the
   interface between adjacent layers and deposition toolpaths or roads.
   This study aims to predict the mechanical strength of parts by utilizing
   a novel analytical approach. Strength predictions are made using the
   temperature history of these interfaces, polymer rheological data, and
   polymer weld theory.
   Design/methodology/approach - The approach is validated using
   experimental data for two common 3D-printed polymers: polycarbonate (PC)
   and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). Interface temperature history
   data are collected in situ using infrared imaging. Rheological data of
   the polycarbonate and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene used to fabricate
   the fused filament fabrication parts in this study have been determined
   experimentally.
   Findings - The strength of the interfaces has been predicted, to within
   10\% of experimental strength, using polymer weld theory from the
   literature adapted to the specific properties of the polycarbonate and
   acrylonitrile butadiene styrene feedstock used in this study.
   Originality/value - This paper introduces a novel approach for
   predicting the strength of parts produced by MEAM based on the strength
   of interfaces using polymer weld theory, polymer rheology, temperature
   history of the interface and the forces applied to the interface. Unlike
   methods that require experimental strength data as a prediction input,
   the proposed approach is material and build orientation agnostic once
   fundamental parameters related to material composition have been
   determined.},

Abstract = {Advances in additive manufacturing have been mostly driven by
   developments in software and hardware for 3D printing. However, the
   limited number of printable polymers still restricts the applications of
   this technique. Researchers have made progress in the development of
   advanced polymeric materials that are compatible with 3D printing, by
   using a wide array of chemical interactions. In this prospective
   article, we discuss how 3D-printing technology can benefit from a
   supramolecular toolbox of dynamic covalent and non-covalent bonds.
   Furthermore, we aim to highlight how this toolbox is helping to overcome
   the main challenges in processability, functionality, and sustainability
   for 3D printing.},

Journal = {CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING \& SCIENCES},

Pages = {703-720},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), adding materials layer by layer, can be
   used to produce objects of almost any shape or geometry. However, AM
   techni- ques cannot accurately build parts with large overhangs,
   especially for the large features close to horizontal, hanging over the
   void. The overhangs will make the manufactured model deviate from the
   design model, which will result in the performance of the manufactured
   model that cannot satisfy the design require- ments. In this paper, we
   will propose a new finite element (FE) analysis model that includes the
   manufacturing errors by mimicking the AM layer by layer con- struction
   process. In such FE model, an overhang coef ficient is introduced to
   each FE, which is de fined by the support elements in the lower layer.
   By mimicking the AM process from the bottom layer to the top layer, all
   the FE properties are updated based on their overhang coef ficients,
   which makes the computational model be able to predict the manufactured
   model with manufacturing errors. The proposed model can be used to
   predict the performance of the AM objects in the design stage, which
   will help the designers to improve their design by the simulation
   results.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive numerical and experimental study on
   stress-constrained topology optimization for Fused Deposition Modeling
   (FDM) additive manufacturing. The qp method is employed to avoid the
   singularity issue of stress-constrained problems. The P-norm function
   with stability transformation is adopted to build the global stress
   constraint with iterative corrections to eliminate the gap between the
   maximum local stress and the P-norm stress. The Heaviside projection is
   employed to generate clear-cut 0-1 designs. Two benchmark examples have
   been studied with the numerical algorithm. Experiments are performed on
   the topologically optimized MBB beam to investigate the impact of the
   FDM process parameters, including deposition path direction, building
   direction, and slicing layer height, on the resulted structural
   strength. The stress-constrained designs without and with Heaviside
   projection are comparatively tested with experiments. The
   stress-minimization designs subject to different P-norm parameters are
   compared both numerically and experimentally. Experiments show that the
   deposition path direction and the building direction evidently affect
   the derived structural strength. Moreover, overthin structural members
   may severely degrade the structural strength due to manufacturing and
   loading uncertainties.},

Abstract = {Purpose The build volumes of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies
   are increasing in size. This improvement is associated with the growing
   reliability of AM processes and is driven by a rise in demand from
   several industries. Large-format additive manufacturing (LFAM), when
   referring to polymeric extrusion systems, is quite new in the field of
   AM. The purpose of this paper is to present a review of large-format
   (those with build volumes over 1 m(3)) fused deposition or
   extrusion-based AM equipment. Design/methodology/approach This paper
   presents an exhaustive literature review for all the publications in the
   field of AM in the current decade, as well as technological coverage in
   the news, specialized blogs and technology fairs since the year 2015.
   Findings This review reveals growing scientific and industrial activity,
   as well as in equipment, in the field of LFAM. An increase in research
   activity is also occurring in parallel with a growing interest,
   potential and adaptation of these technologies in certain industries.
   Originality/value This review may be the first publication to collect
   the majority of existing information on LFAM for polymeric extrusion
   systems in terms of applied extrusion technologies, commercial products,
   specific material research and developments, intellectual property,
   design and simulation solutions, as well as its practical applications.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing processes allow the production of individualized
   and complex parts without the use of molds or tools. Especially powder
   and beam-based AM processes like selective laser sintering (SLS) of
   polymers are promising, although the choice of commercial SLS powders is
   very limited. To further extend the applications of SLS, new and cheap
   materials with good processability must be supplied. Within this
   contribution two innovative methods for production of spherical polymer
   micro particles for SLS are discussed: The first approach is a process
   chain applicable to a wide range of polymers consisting of wet grinding
   in a stirred media mill followed by rounding of the obtained
   irregular-shaped particles in a heated downer reactor and subsequent dry
   coating of the spherical particles for improvement of powder
   flowability. It will be outlined for glass-filled PBT systems. The
   second approach is melt emulsification with subsequent dry coating. In
   this process a polymer melt is emulsified by elongational and shear
   stresses in a rotor stator device. The method is exemplified for
   polypropylene (PP). Both approaches allow for production of spherical
   polymer micro particles. The effect of flowability, shape and bulk
   density on the powders' processabilities in SLS is assessed.},

Journal = {MATERIALS},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper presents the static mechanical behavior and the dynamic
   thermomechanical properties of four market-available reinforced and
   non-reinforced thermoplastics and photopolymer materials used as
   precursors in different additive manufacturing technologies. This
   article proposes a characterization approach to further address
   development of aeronautic secondary structures via 3D-printed composite
   materials replacing conventional manufactured carbon fiber reinforced
   polymer (CFRP) composites. Different 3D printing materials,
   technologies, printing directions, and parameters were investigated.
   Experimental results showed that carbon-reinforced ONYX\_R material
   exhibits a transition point at 114 degrees C, a 600 MPa tensile
   strength, and an average tensile strain of 2.5\%, comparable with
   conventional CFRP composites manufactured via autoclave, making it a
   suitable candidate for replacing CFRP composites, in the aim of taking
   advantage of 3D printing technologies. ONYX material exhibits higher
   stiffness than Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene Copolymer (ABS), or
   conventional Nylon 6/6 polyamide, the flexural modulus being 2.5 GPa;
   nevertheless, the 27 degrees C determined transition temperature limits
   its stability at higher temperature. Daylight High Tensile (further
   called HTS) resin exhibits a tensile strength and strain increase when
   shifting the printing direction from transversal to longitudinal, while
   no effect was observed in HighTemp DL400 resin (further called HTP).},

Title = {Additive manufacturing of polymer derived ceramics: Materials, methods,
   and applications},
Journal = {APL MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Owing to freedom of design, simplicity, and ability to handle complex
   structures, additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing of ceramics
   represents a promising enabling technology and has already been used to
   produce geometrically complex ceramic components and ceramic
   metamaterials. Consequently, novel applications for additively
   manufactured ceramics, which leverage their structural, high
   temperature, and chemical-resistant properties, have been proposed in
   areas ranging from electrical engineering and micro/nanoelectronics to
   chemical engineering to biology. Polymer derived ceramics (PDCs)
   represent a relatively new class of materials within additive
   manufacturing. PDCs enable the development of ceramic parts patterned
   via low-cost polymer 3D printing methods followed by pyrolysis in a high
   temperature process in which the polymer itself forms a ceramic often in
   the absence of any ceramic filler. PDCs have served as a feedstock for
   various 3D printing techniques for which a wide range of physiochemical
   factors can be tailored to optimize the ceramic manufacturing processes.
   In particular, the silicon and carbon-rich polymeric microstructure of
   PDCs offers a high degree of tunability and potential to achieve a
   closely defined combination of functional, thermomechanical, and
   chemical properties. In this review, we cover mechanisms underlying the
   design and manufacture of ceramics via 3D printing and pyrolysis of
   preceramic polymers, focusing on chemical formulations, printing
   technologies, and the mechanical performance of the ceramic network from
   microscale to scale. We also summarize experimental data from the
   literature and present qualitative and quantitative comparisons between
   different AM routes to provide a comprehensive review for 3D printing of
   PDCs and to highlight potential future research.},

Title = {A Novel Additive Manufacturing Method of Cellulose Gel},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Screen-additive manufacturing (SAM) is a potential method for producing
   small intricate parts without waste generation, offering minimal
   production cost. A wide range of materials, including gels, can be
   shaped using this method. A gel material is composed of a
   three-dimensional cross-linked polymer or colloidal network immersed in
   a fluid, known as hydrogel when its main constituent fluid is water.
   Hydrogels are capable of absorbing and retaining large amounts of water.
   Cellulose gel is among the materials that can form hydrogels and, as
   shown in this work, has the required properties to be directly SAM,
   including shear thinning and formation of post-shearing gel structure.
   In this study, we present the developed method of SAM for the
   fabrication of complex-shaped cellulose gel and examine whether
   successive printing layers can be completed without delamination. In
   addition, we evaluated cellulose SAM without the need for support
   material. Design of Experiments (DoE) was applied to optimize the SAM
   settings for printing the novel cellulose-based gel structure. The
   optimum print settings were then used to print a periodic structure with
   micro features and without the need for support material.},

Title = {Rheological behaviour of different composite materials for additive
   manufacturing of 3D bone scaffolds},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-JMR\&T},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {24},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {The production of scaffolds for bone tissue applications is requiring a
   combination of physical and biological properties, which are depending
   on the materials morphology and pro-cessing conditions during the
   production process. The aim of the paper is the inves-tigation of
   rheological behaviour of polymer and composite blends regularly used for
   the production of scaffolds for bone tissue applications with the use of
   additive manufacturing. Poly-\& epsilon;-caprolactone (PCL),
   hydroxyapatite (HA), b-tri-calcium phosphate (TCP) and Bioglass 45S5
   blends containing different ceramic concentrations (10 wt\%, 15 wt\% and
   20 wt\%) were prepared with the use of melt blending procedure and
   investigated with the use of oscil-lation and rotational rheology tests.
   Results are showing that all blends are presenting viscoelastic
   behaviour with higher viscous modulus, compared with elastic modulus for
   low frequencies, with this difference reducing while the frequency is
   increasing. All blends are presenting shear-thinning behaviour suitable
   for use with additive manufacturing methods. Viscous and elastic modulus
   are increasing by adding ceramic particles. Results are presenting that
   PCL/HA blends of the same material concentration are presenting higher
   elastic modulus properties compared with the other blends, while
   PCL/Bioglass blends are presenting lower loss factor, lower relaxation
   time and lower shear viscosity making them easier to handle during the
   printing procedure.\& COPY; 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

   Enhanced In-Orbit Additive Manufacturing Concept},

Abstract = {In-orbit additive manufacturing (AM) is a promising approach for
   fabrication of large structures. It allows to expand and accelerate
   human space exploration possibilities. Extrusion-based AM was
   demonstrated in zero gravity, while the realization of such a process in
   orbit-like vacuum conditions is currently under exploration. Still, a
   solution for protection of the UV and IR radiation sensitive polymers is
   needed in order to prevent their early mechanical failure under space
   conditions. Vacuum arc plasma based process is widely applied on earth
   for thin protective coating deposition. Its major advantage is its
   scalability-from tiny size used in electric propulsion to large scale
   coating devices. The usability of the vacuum arc process in space
   conditions was shown in electric propulsion applications in
   nano-satellites. In this work we discuss and demonstrate the integration
   of vacuum arc process as a post processing step after Fused Filament
   Fabrication (FFF) for additive manufacturing and functionalization of
   long polymer structures. Here we address the concept for technical
   realization, which integrates the vacuum arc into additive manufacturing
   process chain. More over we present a laboratory prototype, which
   implements this concept together with a use case, where a previously
   printed PEEK structure is coated with aluminum based coating suitable
   for UV radiation protection.},

Abstract = {Material extrusion-based additive manufacturing techniques such as fused
   deposition modeling or fused filament fabrication are developing from
   prototyping applications to serial components. The aim of this study is
   to properly characterize an additively manufactured polymer with the
   corresponding process-induced defects. To this effect, varied
   manufacturing orientations of fused filament fabrication were tested
   with a single-batch material manufactured by injection molding serving
   as a reference. Scans were carried out via micro-computed tomography to
   assess the void content and distribution with respect to quality. Local
   material performance was investigated via quasi-static and cyclic tests
   under tensile loading. The quasi-static tensile tests indicated a
   significant reduction of Young's modulus, tensile strength, and strain
   at fracture for the additively manufactured polymer. The mechanical
   investigations with cyclic loading intensified this trend of clear
   reduced mechanical properties due to process-induced defects. The
   quality assessment revealed void volume contents of the additively
   manufactured polymer of up to 6.5\% and a void distribution dependent on
   manufacturing orientation. The results of this study are valuable as
   design guidelines for highly stressed components and serve as a basis
   for further characterizations of process-induced defects.},

Title = {Additive Manufacturing of Polymer Matrix Composite Materials with
   Aligned or Organized Filler Material: A Review},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The ability to fabricate polymer matrix composite materials with
   continuous or discontinuous filler material, oriented in a
   user-specified direction, enables implementing designer material
   properties, such as anisotropic mechanical, thermal, and electrical
   properties. Conventional fabrication methods rely on a mold, which
   limits specimen geometry and is difficult to implement. In contrast,
   additive manufacturing, including fused filament fabrication or fused
   deposition modeling, direct ink writing, or stereolithography, combined
   with a method to align filler material such as a mechanical force or an
   electric, magnetic, shear force, or ultrasound wave field, enables 3D
   printing polymer matrix composite material specimens with complex
   geometry and aligned filler material, without the need for a mold.
   Herein, we review the combinations of fabrication and filler material
   alignment methods used to fabricate polymer matrix composite materials,
   in terms of operating and design parameters including size, resolution,
   print speed, filler material alignment time, polymer matrix and filler
   material requirements, and filler manipulation requirements. The
   operating envelope of each fabrication method is described and their
   advantages, disadvantages, and limitations are discussed. Finally,
   different combinations of 3D printing and filler material alignment
   methods in the context of important engineering applications, such as
   structural materials, flexible electronics, and shape-changing
   materials, are illustrated.},

Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Complex shaped boron carbide with carbon (B4C/C) at near-full densities
   were achieved for the first time using negative additive manufacturing
   techniques via gelcasting. Negative additive manufacturing involves 3D
   printing of sacrificial molds used for casting negative copies. B4C
   powder distributions and rheology of suspensions were optimized to
   successfully cast complex shapes. In addition to demonstrating
   scalability of these complex geometries, hierarchically meso-porous
   structures were also shown to be possible from this technique.
   Resorcinol Formaldehyde (RF) polymer was selected as the gelling agent
   and can also pyrolyze into a carbon aerogel network to act as the
   sintering aid for B4C. Due to the highly effective distribution of in
   situ carbon for the B4C matrix, near-full sintered density of 97-98\% of
   theoretical maximum density was achieved. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) holds tremendous promise in terms of
   revolutionizing manufacturing. However, fundamental hurdles limit the
   widespread adoption of this technology. First, production rates are
   extremely low. Second, the physical size of the parts is generally
   small, less than a cubic foot. Third, the mechanical properties of the
   polymer parts are generally poor, limiting the potential for direct part
   replacement and functional use of the polymer components. This article
   describes various ways in which carbon fibers (CFs) can be used to
   address these fundamental hurdles. First, CF-reinforced polymers
   developed for AM have demonstrated specific strengths approaching
   aerospace-quality aluminum. Second, CF additions can radically reduce
   the distortion and warping of the material during deposition, which
   enables large-scale, out-of-the-oven, high deposition rate
   manufacturing. Finally, the complementary nature of CF technology and AM
   is discussed, showing how merging the two manufacturing processes
   enables the construction of complex components that would not be
   possible with either technology alone.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing is becoming more and more important today by
   offering very advantageous opportunities. It gives the ability to
   manufacture parts with complex geometry, without the need of specific
   tools. This work focuses on fused filament fabrication process. It
   consists in melting the polymer, and extruding it through a nozzle to
   create a structure defined by a toolpath. The extruded filament
   solidifies while cooling. One of the major drawbacks of this process is
   the poor mechanical properties of the parts compared to thermoplastic
   injection. This is related to (i) the porosities between deposited
   filaments and (ii) the limited adhesion between deposited layers. This
   adhesion phenomenon is thermally driven by the molecular mobility of the
   polymer chains. The objective of this work is to understand, model and
   quantify heat exchanges in the process, in order to define the process
   window leading to optimal mechanical resistance of the parts. With this
   aim, a laboratory-scale instrumented 3D printing machine has been
   designed and manufactured. This bench is thermally controlled. Polymer
   and environment temperatures can be measured with an infrared camera,
   pyrometer and thermocouples instrumentation. In parallel, a numerical
   model has been developed to predict the influence of the process
   parameters on the cooling and adhesion. For this purpose, thermal
   properties have been characterized. A sensitivity analysis quantifies
   the most relevant properties to measure and control accurately and a
   comparison between numerical and experimental results validates the
   approach. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. Peer-review

Abstract = {3D printing has been identified as the main technique for the coming
   Industry 4.0 due to its cyber-physical systems and the ability to create
   complicated 3D object in a fast yet accurate manner. However, the
   polymers-based 3D printings are currently mainly used for prototype or
   mold printing due to the lack of functional polymer resins. Functional
   3D printing has been one of the most important goal of scientific
   research and industry development. In the present work, we developed the
   3D printable resin which allows the printing of 3D structures with
   photochromic properties, that is, their color can change reversibly with
   different light irradiation. By using the reversible photochromic
   properties, we developed the secondary printing technology that allows
   the printing of multicolor and different color patterns on the
   as-printed 3D structures. This will be of great importance and indeed
   for applications in jewelry design, UV indicator, optically modulated
   sensors, smart windows, display, package indicators, and so on.},

Title = {Finite element modelling of fully-coupled flow/fiber-orientation effects
   in polymer composite deposition additive manufacturing nozzle-extrudate
   flow},
Journal = {COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {219},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {This paper presents a Finite Element Method (FEM) based algorithm to
   simulate the mutually dependent effects between non-Newtonian polymer
   melt flow and fiber orientation in Polymer Composite Deposition Additive
   Manufacturing (PCDAM). The computational approach is employed to analyze
   an axisymmetric flow with a free surface that defines the melt
   extrudate. The non-Newtonian power law model is applied to quantify the
   shear thinning rheological behavior of the polymer flow. The fiber
   orientation state of the composite melt is simulated using the
   Advani-Tucker orientation tensor approach, and a streamline-based
   remeshing technique is applied to compute die swell of the free
   extrudate. The non-linear FEM system is solved with the Newton Raphson
   iteration method. Computed results are compared to those obtained using
   a flow-fiber one way coupling simulation, where it is shown that the
   magnitude of flow field along the direction of extrusion, as well as the
   fiber alignment in the flow direction, both increase when full coupling
   is used. In addition, the extrudate swell ratio solved by the
   fully-coupled scheme reduces by roughly a factor of similar to 2 x as
   compared to the weakly-coupled flow solution.},

Title = {Mechanical reinforcement of additive-manufactured constructs using in
   situ auxiliary heating process},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The material extrusion (ME) process, which is an additive manufacturing
   technology applicable to a wide range of polymers, has a drawback in
   that the inherent bonding between the deposited layers is vulnerable. To
   this end, we present an efficient strengthening method for the ME
   process by introducing bidirectional in situ infrared (IR) heating
   during the polymer melt deposition in the 3D-printing process. The
   auxiliary IR irradiation was applied to heat as-printed polymers in the
   deposited area along the printing paths at their glass transition
   temperature, which expectedly led to molecular diffusion and chain
   re-entanglement at the deposited interface. Consequently, the heating
   technique not only helped eliminate the structural defects due to the
   thermal stress but also helped enhance the mechanical strength,
   particularly of structures layered in transverse and upright directions.
   The reinforcement effects were confirmed by conducting tensile tests and
   thermal imaging analysis on typical polymers such as polylactic acid and
   polycarbonate. The experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of
   the proposed heating technique in extending the applicability of a wide
   range of engineering plastics or composite materials for the ME printing
   method.},

Abstract = {In this work, we report the fabrication of Silicon infiltrated Silicon
   Carbide (SiSiC) components by a hybrid additive manufacturing process.
   Selective laser sintering of polyamide powders was used to 3D print a
   polymeric preform with controlled relative density, which allows
   manufacturing geometrically complex parts with small features.
   Preceramic polymer infiltration with a silicon carbide precursor
   followed by pyrolysis (PIP) was used to convert the preform into an
   amorphous SiC ceramic, and five PIP cycles were performed to increase
   the relative density of the part. The final densification was achieved
   via liquid silicon infiltration (LSI) at 1500 degrees C, obtaining a
   SiSiC ceramic component without change of size and shape distortion. The
   crystallization of the previously generated SiC phase, with associated
   volume change, allowed to fully infiltrate the part leading to an almost
   fully dense material consisting of beta-SiC and Si in the volume
   fraction of 45\% and 55\% respectively. The advantage of this approach
   is the possibility of manufacturing SiSiC ceramics directly from the
   preceramic precursor, without the need of adding ceramic powder to the
   infiltrating solution. This can be seen as an alternative AM approach to
   Binder jetting and direct ink writing for the production of templates to
   be further processed by silicon infiltration.},

Abstract = {The spread of additive technologies from prototyping to manufacturing
   has made the development of new products possible, but still needs
   effective methods in order to allow their characterization. In
   particular, porosity is considered a crucial aspect of AM products. A
   prototype system for the deposition of continuous carbon
   fiber-reinforced polymers with a thermoplastic matrix has been recently
   developed at Mechanical Engineering Department of Politecnico di Milano.
   This application is of interest, as it would avoid the expensive
   development and manufacturing of specific molds. The mechanical
   performance of the manufactured components depends mainly on porosity
   and on non-correct adhesion among filaments, even in the case of
   conventional manufacturing processes. The additive deposition shows even
   more relevant issues of this kind. Hence the need for a characterization
   of the process. The conventional approach considers a destructive test
   to characterize the composite mechanical properties or porosity. The aim
   of this paper is proposing original approaches to evaluate both porosity
   and non-correct adhesion by means of X-Ray computed tomography. The
   method is validated by comparing the porosity with the reference
   destructive method defined in the ASTM D3171 standard. It is also shown
   that the amount of defects is correlated to the mechanical properties of
   the obtained components, thus the approach can be used for a
   non-destructive evaluation of the manufactured parts.},

Title = {Potential for Natural Fiber Reinforcement in PLA Polymer Filaments for
   Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) Additive Manufacturing: A Review},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In this review, the potential of natural fiber and kenaf fiber (KF)
   reinforced PLA composite filament for fused deposition modeling (FDM)
   3D-printing technology is highlighted. Additive manufacturing is a
   material-processing method in which the addition of materials layer by
   layer creates a three-dimensional object. Unfortunately, it still cannot
   compete with conventional manufacturing processes, and instead serves as
   an economically effective tool for small-batch or high-variety product
   production. Being preformed of composite filaments makes it easiest to
   print using an FDM 3D printer without or with minimum alteration to the
   hardware parts. On the other hand, natural fiber-reinforced polymer
   composite filaments have gained great attention in the market. However,
   uneven printing, clogging, and the inhomogeneous distribution of the
   fiber-matrix remain the main challenges. At the same time, kenaf fibers
   are one of the most popular reinforcements in polymer composites.
   Although they have a good record on strength reinforcement, with low
   cost and light weight, kenaf fiber reinforcement PLA filament is still
   seldom seen in previous studies. Therefore, this review serves to
   promote kenaf fiber in PLA composite filaments for FDM 3D printing. To
   promote the use of natural fiber-reinforced polymer composite in AM,
   eight challenges must be solved and carried out. Moreover, some concerns
   arise to achieve long-term sustainability and market acceptability of
   KF/PLA composite filaments.},

Title = {Filament rheological characterization for fused filament fabrication
   additive manufacturing: A low-cost approach},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {47},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is a widely used Additive Manufacturing
   technology with a growing user base. Unfortunately, users of FFF have
   limited resources for easily and cost-efficiently characterizing the
   materials from the ever-expanding polymer filament market. To address
   this issue, we constructed a low-cost device and measuring procedure
   based on the pressure drop in the polymer melt flow through an FFF
   nozzle which is used to compute the filament material rheological
   properties. In this approach, an analytical pressure drop model based on
   the Generalized-Newtonian-Fluid power-law model is employed where the
   consistency and power-law indices are determined from the measured
   pressure drop and volumetric flow rate through a nonlinear regression
   curve fit. The applicability of our device was demonstrated with six
   commercially available FFF filaments (four unfilled polymers and two
   carbon fiber polymer composites) by comparing the predicted viscosity
   model parameters to those obtained from measurements using a commercial
   rotational rheometer. A Filament Flow Index (FFI) capable of
   characterizing the flow of melted filament similar to Melt Flow Index is
   also proposed to assess the extrusion of materials used in FFF part
   fabrication.},

Title = {Additive manufacturing of advanced ceramic materials},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN MATERIALS SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {116},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has the potential to disrupt the ceramic
   industry by offering new opportunities to manufacture advanced ceramic
   components without the need for expensive tooling, thereby reducing
   production costs and lead times and increasing design freedom. Whilst
   the development and implementation of AM technologies in the ceramic
   industry has been slower than in the polymer and metal industries, there
   is now considerable interest in developing AM processes capable of
   producing defect-free, fully dense ceramic components. A large variety
   of AM technologies can be used to shape ceramics, but variable results
   have been obtained so far. Selecting the correct AM process for a given
   application not only depends on the requirements in terms of density,
   surface finish, size and geometrical complexity of the part, but also on
   the nature of the particular ceramic to be processed. This paper
   provides a detailed review of the current state-of-the-art in AM of
   advanced ceramics through a systematic evaluation of the capabilities of
   each AM technology, with an emphasis on reported results in terms of
   final density, surface finish and mechanical properties. An in-depth
   analysis of the opportunities, issues, advantages and limitations
   arising when processing advanced ceramics with each AM technology is
   also provided.},

Title = {Design and additive manufacture of functionally graded structures based
   on digital materials},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Voxel-based multimaterial jetting additive manufacturing allows
   fabrication of digital materials (DMs) at the meso-scale (similar to 1
   mm) by controlling the deposition patterns of soft elastomeric and rigid
   glassy polymers at the voxel-scale (similar to 90 mu m). The digital
   materials can then be used to create heterogeneous functionally graded
   material (FGM) structures at the macro-scale (similar to 10 mm)
   programmed to behave in a predefined manner. This offers huge potential
   for design and fabrication of novel and complex bespoke mechanical
   structures.
   This paper presents a complete design and manufacturing workflow that
   simultaneously integrates material design, structural design, and
   product fabrication of FGM structures based on digital materials. This
   is enabled by a regression analysis of the experimental data on
   mechanical performance of the DMs i.e., Young's modulus, tensile
   strength and elongation at break. This allows us to express the material
   behavior simply as a function of the microstructural descriptors (in
   this case, just volume fraction) without having to understand the
   underlying microstructural mechanics while simultaneously connecting it
   to the process parameters.
   Our proposed design and manufacturing approach is then demonstrated and
   validated in two series of design exercises to devise complex FGM
   structures. First, we design, computationally predict and experimentally
   validate the behavior of prescribed designs of FGM tensile structures
   with different material gradients. Second, we present a design
   automation approach for optimal FGM structures. The comparison between
   the simulations and the experiments with the FGM structures shows that
   the presented design and fabrication workflow based on our modeling
   approach for DMs at meso-scale can be effectively used to design and
   predict the performance of FGMs at macro-scale.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the additive manufacturing process in the

   research because the additive manufacturing processes can produce
   exactly the desired geometry independent of the complexity. In this
   research was development a cell culture device for the production of

   additive manufacturing was evaluated. Well-dispersed PA11/CNT
   nanocomposite powders were processed successfully by laser sintering.
   Compared to the pristine PA11, the fracture toughness of the PA11/CNT
   nanocomposite was enhanced by similar to 54\% by incorporating of only
   0.2 wt\% CNTs. With differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction
   and scanning electron microscope fractography analysis, the
   nanostructure and the toughening mechanism which lead to the toughness
   improvement was well identified and understood.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing allows the integration of shape memory wires into
   polymer matrices. Actuators produced in this way offer a wide range of
   shapes and wire integration appropriate to external loads is feasible.
   To reach this aim, NiTi wires and a polymer matrix may be co-deposited
   simultaneously using an Arburg plastic freeformer. The actuator
   abilities and reliability are largely affected by the load transmission
   between the NiTi wire and the polymer matrix. Therefore, different
   surface treatments are investigated to improve the adhesion. The
   influence of various treatments is quantified by performing pull-out
   tests and evaluating the surface roughness. The biggest impact on the
   interfacial shear strength (ISS) was achieved by a laser gas nitration
   of the wire surface before embedding them in the matrix material. This
   approach increased the ISS by a factor of 11 compared to the initial
   state.},

Abstract = {The combination of Additive Manufacturing (AM) with
   Carbon-Fibre-Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) unlocks potential in the design
   and development of highly integrated lightweight structures. This paper
   introduces two different design potentials, where the combination of AM
   and CFRP can lead to better and lighter hybrid structures: First, Load
   Introductions often show complex superimposed loads and therefore
   lightweight metal alloys become a valuable alternative to CFRP. With AM,
   load-oriented designs that provide a more continuous introduction of the
   load into the fibers become possible. Secondly, tooling for complex
   composite structures is expensive and laborious. Here, inner tooling
   with AM can offer potentials in the design and development of
   complex-shaped composite parts. Within this paper, the potentials are
   highlighted by a case study that consists of the development of a
   Hydraulically actuated Quadruped robot (HyQ) leg. Based on the case
   study, the need for fundamental research in the design and processing of
   structures with AM and CFRP is pointed out in order to pave the way for
   its use in future high performance technological applications.},

Title = {Electrochemical enhancement of carbon black-infused poly(lactic acid)
   filament for additive manufactured electronic applications},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {61},
Month = {JAN 5},
Abstract = {Here we present an electrochemical method to enhance the electrical
   conductivity of commercially available, carbon-black infused polylactic
   acid (PLA) for use in material extrusion-based additive manufacturing
   (MEAM). After fabrication, the carbon-black infused PLA structure was
   processed in aqueous solutions consisting of either hydrochloric acid
   (HCl), nitric acid (HNO3), or sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This study examines
   the effects of acid concentration of the three types of acids, input
   waveform shape applied during the electrochemical process, waveform
   amplitude, and the frequency of the waveforms on the bonding of the
   negatively charged ions to the conductive PLA. We found that inputting a
   DC square pulse in a 7 M H2SO4 solution yielded a 51\% reduction in
   electrical resistance. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis shows that line
   width does shift to lower 2 theta values without affecting the D-spacing
   and the 2 theta peaks decay indicating that the ions introduced through
   the electrochemical doping process are being diffused into the
   conductive workpiece. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) showed
   the presence of sulfur ions located throughout the processed
   carbon-infused PLA, even at the core. Throughout this study, we found
   that this electrochemical process can create electrically in-active dead
   zones that occurs from higher current densities. XRD analysis reveals
   that peaks in these dead zones move to higher 2 theta, rather than lower
   2 theta in the improved areas. This points to a shrinking of the lattice
   structure and verifies that structural changes are occurring.
   Electrically improved areas can be utilized in conjunction with
   electrically in-active dead zones to create conductive areas with
   insulating zones, mimicking copper traces on a PCB. This electrochemical
   process provides the opportunity for fused filament fabrication to be
   used in more electrical applications.},

Title = {Rheology Effects on Predicted Fiber Orientation and Elastic Properties
   in Large Scale Polymer Composite Additive Manufacturing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Short fiber-reinforced polymers have recently been introduced to
   large-scale additive manufacturing to improve the mechanical
   performances of printed-parts. As the short fiber polymer composite is
   extruded and deposited on a moving platform, velocity gradients within
   the melt orientate the suspended fibers, and the final orientation
   directly affects material properties in the solidified extrudate. This
   paper numerically evaluates melt rheology effects on predicted fiber
   orientation and elastic properties of printed-composites in three steps.
   First, the steady-state isothermal axisymmetric nozzle melt flow is
   computed, which includes the prediction of die swell just outside the
   nozzle exit. Simulations are performed with ANSYS-Polyflow, where we
   consider the effect of various rheology models on the computed outcomes.
   Here, we include Newtonian, generalized Newtonian, and viscoelastic
   rheology models to represent the melt flow. Fiber orientation is
   computed using Advani-Tucker fiber orientation tensors. Finally, elastic
   properties in the extrudate are evaluated based from predicted fiber
   orientation distributions. Calculations show that the Phan-Thien-Tanner
   (PTT) model yields the lowest fiber principal alignment among considered
   rheology models. Furthermore, the cross section averaged elastic
   properties indicate a strong transversely isotropic behavior in these
   composites, where generalized Newtonian models yield higher principal
   Young's modulus, while the viscoelastic fluid models result in higher
   shear moduli.},

Abstract = {In this paper we show that, by using a photogrammetry system with and
   without laser speckle, a large range of additive manufacturing (AM)
   parts with different geometries, materials and post-processing textures
   can be measured to high accuracy. AM test artefacts have been produced
   in three materials: polymer powder bed fusion (nylon-12), metal powder
   bed fusion (Ti-6Al-4V) and polymer material extrusion (ABS plastic).
   Each test artefact was then measured with the photogrammetry system in
   both normal and laser speckle projection modes and the resulting point
   clouds compared with the artefact CAD model. The results show that laser
   speckle projection can result in a reduction of the point cloud standard
   deviation from the CAD data of up to 101 mu m. A complex relationship
   with surface texture, artefact geometry and the laser speckle projection
   is also observed and discussed.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing processes allow freeform fabrication of the
   physical representation of a three-dimensional computer-aided design
   (CAD) data model. This area has been expanding rapidly over the last 20
   years. It includes several techniques such as selective laser sintering
   and stereolithography. The range of materials used today is quite
   restricted while there is a real demand for manufacturing lighter
   functional parts or parts with improved functional properties. In this
   article, we summarize recent work performed in this field, introducing
   new composite materials containing complex metallic alloys. These are
   mainly Al-based quasicrystalline alloys whose properties differ from
   those of conventional alloys. The use of these materials allows us to
   produce light-weight parts consisting of either metal-matrix composites
   or of polymer-matrix composites with improved properties. Functional
   parts using these alloys are now commercialized.},

Abstract = {Polymeric composites with multi-functionality offer significant
   advantages over metals, including lightweight, high strength and
   stiffness, corrosion and fatigue resistance, etc. Additively
   manufactured composites draw intensive attention over the past decade
   due to that they exhibit the large potential to extend their
   applications from rapid prototyping to functional end-use components.
   Moreover, advances in additive manufacturing (AM) open new perspectives
   for the next generation of design and manufacturing of composites, which
   possess spatially digitalized and materialized arrangement of
   material/structure in a voxel-by-voxel manner. This review examines the
   work performed in this fast-growing field and elaborates its future
   perspectives and potentials. Specifically, the polymer AM processes
   incorporating different types of reinforcements are discussed in terms
   of mechanism, feedstocks, their advantages, and constraints. Then, the
   AM-driven designs for polymeric composites on multiscale and for
   multi-functional applications are emphasized. Further, emerging research
   topics including digital composites, intelligence/data-driven design
   approaches, and four-dimensional printing are further addressed with the
   careful analysis of existing gaps and future research trends. Finally,
   this review is concluded with an outlook on future research
   opportunities on AM-fabricated composites from design to fabrication.
   This review aims to provide a comprehensive guide to the stakeholders
   who want to utilize or develop an AM process for polymeric composites.},

Abstract = {Deposition processes, such as Wire \& Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM),
   have important perspectives in industry, due to their capacity to
   produce large near-shape parts with high productivity. Beyond
   process-material issues, deposition path planning is one of the major
   challenges to allow a wide use of these processes using multi-axis
   machines or robots. Early CAM software solutions dedicated to multi-axis
   additive manufacturing have been already commercialised. However, few
   elementary deposition strategies are currently available. In this
   article, the possibilities of multi-axis deposition and the developments
   needed to improve deposition path generation are highlighted through the
   analysis of a hollow half-sphere as a case study. Deposition strategies
   are experimentally tested on two different robotised polymer deposition
   systems. Based on the comparison of the trials, the issues related to
   the portability of technology from a specific machine setup to a
   different one are discussed. Finally, a framework for future
   Computer-Aided Multi-Axis Additive Manufacturing (CAMAAM) software is
   proposed. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an

Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Selective laser sintering (SLS) is one of the most popular industrial
   polymer additive manufacturing processes with applications in aerospace,
   biomedical, tooling, prototyping, and beyond. SLS is capable of creating
   unique, functional parts with little waste and no tooling by using a
   high-powered laser to selectively melt powdered polymer into desired
   shapes. This process relies heavily on understanding and controlling the
   thermodynamics of the polymer melt process. One of the biggest
   challenges SLS faces is lack of adequate process control, which leads to
   comparatively high component variations. It has been shown that
   implementing more advanced laser control techniques enable a higher
   level of control over the processing temperatures and lead to more
   uniform components. Currently, there are no commercial options for a
   laser power controller that allows continuously variable power to be
   used as a galvanometer system adjusts the laser position. This paper
   will also discuss the development and implementation of a galvanometer
   controller solution that works in conjunction with an off-the-shelf unit
   to enable this crucial functionality and will present results showing
   that, when applied to the SLS process, a 33 \% reduction in thermal
   variation was achieved.},

Title = {Additive manufacturing and advanced functionalities of cardiac patches:
   A review},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {174},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {Cardiac patches made up of polymer scaffolds and heart muscle cells have
   received great attention as a promising construct to repair damaged
   heart tissue and improve its function. There are various techniques,
   including solvent casting, electrospinning, and rotary-jet spinning,
   which are widely used for the fabrication of cardiac patches from
   natural, synthetic, or natural/synthetic polymers. However, limited
   control over the structure of patches and poor reproducibility are some
   of the drawbacks associated with these fabrication methods. Currently,
   the development of additive manufacturing 3D bioprinting technology has
   opened a new avenue for tissue engineering applications. 3D bioprinting
   techniques allow the fabrication of cardiac patches with a flexible
   design based on the individual patient's needs to be placed in precise
   geometries as found in native counterparts. Recent research has focused
   on the improvement and implementing various functionalities of cardiac
   patches. Electroconductive, drug delivery, 4D, and shape memory cardiac
   patches are the most recent advances in cardiac patch manufacturing.
   With all these developments, adhesion of the cardiac patches to heart
   tissue with a slippery wet surface and under dynamic forces has been
   challenging. The materials and strategies developed for ideal adhesion
   to the heart tissue are also reviewed in this paper.},

Abstract = {Sustainability is a consideration of resource utilization without
   depletion or adverse environmental impact. In manufacturing, important
   sustainability issues include energy consumption, waste generation,
   water usage and the environmental impact of the manufactured part in
   service. This paper deals with three aspects of sustainability as it
   applies to additive manufacturing. First is a review of the research
   needs for energy and sustainability as applied to additive manufacturing
   based on the 2009 Roadmap for Additive Manufacturing Workshop. The
   second part is an energy assessment for selective laser sintering (SLS)
   of polymers. Using polyamide powder in a 3D Systems Vanguard HiQ
   Sinterstation, energy loss during a build was measured due to the
   chamber heaters, the roller mechanism, the piston elevators and the
   laser. This accounted for 95\% of the total energy consumption. An
   overall energy assessment was accomplished using eco-indicators. The
   last topic is electrochemical deposition of porous SLS non-polymeric
   preforms. The goal is to reduce energy consumption in SLS of
   non-polymeric materials. The approach was to mix a transient binder with
   the material, to create an SLS green part, to convert the binder, and
   then to remove the open, connected porosity and to densify the part by
   chemical deposition at room temperature within the pore network. The
   model system was silicon carbide powder mixed with a phenolic transient
   binder coupled with electrolytic deposition of nickel. Deposition was
   facilitated by inserting a conductive graphite cathode in the part
   center to draw the positive nickel ions through the interconnected
   porous network and to deposit them on the pore walls. The Roadmap for
   Additive Manufacturing Workshop was sponsored by the National Science
   Foundation under Grant CMMI-0906212 and by the Office of Naval Research
   under Grant N00014-09-1-0558. The electrolytic deposition research was
   sponsored by the National Science Foundation, Grant CMMI-0926316. (C)

Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},

Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In this study, we explore the deformation of a polymer extrudate upon
   the deposition on a build platform, to determine the bonding widths
   between stacked strands in fused-filament fabrication. The considered
   polymer melt has an extremely high viscosity, which dominates in its
   deformation. Mainly considering the viscous effect, we derive analytical
   expressions of the flat width, compressed depth, bonding width and
   cross-sectional profile of the filament in four special cases, which
   have different combinations of extrusion speed, print speed and nozzle
   height. We further validate the derived relations, using our
   experimental results on acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), as well
   as existing experimental and numerical results on ABS and polylactic
   acid (PLA). Compared with existing theoretical and numerical results,
   our derived analytic relations are simple, which need less calculations.
   They can be used to quickly predict the geometries of the deposited
   strands, including the bonding widths.},

Title = {Design and additive manufacturing of 3D-architected ceramic
   metamaterials with programmable thermal expansion},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {47},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Metamaterials with multiple anisotropic properties have strong potential
   in medicine, military, and civil engineering applications. However,
   previous studies have been limited to the design and fabrication of
   polymers, metals, and alloys, which can allow the retention of the
   structure at low temperatures. Metamaterials that operate at high
   temperatures or over large temperature ranges need to be developed. In
   this study, 3D-architected ceramic metamaterials with programmable
   thermal expansion, which can be used in high-temperature or
   large-temperature-range environments, were designed, fabricated, and
   characterized. First, three multi ceramic
   quadrangular-pyramid-structured metamaterials with programmable thermal
   expansion behaviors were proposed and designed based on ZrO2 and Al2O3
   ceramics. The design mechanism and programmable range of thermal
   expansion were analyzed. Then, 3D-architected ceramic metamaterials with
   negative (-10 x 10(-6)/degrees C), zero (0 x 10(-6)/degrees C), and
   positive (+10 x 10(-6)/degrees C) thermal expansion were designed and
   fabricated through stereolithography additive manufacturing. The
   manufactured 3D-architected multi-ceramic meta materials with
   programmable thermal expansion behaviors were analyzed using a digital
   image correlation (DIC) method. The results showed that the
   experimentally measured values were in good agreement with the
   theoretical values. The obtained findings pave the way for the
   application of 3D-architected multi-ceramic metamaterials.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to provide a review of available published
   literature in which nanostructures are incorporated into AM printing
   media as an attempt to improve the properties of the final printed part.
   The purpose of this article is to summarize the research done to date,
   to highlight successes in the field, and to identify opportunities that
   the union of AM and nanotechnology could bring to science and
   technology.
   Design/methodology/approach - Research in which metal, ceramic, and
   carbon nanomaterials have been incorporated into AM technologies such as
   stereolithography, laser sintering, fused filament fabrication, and
   three-dimensional printing is presented. The results of the addition of
   nanomaterials into these AM processes are reviewed.
   Findings - The addition of nanostructured materials into the printing
   media for additive manufacturing affects significantly the properties of
   the final parts. Challenges in the application of nanomaterials to
   additive manufacturing are nevertheless numerous. Research
   limitations/implications - Each of the AM methods described in this
   review has its own inherent limitations when nanoparticles are applied
   with the respective printing media. Overcoming these design boundaries
   may require the development of new instrumentation for successful AM
   with nanomaterials.
   Originality/value - This review shows that there are many opportunities
   in the marriage of AM and nanotechnology. Promising results have been
   published in the application of nanomaterials and AM, yet significant
   work remains to fully harness their inherent potential. This paper
   serves the purpose to researchers to explore new nanomaterials-based
   composites for additive manufacturing.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing is being used in a variety of ways to support the
   production of complex castings. Some of the common additive
   manufacturing processes include fused filament fabrication, vat
   photopolymerization, powder bed fusion, binder jetting, and material
   jetting. In this paper, the authors discuss the use of (i) binder
   jetting technology to fabricate sand molds for casting complex, cellular
   structures and (ii) fused filament fabrication \& vat
   photopolymerization to produce complex investment casting patterns.
   Binder jetting of foundry sand molds allows the realization of cast
   structures that are impossible to mold using conventional methods. The
   structures are lightweight, multi-functional and may provide exceptional
   blast protection. With regards to investment casting, wax is currently
   the primary material used for producing expendable patterns due to a
   desirable combination of thermal expansion, thermal conductivity and
   melting point. However, wax is not a typical printed material. A variety
   of polymers are available for additive manufacturing and, as would be
   expected, only a few are suitable for use as expendable patterns for
   investment casting. The best polymers for use as expendable patterns for
   investment castings are PMMA, epoxy resin containing a reactive diluent
   and ABS.},

Title = {Photo-polymerization for additive manufacturing of composite solid
   propellants},
Journal = {ACTA ASTRONAUTICA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {182},
Pages = {58-65},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The established state-of-the-art for composite solid propellant grain
   manufacture consists in mix-cast-cure process using hazardous chemicals
   and specific molds for propellant forming. In most of the cases,
   polyaddition of oligomers involves isocyanate functional groups.
   Construction constraints limit the feasibility of propellant geometries,
   confining the pressure-time history of rocket motors to some established
   configurations. Composition pot-life becomes one of the most important
   parameters in the definition of correlated industrial processes. An
   additive manufacturing process for propellant grain production based on
   UV curing has been recently proposed for patenting. This technique
   enables more complex grain geometries, paving the way for new propulsive
   missions, thanks to customized thrust-time profiles or local composition
   fine tuning. The new curative method makes innovative use of
   pre-polymers, replacing isocyanates with UV-sensitive components
   characterized by lower chemical hazard for operators. The paper
   illustrates the experimental results obtained during the preliminary
   test campaign on propellant inert simulators, produced as lab-scale
   proof of concept. The activity targeted mono-layer samples, focusing on
   binder properties. Dynamic-mechanical thermal analysis,
   thermal-gravimetric analysis, and stress-strain tests have been carried
   out to measure mechanical and physical characteristics of different
   formulations. Both hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) and
   polybutadiene diacrylate (PBDDA) binders have been considered, using
   ammonium sulfate as substitute of ammonium perchlorate. Aluminized and
   non-aluminized samples have been manufactured to evaluate the impact of
   opaque-reflective materials during the UV curing process. The reported
   analyses show comparable results for both the new UV-cured materials and
   demonstrate the feasibility of propellants based on isocyanate-free
   process.},

Abstract = {Magnetic field responsive polymer composites find applications in many
   electrical and electronic devices. In this study, composites with
   magnetic fillers were manufactured using a stereolithography based AM
   process. Magnetic suspensions developed with an objective of controlling
   particle settling were characterized for rheological properties. A
   stereolithography based commercial 3D printer was utilized to fabricate
   components using the developed magnetic suspensions. Resulting magnetic
   composite structures were characterized using scanning electron
   microscopy, a coordinate measuring machine and Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy. Through this research an enhanced understanding
   of filler modified polymers development, material behaviour and the
   process for manufacturing magnetic field responsive composites using
   stereolithography is obtained. (C) 2019 Society of Manufacturing

Abstract = {Conclusions: This study demonstrates proof of concept for controlled
   manufacturing methods that utilize novel tailored biopolymers (3D
   photocuring technology) or conventional bioresorbable polymers (fused
   deposition modeling, FDM) for macroscopic and microscopic geometry
   control. The manufactured scaffolds could be suitable for tissue
   engineering research. Objectives: To design novel trachea scaffold
   prototypes for tissue engineering purposes, and to fabricate them by
   additive manufacturing. Methods: A commercial 3D model and CT scans of a
   middle-aged man were obtained for geometrical observations and
   measurements of human trachea. Model trachea scaffolds with variable
   wall thickness, interconnected pores, and various degrees of porosity
   were designed. Photocurable polycaprolactone (PCL) polymer was used with
   3D photocuring technology. Thermoplastic polylactide (PLA) and PCL were
   used with FDM. Cell cultivations were performed for biocompatibility
   studies. Results: Scaffolds of various sizes and porosities were
   successfully produced. Both thermoplastic PLA and PCL and photocurable
   PCL could be used effectively with additive manufacturing technologies
   to print high-quality tubular porous biodegradable structures. Optical
   microscopic and SEM images showed the viability of cells. The cells were
   growing in multiple layers, and biocompatibility of the structures was
   shown.},

Abstract = {Lithium ion battery electrodes were manufactured using a new additive
   manufacturing process based on dry powders. By using dry powder based
   process, solvent and drying process used in conventional battery process
   can be removed which allows large-scale Li-ion battery production be
   more economically viable in markets such as automotive energy storage
   systems. Thermal activation time has been greatly reduced due to the
   time and resource demanding solvent evaporation process needed with
   slurry-cast electrode manufacturing being replaced by a hot rolling
   process. It has been found that thermal activation time to induce
   mechanical bonding of the thermoplastic polymer to the remaining active
   electrode particles is only a few seconds. By measuring the surface
   energies of various powders and numerical simulation of powder mixing,
   the powder mixing and binder distribution, which plays a vital role in
   determining the quality of additive manufactured battery electrodes,
   have been predicted and compared favorably with experiments.},

Abstract = {Using additive manufacturing (AM), in this article, we show the dynamic
   mixing of polymer ceramic composite materials during the 3-D printing
   process. Using this in situ mixing strategy, we print polyimide and
   barium titanate (BaTiO (3)) nanocomposite films with variable levels of
   ceramic loading. This is accomplished with multimaterial aerosol jet
   printing. The relative dielectric constant and loss tangent of these
   composite materials are characterized using two ring resonator circuits
   designed for the first resonance below 12 and 110 GHz, respectively.
   This yields material characterization results from the X-band to the
   W-band. We use these results to estimate the ceramic loading by volume
   in the composites. In addition, we use scanning electron microscopy and
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to characterize the dispersion and
   ceramic loading of the composite films. Using this process, we
   demonstrate a range of relative dielectric constants from 3.1 to 8.9. To
   demonstrate the capabilities of this process, a continuous gradient of
   material is also shown in a printed film. Finally, we demonstrate a
   slightly modified process in order to lower the loss characteristics of
   the printed films to provide insight into the loss mechanisms. By mixing
   composites in situ, we are able to dynamically alter the ceramic loading
   of the printed material without formulating multiple inks and pattern
   3-D structures without the use of photosensitive materials. This allows
   us to manufacture material gradients and patterns that would otherwise
   be impractical to fabricate using conventional microfabrication. Using
   composite mixing in place adds a new dimension to the flexibility and
   capability of AM.},

Title = {Material Extrusion-Based Additive Manufacturing with Blends of

Journal = {ACS APPLIED POLYMER MATERIALS},
Year = {2020},

Pages = {911-921},

Abstract = {Filament-based material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEAM) is one
   of the most commonly used techniques in additive manufacturing (AM). In
   spite of recent notable development in the MEAM process, there is still
   a need to develop more materials that can be printed consistently using
   this technique. Isotactic polypropylene (PP), a popular thermoplastic
   material, undergoes rapid crystallization and subsequent volume
   contraction. This can lead to residual stress buildup in PP parts when
   processed using MEAM, resulting in poor adhesion to the printing
   platform, poor geometric tolerance, and mechanical performance. In this
   work, the effects of varying composition of low molecular weight
   hydrocarbon resins incorporated to PP are investigated. Specifically,
   the thermal behavior, crystallization, morphology, and printability of
   the blends are studied. The rapid crystallization of PP has been delayed
   by the addition of hydrocarbon resins that provided a larger time window
   for the residual stresses to relax. The addition of the resins to the
   pure PP matrix lowers the crystallization temperature of PP from 121.8
   to 116.0 degrees C, which further enables additional diffusion during
   the solidification process. Polarized optical microscopy demonstrates
   the differences in crystalline morphology, which is expected to impact
   the structure at the interlayer boundaries between deposited layers. The
   combination of modifications in crystallization rate, time, and
   morphology significantly affects the interlayer adhesion and residual
   stress state, which directly controls the mechanical properties and part
   warpage of printed parts. Tensile bars of the different blends were
   printed in two different orientations to analyze the mechanical
   performance and study part anisotropy. The maximum tensile stress of
   pure PP (26.8 +/- 2.1 MPa) printed at a +/- 45 degrees raster angle
   increased with addition of 20 wt \% hydrocarbon resin (32.4 +/- 3.0 MPa)
   when printed under the same conditions. The improvement in the tensile
   strength is due to a combination of changes in crystallinity,
   morphology, and improved interlayer adhesion during printing. The parts
   were annealed postprinting to improve polymer chain diffusion across the
   layers, thereby improving interlayer adhesion and resulting in tensile
   modulus and strength values in excess of 90\% of injection-molded PP
   parts.},

Title = {Numerical analysis of screw swirling effects on fiber orientation in
   large area additive manufacturing polymer composite deposition},
Journal = {COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {177},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Large Area Additive Manufacturing (LAAM) polymer deposition employs a
   single screw extruder to deliver pelletized feedstock resulting in
   significantly higher flow rates as compared to conventional
   filament-based extrusion additive processes. Swirling kinematics in LAAM
   melt flow that result from the screw rotation generate unique particle
   alignment patterns within the fiber-filled polymer during deposition
   processing. This paper investigates the effect of the single screw
   swirling motion on the resulting fiber orientation in a short fiber
   polymer composite extrudate. An axisymmetric non-Newtonian viscoelastic
   flow is simulated with the finite element method, where the flow nearby
   the extruder screw tip, within the printing nozzle, and a short section
   of free extrudate compose the flow domain. Fiber orientation tensors
   within the flow domain are evaluated using the Wang-O'Gara-Tucker
   Reduced Strain Closure (RSC) fiber orientation diffusion model with the
   orthotropic fitted closure. The results indicate that swirling
   kinematics yield a longer flow path for fibers to travel and orientate
   within the flow domain, yielding orientation tensor results that are
   notably different as compared to a non-swirl event. The predicted
   principal elastic constant from the swirling flow and non-swirling flow
   models exhibit 21\% difference, and those from the swirling model using
   the RSC closure shows a good agreement with reported experimental data
   for a similar material system.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore the applications of 3D
   printing in space sectors. The authors have highlighted the potential
   research gap that can be explored in the current field of study.
   Three-dimensional (3D) printing is an additive manufacturing technique
   that uses metallic powder, ceramic or polymers to build simple/complex
   parts. The parts produced possess good strength, low weight and
   excellent mechanical properties and are cost-effective. Therefore,
   efforts have been made to make the adoption of 3D printing successful in
   space so that complex parts can be manufactured in space. This saves a
   considerable amount of both time and carrying cost. Thereof the
   challenges and opportunities that the space sector holds for additive
   manufacturing is worth reviewing to provide a better insight into
   further developments and prospects for this technology.
   Design/methodology/approach The potentiality of 3D printing for the
   manufacturing of various components under space conditions has been
   explained. Here, the authors have reviewed the details of manufactured
   parts used for zero-gravity missions, subjected to onboard international
   space station conditions and with those manufactured on earth. Followed
   by the major opportunities in 3D printing in space which include
   component repair, material characterization, process improvement and
   process development along with the new designs. The challenges like
   space conditions, availability of power in space, the infrastructure
   requirements and the quality control or testing of the items that are
   being built in space are explained along with their possible mitigation
   strategies. Findings These components are well comparable with those
   prepared on earth which enables a massive cost saving. Other than the
   onboard manufacturing process, numerous other components as well as a
   complete robot/satellite for outer space applications were manufactured
   by additive manufacturing. Moreover, these components can be recycled
   onboard to produce feedstock for the next materials. The parts produced
   in space are bought back and compared with those built on earth. There
   is a difference in their nature, i.e. the flight specimen showed a
   brittle nature, and the ground specimen showed a denser nature.
   Originality/value This review discusses the advancements of 3D printing
   in space and provides numerous examples of the applications of 3D
   printing in space and space applications. This paper is solely dedicated
   to 3D printing in space. It provides a breakthrough in the literature as
   a limited amount of literature is available on this topic. This paper
   aims at highlighting all the challenges that additive manufacturing
   faces in the space sector and also the future opportunities that await
   development.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) alias 3D printing translates computer-aided
   design (CAD) virtual 3D models into physical objects. By digital slicing
   of CAD, 3D scan, or tomography data, AM builds objects layer by layer
   without the need for molds or machining. AM enables decentralized
   fabrication of customized objects on demand by exploiting digital
   information storage and retrieval via the Internet. The ongoing
   transition from rapid prototyping to rapid manufacturing prompts new
   challenges for mechanical engineers and materials scientists alike.
   Because polymers are by far the most utilized class of materials for AM,
   this Review focuses on polymer processing and the development of
   polymers and advanced polymer systems specifically for AM. AM techniques
   covered include vat photopolymerization (stereolithography), powder bed
   fusion (SLS), material and binder jetting (inkjet and aerosol 3D
   printing), sheet lamination (LOM), extrusion (FDM, 3D dispensing, 3D
   fiber deposition, and 3D plotting), and 3D bioprinting. The range of
   polymers used in AM encompasses thermoplastics, thermosets, elastomers,
   hydrogels, functional polymers, polymer blends, composites, and
   biological systems. Aspects of polymer design, additives, and processing
   parameters as they relate to enhancing build speed and improving
   accuracy, functionality, surface finish, stability, mechanical
   properties, and porosity are addressed. Selected applications
   demonstrate how polymer-based AM is being exploited in lightweight
   engineering, architecture, food processing, optics, energy technology,
   dentistry, drug delivery, and personalized medicine. Unparalleled by
   metals and ceramics, polymer-based AM plays a key role in the emerging
   AM of advanced multifunctional and multimaterial systems including
   living biological systems as well as life-like synthetic systems.},

Title = {Material extrusion additive manufacturing of low-viscosity metallic
   feedstocks: Performances of the plunger-based approach},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Number = {A},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In recent years, increasing attention has been directed at the material
   extrusion additive manufacturing of highly-filled polymers (MEAM-HP).
   This is because conventional polymer 3D printers, which are low cost and
   readily available, can easily be adapted for use with metal
   powder-filled polymer filaments. However, fabricating the latter is
   time-consuming and their formulations differ from regular metal
   injection molding (MIM) feedstocks by lower powder solids loadings and
   higher elastomer contents, thus requiring significant efforts to
   optimize their debinding and sintering conditions. Favorably, other
   types of MEAM-HP printers, such as screw- and piston-based ones, can
   process available MIM feedstocks and apply the debinding and sintering
   procedures that have already been optimized. In this study, a novel ram
   extruder-based printer with a 100 mm-diameter -250 mm-high build volume
   was developed to print a low-viscosity MIM feedstock composed of 65\% of
   17-4PH powder, 23 \% of paraffin wax, 10\% of ethylene vinyl acetate and
   2 \% of stearic acid (all in vol\%). The printer calibration and the
   process optimization procedures are detailed herein. The kinematic
   accuracy of the build platform revealed a maximum deviation of 29 and 92
   mu m in the vertical (Z) and horizontal (XY) directions, respectively.
   Prior to printing, a relative feedstock density of 99.8 \% was obtained
   using a one-minute degassing procedure. During printing, a 52.5 degrees
   C build platform temperature was used and an 85 degrees C extrusion
   temperature conferred to the feedstock a viscosity of 142 Pas at a shear
   strain rate of 180 s(-1) (empty set0.4 mm E3D V6 nozzle, 1 mm(3)/s flow
   rate). Indirect measurements of the extrusion pressure using a load cell
   positioned under the piston allowed to maximize the accuracy of
   start/stop extrusion sequences by adjusting the retraction volumes. An
   overlap printing path technique was introduced to eliminate typical MEAM
   voids between printed lines. Finally, six parts exhibiting complex
   geometries were printed to validate the capacity of the printer to
   produce functional components using conventional low-viscosity MIM
   feedstocks.},

Abstract = {Polymers are the greatest innovation of the millennium. Due to their low
   price, ease of manufacture, resistance to water and versatility,
   polymers have several applications in different domestic and industrial
   sectors. Digital fabrication technology which is also referred to as 3D
   printing or additive Manufacturing (AM) is used for creating physical
   components from a geometrical representation by step-by-step addition of
   materials. This review paper elaborates on the use of polymers for Rapid
   Manufacturing. One such material used is Shape Memory Polymers that have
   been analyzed as Smart Materials (4D Printing Materials). Polymers such
   as Thermoplastics, elastomers, thermosets, and polymers with integrated
   fillers, bio-polymers, and polymers blended with biological materials
   come under the range of other polymeric materials used in AM. The
   quality evaluations that are performed are based on mechanical
   properties, part density and temperature stability. Polycarbonates (PC),
   acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polyether-ester ketone (PEEK),
   polyetherimide (ULTEM) and Nylon are usually utilized polymers in
   measures which need thermoplastics, or plastics treated by warming to a
   semi-fluid state and near the softening point. Properties of materials
   were reviewed for example, Strength parameters of a specific list of
   Polymeric Materials used in 3D printing was revised, where strength
   tests showed that material such as Polybutylene terephthalate has a high
   Yield Strength and Polypropylene has a high Ultimate Tensile Strength.
   Special characteristics such as Water Solubility, Shape Memory and
   Corrosion Resistance were reviewed for the ability to choose the ideal
   material for its application. Impact on the Society, Environment and
   Economy, of 3D printing plastics was brushed up from previous surveys in
   order to understand the necessity of growth of this industry.

   fabrication of flexible sensors using digital light processing additive
   manufacturing. In this study, MWCNTs were mixed in thermoplastic
   polyurethane (TPU) photosensitive resin to prepare polymer-matrix
   composites, and a flexible strain sensor was prepared using
   self-developed additive equipment. The results showed that the 1.2 wt\%
   MWCNTs/TPU composite flexible sensor had high gauge factor of 9.988 with
   a linearity up to 45\% strain and high mechanical durability (1000
   cycles). Furthermore, the sensor could be used for gesture recognition

   education and medical applications. In order to predict the mechanical
   behaviour of these components, it is necessary to characterise materials
   according to their manufacturing process. Considering the technology of
   additive manufacturing by ``fused filament fabrication{''} (FFF) or
   ``fused deposition modelling{''} (FDM), and specifically in ``material
   extrusion additive manufacturing{''} (ME-AM), several parameters must be
   defined to produce the required geometries. The infill orientation is
   one of the parameters that most affects mechanical and fracture
   properties of the final components, often causing premature failures.
   Therefore, the objective of this work is to study the influence of
   raster orientation on fracture parameters for thin polymer components.
   For this purpose, double deeply edge-notched tensile (DDEN-T) thin
   specimens have been tested considering the essential work of fracture
   (EWF) approach. The studied material has been polypropylene (PP).
   Experimental results show the influence of filament orientation on the
   essential work of fracture and the limitations of the EWF approach for
   some of the assessed orientations. Additionally, two different fracture
   mechanisms have been observed and discussed. This work demonstrates the
   importance of optimising the raster orientation during the filament
   deposition layer by layer, depending on the application of the
   manufactured component, to preserve its structural integrity.},

Abstract = {Three-dimensional lattices have applications across a range of fields
   including structural lightweighting, impact absorption and biomedicine.
   In this work, lattices based on triply periodic minimal surfaces were
   produced by polymer additive manufacturing and examined with a
   combination of experimental and computational methods. This
   investigation elucidates their deformation mechanisms and provides
   numerical parameters crucial in establishing relationships between their
   geometries and mechanical performance. Three types of lattice were
   examined, with one, known as the primitive lattice, being found to have
   a relative elastic modulus over twice as large as those of the other
   two. The deformation process of the primitive lattice was also
   considerably different from those of the other two, exhibiting strut
   stretching and buckling, while the gyroid and diamond lattices deformed
   in a bending dominated manner. Finite element predictions of the stress
   distributions in the lattices under compressive loading agreed with
   experimental observations. These results can be used to create better
   informed lattice designs for a range of mechanical and biomedical
   applications. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Mechanical properties of hexagonal lattice structures fabricated using
   continuous liquid interface production additive manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a key enabler for architectured lattice
   materials, because of the geometric complexity of parts that can be
   produced. Recent advancements in AM have enabled rapid production
   speeds, high spatial resolution, and a variety of engineering polymers.
   An open question remains whether production grade AM can accurately and
   repeatably produce lattice parts. This study presents design,
   production, and mechanical property testing of hexagonal lattice parts
   manufactured using continuous liquid interface production (CLIP) based
   AM. We printed and tested 84 parts, in three polymer materials having
   relative density ranging from 0.06 to 0.23. Lattice wall structures were
   reliably printed when truss aspect ratio was in the range 5 to 20 and
   wall thicknesses were 0.35 or 0.5 mm. The printed lattice parts, each
   comprising hundreds of slender walls, were measured using high
   resolution optical scanning. The images were analyzed to evaluate the
   difference between the printed parts and their designs, and the effect
   of geometric deviations on the mechanical behavior. The measured elastic
   moduli of the printed parts are close to the values expected from the
   materials specifications. The measured strength of the printed parts
   deviates by 7\% from the behavior predicted from the scanned geometry.
   The failure mode of the printed structures depends upon the material and
   part geometry. To our knowledge, this is the largest study on the
   accuracy and performance of AM lattice parts, and the first study of its
   type for lattice parts made using CLIP.},

Title = {Heat retention modeling of large area additive manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {325-332},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Large Area Additive Manufacturing now enables the fabrication of
   structures that are dramatically more substantial than those produced
   with standard 3D printing. As the use of support structure is generally
   not appropriate when printing at these scales, understanding the limits
   of overhanging feature angles is necessary to establish the economic
   case for using large 3D printing. Additionally, understanding the
   physics of the process is paramount to avoiding expensive failed prints.
   Rapid sequential layers can result in slumping as the structure retains
   excessive heat when the next layer is printed. In this study, the
   thermal profiles of large printed parts have been experimentally
   measured and mathematically modeled in order to assist in the decision
   of whether a delay between layers is required to avoid slumping of
   overhanging features. The model can be used to insert additional dwell
   times after each layer so that the next layer of printing initiates
   after the previous layer is sufficiently cool such that the existing
   structure is appropriately solidified. Inputs to the model include the
   feedstock material, the number of beads in the overhanging wall, the
   angle of overhang and the threshold of failure represented as
   out-of-plane displacement from the intended geometry. The proposed
   thermal model can then be used with slicing software to insert pauses a
   priori, or can be leveraged during the print in conjunction with
   infrared imaging in order to provide in situ process control to improve
   quality and yield.},

   the possibility to fabricate optics with tailored index profiles. The
   index range achieved by the presented approach is considerably higher
   than the common index tuning techniques. Using this technique, a planar
   multilayer STIN lens is fabricated. The index profile of the fabricated
   lens has similar progression to the designed profile. In addition,
   through simulation and also optical characterization, the lensing

   Additive Manufacturing},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},

Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Large format polymer extrusion-based additive manufacturing has been
   studied recently due to its capacity for high throughput, customizable
   bead size and geometry, and ability to manufacture large parts. Samples
   from three fiber-filled amorphous thermoplastic materials 3D printed
   using a Masterprint 3X machine from Ingersoll Machine Tools were
   studied, along with their neat counterparts. Characterization techniques
   included thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC), and thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA). TGA results
   showed that the fillers decreased the degradation temperature for most
   of the materials investigated, with a 30 degrees C decrease for
   polycarbonate (PC) and a 12 degrees C decrease for polyethylene
   terephthalate glycol (PETG). For all the materials used, heat capacity
   increases with increasing temperature. Moreover, results show that a
   highly conductive filler increases the heat capacity. In contrast, a
   material with a lower conductivity decreases the heat capacity indicated
   in the 15.2\% and 2.54\% increase for acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
   (ABS) and PC and a 27.68\% decrease for PETG. The TMA data show that the
   printed bead exhibits directional properties consistent with an
   orthotropic material. Smaller strains and coefficient of thermal
   expansion (CTE) were measured along the bead direction and across the
   bead compared to the through bead thickness showing that fillers are
   predominantly oriented in the bead direction, which is consistent with
   the literature. CTE values through bead thickness and neat material are
   similar in magnitude, which corresponds to the CTE of the matrix
   material. The experimental results serve to characterize the effect of
   fiber filler on the part thermal strains in three principal directions
   and two-part locations during the extrusion and bead deposition of
   large-format polymer extrusion-based additive manufacturing
   technologies.},

   the industry and laboratories, quality controls of these objects have to
   be fulfilled. But these quality controls are challenging compared to
   classical methods of fabrication because of very complex object
   manufacturing, unachievable with standard tools. Consequently, we
   demonstrate terahertz (THz) imaging as an efficient method and THz
   tomography may be considered as a routine control. This paper proposes
   an experimental study of 3D polymer objects obtained by additive
   manufacturing techniques. This approach allows us to characterize
   defects and to control dimensions by volumetric measurements on 3D data
   reconstructed by tomography.},

Abstract = {There exist significant opportunities for the improvement of radiation
   therapy procedures by the development of custom dosimetry phantoms for
   training, quality assurance, and clinical research. Additive manufacture
   enables custom phantom manufacture, however there exist technical
   challenges, namely the lack of specialised materials to mimic radiation
   interaction properties of natural materials, and a lack of automated
   methods to reduce the manual effort required to convert medical scan
   data into an additive component. This work demonstrates a novel approach
   to overcome these challenges to enable the automated manufacture of
   customised radiation dosimetry phantoms using commercial ultraviolet

Abstract = {Electrochemical additive manufacturing (ECAM), basedon
   meniscus-guideddeposition, is an emerging technique for the fabrication
   of conductingpolymers. The ECAM fabrication of polypyrrole entails the
   electrochemicalpolymerization of pyrrole monomers and additive
   manufacturing of polymers.Herein, we investigate the 2-naphthalene
   sulfonic acid sodium salt(NSA-a), sodium naphthalene-2,6-disulfonate
   (NSA-b), and 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzenedisulfonicacid disodium salt
   (Tiron) as anionic dopants for the ECAM processingof polypyrrole. The
   analysis of the dopants, encompassing the electrochemicaltests and
   electron microscopy measurements coupled with energy-levelcalculations,
   provides an insight into the influence of their structureand functional
   groups on polypyrrole depositions. The increase inthe charge/mass ratio
   of the dopant results in lower deposition potential,higher deposition
   rate, and reduced particle agglomeration. Atomicforce microscopy tests
   reveal that the employment of Tiron demonstratesimproved deformation
   tolerance with stronger adhesion due to the chelatingproperties. The
   high electronic conductivity of Tiron-doped polypyrroleis attributed to
   multiple -SO3 (-) groups, which enhance the interchain mobility of
   charge carriers.Tiron-doped polypyrrole micropillars are successfully
   produced viapulling of the meniscus. The findings present an opportunity
   for theoptimization and engineering of ECAM fabrications.},

Abstract = {In order to develop extrudable polymer composites for additive
   manufacturing some mechanical and tribological properties of
   polymer-polymeric mixtures of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene
   (UHMWPE) and polypropylene (PP) have been investigated. The problem of
   selecting rational compositions with the aim of improving the
   manufacturability (extrudability) of UHMWPE was solved. It is shown that
   extrudable 3D-printed UHMWPE composites over their tribomechanical
   properties (wear resistance, friction coefficient, elastic modulus,
   yield point, tensile strength, and elongation at break) exceed those of
   the hot pressing fabricated composite. This is related to more uniform
   ordered permolecular structure formation with increased crystallinity.
   It is shown that the composite ``UHMWPE + 20 wt.\% PP{''} is the most
   efficient from the standpoint of maintaining high tribomechanical
   properties and possessing acceptable melt flow rate (MFR) index.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This review summarizes the most recent advances from technological and
   physico-chemical perspectives to improve several remaining issues in
   polymeric materials' additive manufacturing (AM). Without a doubt, AM is
   experimenting with significant progress due to technological innovations
   that are currently advancing. In this context, the state-of-the-art
   considers both research areas as working separately and contributing to
   developing the different AM technologies. First, AM techniques'
   advantages and current limitations are analyzed and discussed. A
   detailed overview of the efforts made to improve the two most
   extensively employed techniques, i.e., material extrusion and
   VAT-photopolymerization, is presented. Aspects such as the part size,
   the possibility of producing parts in a continuous process, the
   improvement of the fabrication time, the reduction of the use of
   supports, and the fabrication of components using more than one material
   are analyzed. The last part of this review complements these
   technological advances with a general overview of the innovations made
   from a material perspective. The use of reinforced polymers, the
   preparation of adapted high-temperature materials, or even the
   fabrication of metallic and ceramic parts using polymers as supports are
   considered. Finally, the use of smart materials that enable the
   fabrication of shape-changing 3D objects and sustainable materials will
   also be explored.},

Title = {Droplet-on-demand metal additive manufacturing using a magnetostrictive

Abstract = {The molten metal droplet-on-demand (MMDoD) mechanism is one of the many
   advanced ways to achieve metal additive manufacturing (AM). A novel
   MMDoD mechanism is designed and developed using a magnetostrictive
   actuator to achieve a desktop-based metal AM system using a low input
   voltage circuit. The MMDoD mechanism further includes the use of a
   thermally insulating piston to protect the actuator from the heat of the
   molten metal pool. The oscillation of the piston in the MMDoD mechanism
   is used to generate the molten metal droplets. To generate reproducible
   molten metal droplets with the least geometrical variations, the effect
   of the input signal pulse shape, the input signal voltage amplitude, and
   stand-off distance between piston and nozzle entrance on the MMDoD
   mechanism performance is studied using high-speed videography. The input
   signal pulse shape is selected to be either the unfiltered signal (UFS)
   and low pass filtered signal (LPFS). Using UFS and LPFS, a parametric
   study of molten metal droplets size and its variation is conducted by
   varying the stand-off distance between the piston and nozzle and input
   signal voltage amplitude across the magnetostrictive actuator. To
   demonstrate the metal additive manufacturing using this system, a study
   is conducted to find the optimal gap between each droplet. Using the
   MMDoD system, molten metal droplets of uniform shape (571 mu m) are
   ejected at fixed generation rate and deposited with an optimal gap to
   print conductive traces on a polymer substrate. As these conductive
   lines were printed using metal on polymer substrate, they could provide
   a new way to connect the electronic components to achieve AM of the
   electronic circuits.},

Title = {Mechanical Recyclability of Polypropylene Composites Produced by
   Material Extrusion-Based Additive Manufacturing},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Due to a lack of long-term experience with burgeoning material
   extrusion-based additive manufacturing technology, also known as fused
   filament fabrication (FFF), considerable amounts of expensive material
   will continue to be wasted until a defect-free 3D-printed component can
   be finalized. In order to lead this advanced manufacturing technique
   toward cleaner production and to save costs, this study addresses the
   ability to remanufacture a wide range of commercially available
   filaments. Most of them either tend to degrade by chain scission or
   crosslinking. Only polypropylene (PP)-based filaments appear to be
   particularly thermally stable and therefore suitable for multiple
   remanufacturing sequences. As the extrusion step exerts the largest
   influence on the material in terms of temperature and shear load, this
   study focused on the morphological, rheological, thermal, processing,
   tensile, and impact properties of a promising PP composite in the course
   of multiple consecutive extrusions as well as the impact of additional
   heat stabilizers. Even after 15 consecutive filament extrusions, the
   stabilized additively manufactured PP composite revealed an unaltered
   morphology and therefore the same tensile and impact strength as the
   initial material. As the viscosity of the material of the 15th extrusion
   was nearly identical to that of the 1st extrusion sequence, the
   processability both in terms of extrusion and FFF was outstanding,
   despite the tremendous amount of shear and thermal stress that was
   undergone. The present work provides key insights into one possible step
   toward more sustainable production through FFF.},

Title = {Additive manufacturing of polymeric scaffolds for biomimetic cell
   membrane engineering},
Journal = {MATERIALS \& DESIGN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {201},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing based on direct laser writing two-photon
   polymerization facilitates the fabrication of microstructures with full
   3D design freedom. Here, this fabrication technique is exploited for
   engineering scaffolds accurately mimicking the shape and size of three
   types of human cells. The human cell models employed in the study were
   chosen to include a range of dimensions and different identifiable
   features to highlight the versatility of this fabrication approach, yet
   other cell shapes can easily be fabricated in similar manner. The design
   and fabrication parameters for the additive manufacturing process were
   optimized to obtain polymeric scaffolds with biomimetic shapes. After
   fabrication, the cell scaffolds were converted to polymer-cushioned
   model cell membranes through layer-by layer functionalization with a
   cationic polymer and a lipid bilayer. Scaffold functionalization was
   verified using con focal laser scanning microscopy. Polymer-cushioned
   model cell membranes supported on 3D scaffolds mimicking the shape of
   human cells are particularly suitable for membrane interaction studies
   where membrane curvature plays an important role. The aim of this study
   is to demonstrate the engineering of biomimetic cell membranes by high
   resolution additive manufacturing combined with surface
   functionalization. The interdisciplinary approach highlights the value
   of additive manufacturing as technological solution for challenges
   encountered in biomedical studies.

Title = {Mechanical behaviour and constitutive modelling of an additively
   manufactured stereolithography polymer},
Journal = {MECHANICS OF MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {185},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing enables the production of complex structures not
   possible with traditional methods. Such structures are attractive for
   use in various engineering applications. It follows that knowledge about
   the mechanical response of additive manufactured materials, and how to
   model it numerically, is required. In this work, a polymer manufactured
   with the stereolithography (SLA) method was studied through tensile and
   compression testing of smooth and notched specimens. The material
   exhibited an initial linear elastic behaviour followed by
   strain-rate-and pressure-dependent inelastic flow before failing at
   rather large strains in a brittle fracture mode. Motivated by the
   observed material behaviour, a hyper-viscoelastic constitutive model
   with a brittle fracture criterion was developed, implemented in a
   commercial finite element software, and calibrated to the material
   tests. Compression tests of lattice structures were performed and
   simulated to validate the model's capabilities at complex stress states.
   The model captured the experimentally observed nonlinear stress-strain
   behaviour, and predicted the fracture initiation and a failure mode
   similar to the experimental results.},

Abstract = {Material flow and associated fiber orientation are among the most
   important features in Large Area extrusion deposition Additive
   Manufacturing (LAAM) of short fiber-filled composites. Endeavors have
   been done in 2D flow models, where significant knowledge is achieved in
   explaining the material anisotropy of the deposited composite parts.
   Nevertheless, 2D flow models are limited by a couple of assumptions that
   lose significant characters of the deposition flow. This study is one of
   the first few that employ a 3D flow model which focuses on the
   quasi-steady state of the polymer composite melt flow within the nozzle
   and the subsequent 90-degree turning deposition onto the material
   substrate. The material flow is assumed as a highly viscous Newtonian
   flow. The fiber orientation is evaluated using the advanced pARD-RSC
   fiber orientation tensor evaluation model, via the one-way
   weakly-coupled flow/orientation analysis formulation. Computed results
   show the fiber orientation state on the entire cross-section of a
   deposited bead, which yields a clear view of how the material anisotropy
   is affected by the locally varied fiber orientation. The 3D-flow
   prediction proves that the transverse directional fiber alignments are
   in high degree of similarity as compared to the over-predicted results
   from the simplified 2D planar flows. In addition, the 3D-model results
   exhibit a more favorable agreement with the reported experimental data
   than that yielded by the conventional 2D models.},

Abstract = {Attempts to improve the performance of ceramic parts have recently led
   to advances in their design and in the processes used to tailor these
   parts. Thus, Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies, initially
   developed in the polymers and metals industries, have become of
   increasing interest for shaping ceramic parts. Among AM techniques,
   photopolymerization (referred to as stereolithography (SLA) and
   micro-stereolithography) makes it possible to reach high accuracy that
   matches the design requirements for new applications of ceramics in a
   wide range of fields. The development by means of
   (micro)-stereolithography of complex 3D ceramic parts with improved
   performance requires the mastering of various parameters linked to the
   inorganic-organic system involved in this processing route. This paper
   reports on some recent achievements in the production of ceramics using
   photopolymerization. Some examples of the work performed at the SPCTS
   laboratory to produce complex 3D ceramic parts for applications in the
   fields of information and communication technologies, healthcare and

Title = {Characterization of polyaryletherketone (PAEK) filaments and printed
   parts produced by extrusion-based additive manufacturing},

Abstract = {This study describes a detailed analytical characterization of
   polyaryletherketone (PAEK) polymers used in extrusion-based additive
   manufacturing. The results provide key observations and highlight
   differences between commercially available polymers of the PAEK family,
   specifically polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and polyetherketoneketone
   (PEKK). Results suggest that inherent differences in their molecular
   structure lead to notable differences in terms of their viscoelastic,
   thermal and physical properties. Similarly, direct comparison of the
   properties between parent filaments and three-dimensional printed (3DP)
   parts suggests that, as observed in subtractive processes, the molecular
   structure of the PAEK polymer selected (PEEK or PEKK), as well as the
   inherent physical properties associated with it, determine greatly the
   performance of final 3DP parts. Differential scanning calorimetry
   results suggest that the glass transition temperature (T-g) of PEEK 3DP
   bars (146.8 degrees C) is about 8 degrees C lower than that of the
   parent PEEK filament (154.8 degrees C). These small differences manifest
   greatly in the viscoelastic response after T-g, and the temperature at
   which a decrease in storage modulus is observed occurs consistently at
   lower temperatures in 3DP PEEK bars (ca 130 degrees C) compared to PEEK
   filaments (ca 150 degrees C). In contrast, no observable differences are
   noted between parent filaments and 3DP bars in PEKK polymers. For these
   polymers, the inherent semi-crystalline behavior dominates their thermal
   and viscoelastic response. These structure-property relationships
   provide fundamental understanding to aid in the design and manufacturing
   of several industrial and biomedical applications that could potentially
   leverage the advantages of high-temperature thermoplastic PAEK resins,
   as well as in the incorporation of these polymers in a growing number of
   technologies encompassing the field of additive manufacturing. (c) 2021

Abstract = {Carbon fiber (CF)-reinforced thermoplastic composites have been widely
   used in different structural applications due to their superior thermal
   and mechanical properties. The big area additive manufacturing (BAAM)
   system, developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Manufacturing
   Demonstration Facility, has been used to manufacture several composite
   components, demonstration vehicles, molds, and dies. These components
   have been designed and fabricated using various CF-reinforced
   thermoplastics. In this study, the dynamic rheological and mechanical
   properties of a material commonly used in additive manufacturing, 20
   wt\% CF-acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), as well as three
   CF-reinforced high-temperature polymers, 25 wt\% CF-polyphenylsulfone
   (PPSU), 35 wt\% CF-polyethersulfone (PES), and 40 wt\% CF-polyphenylene
   sulfide (PPS), used to print molds were investigated. The viscoelastic
   properties, namely storage modulus, loss modulus, tan delta, and complex
   viscosity, of these composites were studied, and the rheological
   behavior was related to the BAAM extrusion and bead formation process.
   The results showed 20 wt\% CF-ABS and 40 wt\% CF-PPS to display a more
   dominant elastic component at all frequencies tested while 25 wt\%
   CF-PPSU and 35 wt\% CF-PES have a more dominant viscous component. This
   viscoelastic behavior is then used to inform the deposition and bead
   formation process during extrusion on the BAAM system.},

Abstract = {Reinforced polymers have gained a significant interest in the research
   community in recent years due to their enhanced performance as compared
   to their parent polymers. Nanosized reinforcement-based polymer
   composites have shown a considerable enhancement in performance as
   compared to micro-/macro-sized fillers. But achieving a high degree of
   filler alignment in nanocomposites via conventional manufacturing
   techniques continues to be a challenging task. Additive manufacturing
   (AM) is a possible solution to this challenge and has undergone a
   significant development in recent years. AM is an efficient technique to
   fabricate nanocomposites in complex shapes which uses a layer-by-layer
   method to fabricate materials and thereby eliminates the need for
   multi-step processing and the use of fasteners/joints to fabricate
   complex structures. Due to a wide range of properties and the existence
   of carbon in a variety of forms, carbon filler-based polymer matrix
   composites are suitable for applications in several technical sectors.
   AM of carbon-based structures and fiber-reinforced polymer composites
   enables the production of highly customized parts with a high degree of
   filler alignment. AM techniques which are generally employed for the
   fabrication of carbon-based fillers/fiber-reinforced polymer composites
   are fused deposition modeling, stereolithography, direct ink writing and
   selective laser sintering. Although AM techniques are efficient, some
   critical issues such as voids and defects between interlayers, the low
   adhesion strength between filaments, part curling and insufficient
   curing of layers need to be addressed to utilize its full potential.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) processes involve the fabrication of parts
   in a layer-wise manner. The layers of material are deposited using a
   variety of established methodologies, the most popular of which involve
   either the use of a powerful laser to sinter/melt successive layers of
   metal/alloy/polymer powders or, the deposition of layers of polymers
   through a heated extrusion head at a controlled rate. The thermal nature
   of these processes causes the development of temperature gradients
   throughout the part and as a result, the part undergoes irregular
   deformations which ultimately leads to dimensional inaccuracies in the
   manufactured part. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based methodology
   is presented in this paper to directly compensate the part geometric
   design which will help to counter the thermal deformations in the
   manufactured part. A feed forward ANN model is trained using
   backpropagation algorithm to study part deformations resulting from the
   AM process. The trained network is subsequently employed on the part
   Stereolithography (STL) file to effect the required geometrical
   corrections. Two examples are presented to evaluate the performance of
   the proposed compensation methodology. A novel approach to evaluate the
   conformity of the final part profile to the original part CAD profile
   has also been developed to quantify the performance of the proposed
   methodology. The results of the examples show substantial improvement in
   the part accuracy and thus validate the ANN based geometric compensation
   approach.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing technologies are known for fast prototyping and

   building process is presented by using filament feedstock for Fused
   Deposition Modeling process and part of the produced cores have been
   magnetically characterized. A second innovative printing process using a
   pellet-based material is investigated for the printing part. In order to
   consider soft magnetic ferrite, the modeling of the printed object has
   been carried out. First to calculate the losses in a toroidal inductor
   and take into account the strong impact of the temperature on the
   magnetic permeability. Second, to investigate the evolution of magnetic
   permeability in link with the material density. Thereafter an undulated
   geometry of a toroidal inductor that is enabled by 3d printing is
   presented as an illustration. Experimental characterization of the
   magnetic properties has been carried out to verify the modeling results

Abstract = {The present study demonstrates for the first time a unique UK-designed
   and built Additive Manufacturing (AM) hybrid system that combines
   polymer based structural deposition with digital deposition of
   electrically conductive elements. This innovative manufacturing system
   is based on a mull-planar build approach to improve on many of the
   limitations associated with AM, such as poor surface finish, low
   geometric tolerance and poor robustness. Specifically, the approach
   involves a mull-planar Material Extrusion (ME) process in which
   separated build stations with up to 5 axes of motion replace traditional
   horizontally-sliced layer modelling. The construction of multi-material
   architectures also involved using multiple print systems in order to
   combine both ME and digital deposition of conductive material. To
   demonstrate multi-material 3D Printing (3DP) we used three
   thermoplastics to print specimens, on top of which a unique Ag
   nano-particulate ink was printed using a non-contact jetting process,
   during which drop characteristics such as shape, velocity, and volume
   were assessed using a bespoke drop watching system. Electrical analysis
   of printed conducive tracks on polymer surfaces was performed during
   mechanical testing (static tensile and flexural testing and dynamic
   fatigue testing) to assess robustness of the printed circuits. Both
   serpentine and straight line patterns were used in the testing of Ag
   particle loaded ink and they showed very similar resistance changes
   during mechanical exposure. Monitored resistance and stress changed as a
   function of strain exhibiting hysteresis with more prominent residual
   strain during stretching and compression cycles and 3-point bending
   flexural tests of PA and CoPA substrates. Bare and encapsulated tracks
   exhibited low electrical resistivity (1-3{*}10(-6) Omega{*}m), and its
   change was more rapid on ABS and minor on PA and CoPA when increasing
   tensile and flexural strain up to 1.2\% and 0.8\%, respectively.
   Resistance of Ag tracks on ABS also increased rapidly during fatigue
   testing and the tracks easily fractured during repeated
   stretching-compression cycles at 1\% and 1.2\% strain. No resistance
   changes of Ag tracks printed on PA and CoPA were observed at lower
   strain amplitudes whereas at higher strain amplitudes these changes were
   the lowest for conducive tracks on CoPA. Thermal analyses were conducted
   to determine the printed material's glass transition temperature (Tg),
   stability and degradation behavior to find the optimum annealing
   conditions post printing. The novel AM printer has the ability to
   fabricate fully functional objects in one build, including integrated
   printed circuitry and embedded electronics. It enables product designers
   and manufactures to produce functional saleable electronic products.
   This new technology also gives the opportunity for designers to improve
   existing products, as well as create new products with the added
   advantages of geometrically unconstrained 3DP.},

Abstract = {Fabrication of dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) using additive
   manufacturing techniques can provide an alternative solution for current
   manufacturing processes of DEAs that are generally inconsistent and time
   consuming. In addition, additive manufacturing can allow DEAs with
   complex geometric configurations to be realized. This study investigates
   analytical approaches to optimize the performance of helical dielectric
   elastomer actuator (HDEA) based on additive manufacturing technologies.
   Optimized geometric configurations tailored to additive manufacturing
   and proper material selection for elastomer and electrode can improve
   the overall performance of HDEA. Due to the absence of pre-stretch in
   the elastomer membranes with additive manufacturing, associated
   drawbacks, such as electromechanical instability, high external voltage
   requirement, and their alternate solutions are analyzed and discussed.
   The performance of HDEA are evaluated by displacement, block force, and
   weight-to-force ratio by varying multiple geometric parameters including
   membrane thickness, pitch angle, inner-to-outer electrode ratio, and
   actuation voltage. Since the selection of materials is as important as
   the geometric parameters of the actuator, printable elastomer and
   electrode materials with dielectric and mechanical properties for HDEA
   are evaluated. By optimizing geometric parameters and selecting
   appropriate materials based on its properties, appropriate manufacturing
   techniques are discussed to print both dielectric elastomer and
   electrode layers.},

Abstract = {In the emerging modern technology of additive manufacturing, the need
   for optimization can be found in literature in many places. Additive
   manufacturing (AM) is making an object layer by layer directly from
   digital data. Previous works of literature have classified additive
   manufacturing processes into seven types. However, there is a lack of
   comprehensive review describing the optimization challenges and
   opportunities in the material extrusion process (polymer technology) and
   also the need for FDM polymer materials application in impeller making.
   In this review paper, a specific optimization method called
   multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) from the mathematical programming
   technique used in additive manufacturing polymer technology (AMPT) is
   discussed. The other topics such as different types of optimization
   techniques, applications of different MCDM tools and their applications
   in different fields including AM, and the optimization challenges and
   opportunities in AMPT particularly impeller application are discussed.},

Abstract = {Interest in additive manufacturing (AM) of polymers has intensified
   significantly in recent years as various industrial and research sectors
   begin to recognize the benefits of the technology, which include easy
   customization, reduced material wastage and short turnaround times. As
   demand for AM parts start to shift from prototypes to end products,
   there is an increasing impetus to improve the performance of 3D printed
   polymers. In response, recent studies have begun to explore ways to
   reinforce polymer matrices through the incorporation and alignment of
   fillers during the additive manufacturing process. Here, a review of the
   recent advances in 3D printing techniques for polymer composites has
   been conducted and analyzed, specifically for their ability to control
   the alignment and arrangement of discontinuous fillers, as well as other
   benefits and disadvantages associated with their operations. Common
   analytical models that are currently used to relate the microstructures
   of these composites to the macroscopic mechanical properties of the 3D
   printed parts are presented and discussed. The functional properties and
   applications of these materials are also briefly summarized.},

Abstract = {This paper builds on a previously developed framework that integrates
   additive manufacturing, life-cycle analysis, and value creation
   (Feldmann \& Kirsch, 2019) by exploring conditions related to the
   life-cycle approach that would require alignment among suppliers,
   additive manufacturing firms, and customers. This extension creates a
   bridge to aid the implementation of taking a sustainability approach to
   additive manufacturing. In order to develop this extension, we
   distinguish between direct/indirect customers and internal/external
   customers and then create a matrix of incentives and cognitive frames
   that we believe will help companies interested in large-scale AM improve
   both the speed and the effectiveness of AM adoption. We provide an
   organizing framework that managers can use to create a supply chain that
   is aligned around closed-loop principles that will help speed adoption
   and move closer to sustainable goals that exist for AM technologies.
   These include reduced raw material use, reduced scrap and material
   overage, reduced rework, and lower transportation costs. The goal is to
   attain often-conflicting goals of lower long-term costs and decreased
   environmental footprint. Using our extension, we believe we can provide
   a useful framework to help managers implementing advanced manufacturing
   technologies to achieve lower costs and greater environmental
   sustainability by creating a common supply chain framework around
   customized, on-demand products. (C) 2019, IFAC (International Federation

Abstract = {The design of modern mechanical components often requires the use of
   low-density and high-strength parts. Additive manufacturing presents
   competence in obtaining format complexity internally (voids, ducts,
   channels) and externally (shape, holes). However, parts obtained by
   material extrusion additive manufacturing are highly anisotropic and
   relatively weak. This paper aims to present a new mechanical design
   technique that combines the high geometry flexibility of additive
   manufacturing with internal structuring reinforcement by high-strength
   materials, which enables optimized parts with reinforcement in the most
   mechanical stressed areas during service, through adopting structured
   internal geometry filled with reinforcement material. Dense test
   specimens and test specimens with internal structural canals filled with
   reinforcement material (epoxy resin and carbon fibers) were designed,
   fabricated and tested physically and virtually. The obtained results
   provide property values for 3D-printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
   (typical material of additive manufacturing) and for this polymer
   reinforced with various reinforcement material configurations (useful
   for mechanical design). The reinforcement decreased anisotropy and
   improved mechanical properties. Optimized parts filled with resin and
   long carbon fibers had maximum flexural resistance of 112 MPa, with a
   specific weight of 1.1 g/cm(3). This reinforcement provided parts with
   specific flexural strength similar to structural aluminum alloys,
   preserving the geometry and external dimension of the printed parts. The
   technique presented here shows the possibility of new conceptions in
   mechanical components design and strength optimization by internal
   reinforcement canals in parts. The technique is useful for mechanical
   design activity and allows for new product conceptions based on additive
   manufacturing.},

Title = {Morphology Control in a Dual-Cure System for Potential Applications in

Abstract = {The polymerisation, morphology and mechanical properties of a
   two-component in-situ reacting system consisting of a rubbery
   dimethacrylate and a rigid epoxy polymer were investigated. The
   methacrylate component of the mixture was photocured using UV light
   exposure and, in a second curing process, the mixture was thermally
   postcured. The polymers formed a partially miscible system with two
   glass transition temperature (T-g) peaks measured using dynamic
   mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). The composition and relative rate of
   reaction of the two orthogonal polymerisations influenced the extent of
   miscibility of the two polymer-rich phases and the samples were
   transparent, indicating that the two phases were finely dispersed. The
   addition of a glycidyl methacrylate compatibiliser further increased the
   miscibility of the two polymers. The utility of this polymer system for
   additive manufacturing was investigated and simulated through
   layer-by-layer processing of the mixture in two steps. Firstly, the
   methacrylate component was photocured to solidify the material into its
   final shape, whilst the second step of thermal curing was used to
   polymerise the epoxy component. With the use of a simulated photomask, a
   simple shape was formed using the two orthogonal polymerisation stages
   to produce a solid object. The mechanical properties of this two-phase
   system were superior to a control sample made only of the methacrylate
   component, indicating that some reinforcing due to polymerisation of the
   epoxy across the interfaces had occurred in the postcuring stage.},

Abstract = {The use of fiber reinforcement in large area additive manufactured
   components is of industrial interest due to the ability to enhance the
   structural properties of final processed parts. This work presents a
   methodology to predict the tensile, compressive, and flexural yield
   strength of single beads of a large-scale, 3D printed, short-fiber
   reinforced material. The methodology is built on the strength theory of
   Van Hattum and Bernardo, which combines the Tsai-Wu failure criteria
   with Advani and Tucker's orientation averaging technique, allowing fiber
   orientation flow model results to serve as direct input into strength
   predictions. Visual advantages of the methodology such as the ability to
   plot spatially varying strength constants and failure plots are
   demonstrated. In addition, an analysis of the methodology's sensitivity
   to various parameters is conducted.},

Title = {Post-processing Considerations for Biomedical 3D Printing of Polymers},
Booktitle = {POLYMER-BASED ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING: BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Pages = {219-241},
Abstract = {In the last 10 years, additive manufacturing has progressed from being
   not just a prototyping technology but a manufacturing technology within
   the medical manufacturing industry; it has turned many medical
   manufacturing sectors completely on their heads such as the dental and
   hearing aid device making industries. 3D printing can create models of
   high organic intricacy in a relatively short period of time. It has
   greatly added to the medical industry advancements in visualising and
   creating complex human or animal anatomies and can be used as an aid for
   surgical planning and preparation, physician and patient
   pre-operative/treatment education, medical procedure training and
   upskilling, medical devices, medical device development, and custom
   medical device manufacturing. Additive manufacturing (AM) is rapidly
   growing with advances in new material development, higher resolution,
   and faster speeds, making it a cost-effective alternative manufacturing
   solution for many medical applications. The objective of this chapter is
   to provide some guidelines and considerations of the many steps involved
   in the manufacturing of biomedical polymers and the main post-processing
   considerations for individual types of industrial polymer technologies.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), commonly referred to as 3D printing, is
   viewed as a method of rapid prototyping and an alternative to
   traditional manufacturing. Recently, there has been increasing interest
   on sustainability of AM approaches and the materials that can be used.
   Advances in both AM technologies and polymer chemistry present multiple
   pathways for AM to become more sustainable, such as raw material
   sourcing, green synthesis, and end-of-life processing. This review
   provides a brief overview of AM techniques for polymers, sustainable
   sourcing of polymers in AM, and the advances of degradable/recyclable
   polymers in AM. It also provides a perspective of the potential role of
   AM in economic and chemical circularity, as well as opportunities for
   digital manufacturing for the future. Biodegradable materials for
   medical or other biological applications are beyond the scope of this
   review.},

Title = {In-situ monitoring of polymer flow temperature and pressure in extrusion
   based additive manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},
Pages = {76-83},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We demonstrate a novel Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) nozzle design to
   enable measurements of in-situ conditions inside FFF nozzles, which is
   critical to ensuring that the polymer extrudate is flowing at
   appropriate temperature and flow rate during the part build process.
   Testing was performed with ABS filament using a modified Monoprice Maker
   Select 3D printer. In-situ measurements using the printer's default
   temperature control settings showed an 11 degrees C decrease in
   temperature and significant fluctuation in pressure during printing as
   well as fluctuations while idle of +/- 2 degrees C and +/- 14 kPa. These
   deviations were eliminated at lower flow rates with a properly
   calibrated proportional-integral-derivative (PID) system. At the highest
   tested flow rates, decreases in melt temperature as high as 6.5 degrees
   C were observed, even with a properly calibrated PID, providing critical
   insight into the significance of flow rate and PID calibration on actual
   polymer melt temperature inside the FFF nozzle. Pressure readings
   ranging from 140 to 6900 kPa were measured over a range of filament feed
   rates and corresponding extrusion flow rates. In-situ pressure
   measurements were higher than theoretical predictions using a power-law
   fluid model, suggesting that the assumptions used for theoretical
   calculations may not be completely capturing the dynamics in the FFF
   liquefier. Our nozzle prototype succeeded in measuring the internal
   conditions of FFF nozzles, thereby providing a number of important
   insights into the printing process which are vital for monitoring and
   improving FFF printed parts.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on the characterization of additive manufacturing
   technology based on composite filament fabrication (CFF). CFF utilizes a
   similar method of layer by layer printing as fused filament fabrication
   but is also capable of reinforcing parts with layers of various
   continuous fibers into a polymer matrix. Due to the orthotropic
   characteristics of additive manufacturing based on fused filament
   fabrication, 3D printed parts may present different mechanical behavior
   under different orientations of stress. Furthermore, technologies such
   as CFF allow a range of configurations to fabricate and reinforce the
   parts. In this study, mechanical characterization of polyamide 6 (PA6)
   reinforced with carbon fiber was conducted by design of experiment as a
   statistical method, to investigate the effect of reinforcement pattern,
   reinforcement distribution, print orientation and percentage of fiber on
   compressive and flexural mechanical properties. CFF technology 3D print
   stronger parts than conventional additive manufacturing technologies.
   Maximized compressive response was achieved with a 0.2444 Carbon Fiber
   volume ratio, concentric and equidistant reinforcement configuration,
   resulting in a compressive modulus of 2.102 GPa and a stress at
   proportional limit of 53.3 MPa. Maximized flexural response was achieved
   with 0.4893 Carbon Fiber volume ratio, concentric reinforcement and
   perpendicular to the applied force, resulting in a flexural modulus of
   14.17 GPa and a proportional limit of 231.1 MPa.},

Abstract = {The Additive Manufacturing (AM) industry has expanded steadily,
   occupying the market very quickly. New types of 3D printers have
   appeared and new types of polymeric and composite materials have been
   developed for these printers. Thus it passed very quickly from the stage
   in which the parts that were made by rapid prototyping (RP) only to be
   exposed (demonstration parts) to stage AM the parts are fully
   functional. Of course, the future of AM is still on the horizon, it is
   barely visible. The other technologies for forming the geometry of the
   part, ie subtractive manufacturing technology and formative
   manufacturing technology are still the basis of industrial production.
   Each technology has its own advantages and disadvantages and is chosen
   on a case-by-case basis, depending on the objectives pursued. In this
   paper, a study is made on the rapid prototyping of a single pump rotor
   part. The material of the piece is of polymer type, ABS. The piece was
   made in two variants: by additive manufacturing technology (PolyJet) and
   by subtractive manufacturing technology (milling). After processing,
   several parameters were followed, such as the functionality of the part,
   the surface quality, the mechanical tensile strength, the dimensional
   accuracy, and last but not least the manufacturing cost and the duration
   of the manufacturing cycle. The data thus obtained were processed with
   an artificial intelligence program for decision making.},

Title = {A Comparative Study between Polymer and Metal Additive Manufacturing
   Approaches in Investigating Stiffened Hexagonal Cells},
Journal = {MATERIALS},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Recent polymer and metal additive manufacturing technologies were proven
   capable of building complex structures with high accuracy. Although
   their final products differ significantly in terms of mechanical
   properties and building cost, many structural optimization studies were
   performed with either one without systematic justification. Therefore,
   this study investigated whether the Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS)
   and Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) methodologies can provide similar
   conclusions when performing geometrical manipulations for optimizing
   structural crashworthiness. Two identical sets of four shapes of
   stiffened hexagonal cells were built and crushed under quasi-static
   loading. The results were compared in terms of collapsing behavior,
   load-carrying performance, and energy-absorption capability. Although
   the observed failure modes were different since the base-materials
   differ, similar improvement trends in performance were observed between
   both fabrication approaches. Therefore, FDM was recommended as a
   fabrication method to optimize thin-walled cellular hexagonal parameters
   since it was 80\% more time-efficient and 53.6\% cheaper than the DMLS
   technique.},

Abstract = {Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC) are third generation solar cells used
   as an alternative to c-Si solar cells. DSSC are mostly flexible, easier
   to handle and are less susceptible to damage compared to c-Si solar
   cells. Additionally, DSSC is an excellent choice for indoor application
   as they perform better under diverse light condition. Most DSSCs are
   made of liquid medium sandwiched between two conductive polymer layers.
   However, DSSCs have significantly lower efficiencies compared to silicon
   solar cells. Also, use of liquid medium resulting in leaking of liquid,
   and occasional freezing during cold weather, and thermal expansion
   during hot weather conditions. DSSC can be manufactured in small
   quantities using relatively inexpensive solution-phase techniques such
   as roll-to-roll processing and screen printing technology. However,
   scaling-up the DSSC manufacturing from small-scale laboratory tests to
   sizeable industrial production requires better and efficient
   manufacturing processes. This research studies the feasibility of using
   additive manufacturing technique to fabricate electrodes of DSSC. The
   study aims to overcome the limitations of DSSCs including preventing
   leakage and providing more customized design. Experimental studies are
   performed to evaluate the effects of critical process parameters
   affecting the quality of electrodes for DSSC. Volume resistivity test is
   performed to evaluate the efficiency of the electrodes. In this study,
   the electrodes of DSSC are successfully fabricated using Fused
   Disposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing technique. The results of this
   study would enable additive manufacturing technology towards rapid
   commercialization of DSSC technology.},

Abstract = {3D printing is an additive manufacturing technique (AM) widely used in
   the aerospace, shipbuilding, automotive and civil construction sectors
   to obtain lightweight sandwich structures made with complex core shapes
   to achieve excellent multifunctional properties, such as flexural
   stiffness, and high energy-absorption capabilities. This study shows an
   experimental analysis of the mechanical behavior of three types of core,
   including (i) out-of-plane and (ii) in-plane hexagonal honeycomb, and
   (iii) S-shape corrugated core. The fused deposition modeling method
   (FDM) is applied in the manufacture of fully integrated sandwich
   structures using polylactic acid (PLA) biopolymer filaments. Tensile,
   flexural and Charpy impact tests are used for the experimental
   investigation. The failure modes of polymeric structures are analyzed.
   The out-of-plane -comb and S-shape corrugated panels achieve similar
   mechanical behavior, however, superior tensile modulus, tensile
   strength, flexural modulus, flexural strength and energy absorbed are
   obtained in comparison with in-plane -comb core panels. Sandwich panels
   fabricated by AM achieve acceptable mechanical properties for secondary
   structural applications, especially when lightness is required.},

Title = {Additive Re-Manufacturing of Mechanically Recycled End-of-Life Glass
   Fiber-Reinforced Polymers for Value-Added Circular Design},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2020},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Despite the large use of composites for industrial applications, their
   end-of-life management is still an open issue for manufacturing,
   especially in the wind energy sector. Additive manufacturing technology
   has been emerging as a solution, enhancing circular economy models, and
   using recycled composites for glass fiber-reinforced polymers is
   spreading as a new additive manufacturing trend. Nevertheless, their
   mechanical properties are still not comparable to pristine materials.
   The purpose of this paper is to examine the additive re-manufacturing of
   end-of-life glass fiber composites with mechanical performances that are
   comparable to virgin glass fiber-reinforced materials. Through a
   systematic characterization of the recyclate, requirements of the filler
   for the liquid deposition modeling process were identified. Printability
   and material surface quality of different formulations were analyzed
   using a low-cost modified 3D printer. Two hypothetical design concepts
   were also manufactured to validate the field of application.
   Furthermore, an understanding of the mechanical behavior was
   accomplished by means of tensile tests, and the results were compared
   with a benchmark formulation with virgin glass fibers. Mechanically
   recycled glass fibers show the capability to substitute pristine
   fillers, unlocking their use for new fields of application.},

Abstract = {Additive tooling (AT) utilizes the advantages of rapid tooling
   development while minimizing geometrical limitations of conventional
   tool manufacturing such as complex design of cooling channels. This
   investigation presents a comparative experimental analysis of
   long-fiber-reinforced thermoplastic parts (LFTs), which are produced
   through additively manufactured injection molding polymer tools. After
   giving a review on the state of the art of AT and LFTs, additive
   manufacturing (AM) plastic tools are compared to conventionally
   manufactured steel and aluminum tools toward their qualification for
   spare part and small series production as well as functional validation.
   The assessment of the polymer tools focuses on three quality criteria
   concerning the LFT parts: geometrical accuracy, mechanical properties,
   and fiber configuration. The analysis of the fiber configuration
   includes fiber length, fiber concentration, and fiber orientation. The
   results show that polymer tools are fully capable of manufacturing LFTs
   with a cycle number within hundreds before showing critical signs of
   deterioration or tool failure. The produced LFTs moldings provide
   sufficient quality in geometrical accuracy, mechanical properties, and
   fiber configuration. Further, specific anomalies of the fiber
   configuration can be detected for all tool types, which include the
   occurrence of characteristic zones dependent on the nominal fiber
   content and melt flow distance. Conclusions toward the improvement of
   additively manufactured polymer tool life cycles are drawn based on the
   detected deteriorations and failure modes.},

Abstract = {Bone is a complex connective tissue that serves as mechanical and
   structural support for the human body. Bones' fractures are common, and
   the healing process is physiologically complex and involves both
   mechanical and biological aspects. Tissue engineering of bone scaffolds
   holds great promise for the future treatment of bone injuries. However,
   conventional technologies to prepare bone scaffolds cannot provide the
   required properties of human bones. Over the past decade,
   three-dimensional (3D) printing or additive manufacturing technologies
   have enabled control over the creation of bone scaffolds with
   personalized geometries, appropriate materials, and tailored pores. This
   article aims to review recent advances in the fabrication of bone
   scaffolds for bone repair and regeneration. A detailed review of bone
   fracture repair and an in-depth discussion on conventional manufacturing
   and 3D printing techniques are introduced with an emphasis on novel
   studies concepts, potentials, and limitations.},

Abstract = {A discrete element model has been developed to simulate the packing
   process of fibre/polymer composite powder for powder bed fusion additive
   manufacturing. The geometric shapes of polymer powder particles and
   fibres are represented by multi-sphere particles and individual
   cylinders with round ends, respectively. The numerical model can help to
   understand the flow dynamics of composite powder particles and the
   formation mechanisms of voids in powder packing processes. The numerical
   model has been utilised to analyse the effects of packing parameters on
   the packing quality of the powder bed. The simulation results suggest
   that the increase of the powder layer thickness is beneficial for
   increasing the packing density and lowering the surface roughness of the
   powder bed. A high roller spreading velocity degrades the packing
   quality of the powder bed. A small number of fibres in the composite
   powder particles are in favour of the packing quality, while excessive
   fibres reduce the packing quality of the powder bed.},

Title = {Influences of zirconium tungstate additives on characteristics of
   polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) components fabricated via material
   extrusion additive manufacturing process},

Abstract = {Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), a thermoplastic material with excellent
   resilience and piezoelectric potential, is a natural candidate for use
   in filament-based additive manufacturing technologies. However, due to
   the high thermal expansion and low surface energy of homopolymer PVDF,
   fabrication of this polymer via extrusion deposition processes is
   challenging, often resulting in substantial stress accumulation and
   unwanted distortion in printed parts. To address these challenges, this
   work investigates the effects of adding microscale zirconium tungstate
   particulate to improve the printability of PVDF materials. Zirconium
   tungstate was specifically selected because for its demonstrated
   negative coefficient of thermal expansion over the range of standard
   filament extrusion deposition method processing temperatures. Composite
   filament specimens were characterized with respect to mechanical,
   thermal, and microstructural properties. Compared with pure homopolymer
   printed specimens, results show that the particulate additives
   effectively lowered the net coefficient of thermal expansion at the
   expense of yield strength and total elongation to failure, while the
   semi-crystalline structure showed a mild reduction in beta-phase
   formation associated with increasing particulate content.},

Abstract = {It is no secret that the laser was the driver for additive manufacturing
   (AM) of 3D objects since such objects were first demonstrated in the
   mid-1980s. A myriad of techniques utilizing the directed energy of
   lasers were invented. Lasers are used to selectively sinter or fuse
   incremental layers in powder-beds, melt streaming powder following a
   programmed path, and polymerize photopolymers in a liquid vat
   layer-by-layer. The laser is an energy source of choice for repair of
   damaged components, for manufacture of new or replacement parts, and for
   rapid prototyping of concept designs. Lasers enable microstructure
   gradients and heterogeneous structures designed to exhibit unique
   properties and behavior. Laser-based additive manufacturing has been
   successful in producing relatively simple near net-shape metallic parts
   saving material and cost, but requiring finish-machining and in repair
   and refurbishment of worn components. It has been routinely used to
   produce polymer parts. These capabilities have been widely recognized as
   evidenced by the explosion in interest in AM technology, nationally.
   These successes are, however, tempered by challenges facing
   practitioners such as process and part qualification and verification,
   which are needed to bring AM as a true manufacturing technology. The ONR
   manufacturing science program, in collaboration with other agencies,
   invested in basic R\&D in AM since its beginnings. It continues to
   invest, currently focusing on developing cyber-enabled manufacturing
   systems for AM. It is believed that such computation, communication and
   control approaches will help in validating AM and moving it to the
   factory floor along side CNC machines.},

Title = {Bottom-Up Design of Composite Supraparticles for Powder-Based Additive
   Manufacturing},
Journal = {SMALL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Number = {30},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing promises high flexibility and customized product
   design. Powder bed fusion processes use a laser to melt a polymer powder
   at predefined locations and iterate the scheme to build 3D objects. The
   design of flowable powders is a critical parameter for a successful
   fabrication process that currently limits the choice of available
   materials. Here, a bottom-up process is introduced to fabricate tailored
   polymer- and composite supraparticles for powder-based additive
   manufacturing processes by controlled aggregation of colloidal primary
   particles. These supraparticles exhibit a near-spherical shape and
   tailored composition, morphology, and surface roughness. These
   parameters can be precisely controlled by the mixing and size ratio of
   the primary particles. Polystyrene/silica composite particles are chosen
   as a model system to establish structure-property relations connecting
   shape, morphology, and surface roughness to the adhesion within the
   powder, which is accessed by tensile strength measurements. The adhesive
   properties are then connected to powder flowability and it is shown that
   the resulting powders allow the formation of dense powder films with
   uniform coverage. Finally, successful powder bed fusion is demonstrated
   by producing macroscopic single layer specimens with uniform
   distribution of nanoscale silica additives.},

Title = {Powder bed fusion metrology for additive manufacturing design guidance},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {239-251},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Design for additive manufacturing (DFAM) guidelines are important for
   helping designers avoid iterations and leverage the design freedoms
   afforded by additive manufacturing (AM). Comprehensive design guidelines
   should incorporate a variety of features of interest to designers, and
   given the wide variety of AM processes and their associated capabilities
   and limitations, those guidelines may need to be process- or even
   machine-specific. One way to generate detailed DFAM guidelines is to
   implement a metrology study focused on a strategically designed test
   part. This paper describes how quantitative design guidelines are
   compiled for a polymer selective laser sintering (SLS) process via a
   metrology study. As part of the metrology study, a test part is designed
   to focus specifically on geometric resolution and accuracy of the
   polymer SLS process. The test part is compact, allowing it to be easily
   inserted into existing SLS builds and therefore eliminating the need for
   dedicated metrology builds. To build a statistical foundation upon which
   design guidelines can be compiled, multiple copies of the test part are
   fabricated within existing commercial builds in a factorial study with
   materials, build orientations, and locations within the build chamber as
   control factors. Design guidelines are established by measuring and
   analyzing the as-built test parts. The guidelines are summarized in this
   paper and documented in a publicly accessible, online web tool.},

Title = {Development of an Additive Manufacturing System for the Deposition of
   Thermoplastics Impregnated with Carbon Fibers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING AND MATERIALS PROCESSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {3},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This work presents an innovative system that allows the oriented
   deposition of continuous fibers or long fibers, pre-impregnated or not,
   in a thermoplastic matrix. This system is used in an integrated way with
   the filamentary fusion additive manufacturing technology and allows a
   localized and oriented reinforcement of polymer components for advanced
   engineering applications at a low cost. To demonstrate the capabilities
   of the developed system, composite components of thermoplastic matrix
   (polyamide) reinforced with pre-impregnated long carbon fiber (carbon +
   polyamide), 1 K and 3 K, were processed and their tensile and flexural
   strength evaluated. It was demonstrated that the tensile strength value
   depends on the density of carbon fibers present in the composite, and
   that with the passage of 2 to 4 layers of fibers, an increase in
   breaking strength was obtained of about 366\% and 325\% for the 3 K and
   1 K yarns, respectively. The increase of the fiber yarn diameter leads
   to higher values of tensile strength of the composite. The obtained
   standard deviation reveals that the deposition process gives rise to
   components with anisotropic mechanical properties and the need to
   optimize the processing parameters, especially those that lead to an
   increase in adhesion between deposited layers.},

Abstract = {Wood and lignocellulosic-based material components are explored in this
   review as functional additives and reinforcements in composites for
   extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing. The
   motivation for using these sustainable alternatives in 3D printing
   includes enhancing material properties of the resulting printed parts,
   while providing a green alternative to carbon or glass filled polymer
   matrices, all at reduced material costs. Previous review articles on
   this topic have focused only on introducing the use of natural fillers
   with material extrusion AM and discussion of their subsequent material
   properties. This review not only discusses the present state of
   materials extrusion AM using natural filler-based composites but will
   also fill in the knowledge gap regarding state-of-the-art applications
   of these materials. Emphasis will also be placed on addressing the
   challenges associated with 3D printing using these materials, including
   use with large-scale manufacturing, while providing insight to overcome
   these issues in the future.},

Abstract = {Living materials, which are composites of living cells residing in a
   polymeric matrix, are designed to utilize the innate functionalities of
   the cells to address a broad range of applications such as fermentation
   and biosensing. Herein, we demonstrate the additive manufacturing of
   catalytically active living materials (AMCALM) for continuous
   fermentation. A multi-stimuli-responsive yeast-laden hydrogel ink, based
   on F127-dimethacrylate, was developed and printed using a direct-write
   3D printer. The reversible stimuli-responsive behaviors of the polymer
   hydrogel inks to temperature and pressure are critical, as they enabled
   the facile incorporation of yeast cells and subsequent fabrication of 3D
   lattice constructs. Subsequent photo-cross-linking of the printed
   polymer hydrogel afforded a robust elastic material. These yeast-laden
   living materials were metabolically active in the fermentation of
   glucose into ethanol for 2 weeks in a continuous batch process without
   significant reduction in efficiency (similar to 90\% yield of ethanol).
   This cell immobilization platform may potentially be applicable toward
   other genetically modified yeast strains to produce other high-value
   chemicals in a continuous biofermentation process.},

Abstract = {Reversible covalent chemistry provides access to robust materials with
   the ability to be degraded and reformed upon exposure to an appropriate
   stimulus. Photoresponsive units are attractive for this purpose, as the
   spatial and temporal application of light is easily controlled. Coumarin
   derivatives undergo a {[}2 + 2] cycloaddition upon exposure to long-wave
   UV irradiation (365 nm), and this process can be reversed using
   short-wave UV light (254 nm). Therefore, polymers cross-linked by
   coumarin groups are excellent candidates as reversible covalent gels. In
   this work, copolymerization of coumarin-containing monomers with the
   hydrophilic comonomer N,N-dimethylacrylamide yielded water-soluble,
   linear polymers that could be cured with long-wave UV light into
   free-standing hydrogels, even in the absence of a photoinitiator.
   Importantly, the gels were reverted back to soluble copolymers upon
   short-wave UV irradiation. This process could be cycled, allowing for
   recycling and remolding of the hydrogel into additional shapes. Further,
   this hydrogel can be imprinted with patterns through a mask-based,
   post-gelation photoetching method. Traditional limitations of this
   technique, such as the requirement for uniform etching in one direction,
   have been overcome by combining these materials with a soft-matter
   additive manufacturing methodology. In a representative application of
   this approach, we printed solid structures in which the interior
   coumarin-cross-linked gel is surrounded by a nondegradable gel. Upon
   exposure to short-wave UV irradiation, the coumarin-cross-linked gel was
   reverted to soluble prepolymers that were washed away to yield hollow
   hydrogel objects.},

Abstract = {Filament shredders and extruders greatly expand the additive
   manufacturing material selection. By using recycled filaments, waste and
   future costs can be efficiently cut while creating in-house,
   customizable, filaments. Testing mixed filaments is necessary to
   determine the physical and chemical benefits and costs of mixing
   filaments. This work aims to characterize mixtures of Polylactic Acid
   and Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene. Mixtures were characterized through
   tensile strength testing and differential scanning calorimetry of
   extruded filament samples. The tested mixed filaments were found to be
   comparable to purchased filaments, with drastic increases in elasticity
   and decreases in torsional strength and tensile strength. This study
   shows that while possible to produce mixed filaments, and in spite of
   their chemical similarities, mixtures are not comparable in physical
   strength to pure filaments.},

Journal = {MECHATRONICS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {56},
Pages = {188-197},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {There has been tremendous interest in the Additive Manufacturing (AM) of
   polymers, metals, and ceramics leading to a wealth of research and
   development of these processes. By contrast, there has been little
   attention paid to AM processes for glass. This paper presents a
   custom-made glass additive machine. A CO2 laser is used to generate a
   molten pool of glass into which glass filaments are fed. A motion system
   is used to trace a layer, after which the build platform is lowered to
   fabricate the next layer. Two of the unique issues that must be
   addressed in the AM of glass are 1) various mechanisms can cause the
   formation of bubbles that deteriorate part optical and mechanical
   properties and 2) significant processing forces can move the melt pool
   away from its desired location. In this paper a melt pool temperature
   controller is designed to regulate the melt pool temperature at a
   constant value and a path and trajectory generation algorithm is
   constructed to maintain a constant glass filament feed direction
   relative to the scan velocity. The experimental results demonstrate that
   the melt pool temperature controller is able to avoid bubble formation
   over a wide range of build speeds and that the path planned
   directional-control is able to maintain good dimensional accuracy
   throughout closed contours. The capabilities of the AM for glass machine
   are demonstrated on a thin-walled, multi-layer star pattern and a spring
   in which the material is printed in freespace without the need for
   support structures.},

Abstract = {Purpose - Company pressure for manufacturers is mounting from two
   angles: increasing pressure of global competition, and rapid
   advancements in technology such as additive manufacturing (AM) that are
   altering the way that goods are manufactured. The purpose of this paper
   is to explore the adoption process of AM within a manufacturing system
   and its business impact.
   Design/methodology/approach - Research was conducted to collect
   empirical data at two manufacturing case companies in the North West
   England. Both cases are located in areas of industrial recovery using AM
   engineering innovation for value creation.
   Findings - Early findings showed that the implementation of AM caused a
   shift in value propositions and the creation of additional value streams
   (VSs) for the case study companies. AM was shown to compliment and
   strengthen traditional manufacturing VSs rather than replacing them.
   Research limitations/implications - Limitations include the
   generalizability due to the number and location of case companies
   included in this research.
   Practical implications - It is worthwhile to explore the opportunities
   that AM brings with the existing customer base as it has the potential
   to add unexplored and untapped value. However, managers need to be
   mindful of the capability and resources required to put the VS into
   practice.
   Social implications - Both cases resulted in skill retainment and
   development due to the implementation of AM. Hence, the innovation
   contributed to regional economic recovery and business survival.
   Originality/value - This empirical research is one of the early field
   explorations focussing on the impact of AM on VS structures. Hence, this
   paper contributes to the area of technology enhanced manufacturing
   systems.},

Abstract = {When manufacturing parts using material extrusion additive manufacturing
   and anisotropic polymers, the mechanical properties of a manufactured
   component are strongly dependent on the print trajectory orientation. We
   conduct non-planar slicing and optimize the print trajectories to
   maximize the alignment between the material deposition direction and the
   stress flow induced by a predefined load case. The trajectory
   optimization framework considers manufacturability constraints in the
   form of uniform layer height and line spacing. We demonstrate the method
   by manufacturing a load bearing mechanical bracket using a 5-axis 3D
   printer and a liquid crystal polymer material. The failure strength and
   stiffness of the optimized bracket are improved by a factor of 44 and 6
   respectively when compared with conventional printing.},

Abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) has become commonplace to iterate concepts
   and realize products in dif-ferent industries. The maturation of AM has
   made it a viable alternative to Subtractive Manufacturing (SM)
   processes, nevertheless there remain several unexplored opportunities.
   One of these is profile plastic ex-trusion tooling, which is typically
   produced at low volumes, can be complex in geometry, and could benefit
   from AM's bottom-up process. Such manufacturing options raise the
   question of how one can evaluate whether AM should be considered as
   opposed to SM. The objective of this work is to establish a technology
   assessment method to evaluate which extrusion profile cases warrant
   consideration for AM. Results from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
   simulations of polymer flow through the flow channel are related to
   several applied parameters used by the extrusion industry. This provides
   a means to evaluate a tool's design virtually before implementing in
   production. The technology assessment is performed on a U-Channel case,
   which is a common open profile shape with several product variations in
   industry. Results from this work indicate that there is no advantage of
   pursuing AM over an SM informed design for the specific U-Channel case
   used in this study. In addition, streamlining features alone do not
   necessarily lead to clear improve-ments, highlighting the need for
   technology assessment tools and methods to evaluate whether AM or SM
   should be implemented. This work lays the foundation for evaluating
   which extrusion profile cases warrant consideration for an AM
   process.(c) 2023 CIRP.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing enables the realization of complex shaped parts.
   This also provides a high potential for optical components. Thus
   elements with virtually any geometry can be realized, which is often
   difficult with conventional fabrication methods.
   Depending on the material and thus the manufacturing method used, either
   transparent optics or reflective optics can be developed with the aid of
   additive manufacturing. Ultimately, the application or the specification
   decides on the approach. For example, transmissive 3D printed parts
   exhibit the disadvantage of a significant reduced transmission.
   Conversely, reflective 3d printed optics often requires a greater amount
   of rework in order to achieve a sufficient optical quality of the
   surface.
   Here, we discuss 3D printed metal optics (manufactured using a selective
   laser melting machine) and 3D printed polymer optics (realized either by
   stereolithography or by multijet modling). In addition to the basic
   properties, the post-processing of the 3D printed optics is regarded.
   This includes, for example, cleaning and polishing of the surface using
   lasers, a robot based fluidjet process for metallic and polymer optics.
   In the case of the polymer optics a dip-coating process was developed in
   order to improve the surface quality, which is presented as well.
   Our aim is to integrate the additive manufactured optics into optical
   systems. Therefore we present different examples in order to point out
   new possibilities and new solutions enabled by 3D printing of the parts.
   In this context, the development of 3D printed reflective and
   transmissive adaptive optics will be discussed as well.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Poly(lactide) (PLA) is one of the most investigated semicrystalline
   polymers for material extrusion (MEX) additive manufacturing (AM)
   techniques based on polymer melt processing. Research on its application
   for the development of customized devices tailored to specific
   anatomical parts of the human body can provide new personalized medicine
   strategies. This research activity was aimed at testing a new
   multifunctional AM system for the design and fabrication by MEX of
   anatomical and dog-bone-shaped PLA samples with different infill
   densities and deposition angles. In particular, a commercial PLA
   filament was employed to validate the computer-aided design (CAD) and
   manufacturing (CAM) process for the development of scaffold prototypes
   modeled on a human bone defect. Physical-chemical characterization of
   the obtained samples by H-1-NMR spectroscopy, size exclusion
   chromatography (SEC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC) demonstrated a small reduction of polymer
   molecular weight (-5\%) due to thermal processing, as well as that the
   commercial polymer employed was a semicrystalline poly(D,L-lactide).
   Mechanical characterization highlighted the possibility of tuning
   elastic modulus and strength, as well as the elongation at break up to a
   60\% value by varying infill parameters.},

Abstract = {This article describes slurry development for lithography-based additive
   manufacturing (AM) of cemented carbide components. Due to their superior
   material properties compared to steels, tungsten carbide?cobalt
   hardmetals are an exciting material for manufacturing tools. AM
   technologies' geometric freedom makes it possible to design more
   efficient tools compared to other manufacturing techniques. These
   technologies are known as resource-efficient and sustainable processes.
   The material that is not required for manufacturing is re-used for the
   production of additional components. The high energy input in laser
   powder bed-based AM processes leads to strong grain growth and brittle
   phases, so the achievable mechanical properties are significantly
   limited. Lithography-based additive manufacturing shows high potential
   due to the manufacturing of a polymer-bound green body and a subsequent
   heat treatment. Tungsten carbide?cobalt (88-12 wt\%) slurries were
   developed with a solid content of 40 vol\%, based on the resin's
   reactive components. Dispersants made it possible to increase the
   maximum processable volume fraction of solid particles. A thixotropic
   agent helped stabilize the slurry. Rheological investigations
   characterized these effects. The influence of the photoinitiator
   concentration and the volume fraction of tungsten carbide and cobalt
   particles on the curing depth was analyzed. Prepared slurries and
   manufactured multi-layered green bodies were evaluated for homogeneity
   using quantitative microstructure analysis.

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The increasing environmental awareness is driving towards novel
   sustainable high-performance materials applicable for future
   manufacturing technologies like additive manufacturing (AM). Cellulose
   is abundantly available renewable and sustainable raw material. This
   work focused on studying the properties of thermoplastic cellulose-based
   composites and their properties using injection molding and 3D printing
   of granules. The aim was to maximize the cellulose content in
   composites. Different compounds were prepared using cellulose acetate
   propionate (CAP) and commercial cellulose acetate propionate with
   plasticizer (CP) as polymer matrices, microcellulose (mc) and novel
   cellulose-ester additives; cellulose octanoate (C8) and cellulose
   palmitate (C16). The performance of compounds was compared to a
   commercial poly(lactic acid)-based cellulose fiber containing composite.
   As a result, CP-based compounds had tensile and Charpy impact strength
   properties comparable to commercial reference, but lower modulus.
   CP-compounds showed glass transition temperature (Tg) over 58\% and heat
   distortion temperature (HDT) 12\% higher compared to reference. CAP with
   C16 had HDT 82.1 degrees C. All the compounds were 3D printable using
   granular printing, but CAP compounds had challenges with printed layer
   adhesion. This study shows the potential to tailor thermoplastic
   cellulose-based composite materials, although more research is needed
   before obtaining all-cellulose 3D printable composite material with
   high-performance.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Drug-eluting films made of bioresorbable polymers are a widely used tool
   of modern personalized medicine. However, most currently existing
   methods of producing coatings do not go beyond the laboratory, as they
   have low encapsulation efficiency and/or difficulties in scaling up. The
   PLACE (Printed Layered Adjustable Cargo Encapsulation) technology
   proposed in this article uses an additive approach for film
   manufacturing. PLACE technology is accessible, scalable, and
   reproducible in any laboratory. As a demonstration of the technology
   capabilities, we fabricated layered drug-eluting polyglycolic acid films
   containing different concentrations of Cefazolin antibiotic. The
   influence of the amount of loaded drug component on the film production
   process and the release kinetics was studied. The specific loading of
   drugs was significantly increased to 200-400 mu g/cm(2) while
   maintaining the uniform release of Cefazolin antibiotic in a dosage
   sufficient for local antimicrobial therapy for 14 days. The fact that
   the further increase in the drug amount results in the crystallization
   of a substance, which can lead to specific defects in the cover film
   formation and accelerated one-week cargo release, was also shown, and
   options for further technology development were proposed.},

Abstract = {With the demand for complex, individualized and functionalized products
   with respect to constantly decreasing life cycles, additive
   manufacturing processes such as the process of selective laser sintering
   (SLS) has increasingly been of industrial interest. These processes are
   being used more and more to produce models, prototypes and partially
   finished products made of plastic, metal or ceramic and require neither
   a tool nor a form. Affected by decreasing installation spaces and
   increasing functional densities, flexible methods for circuit board
   application and their combination with additive manufacturing are in the
   focus of electronic industry research activities.
   In the context of this article both a thermoplastic polymer polybutylene
   terephthalate (PBT) which has been prepared to defined powder fractions
   with cryogenic milling, and the established and commercially available
   SLS material (PA12, PA2200) were the subject of a dry coating process
   with LDS-additives. Subsequently, these LDS-powders were processed with
   SLS to form test specimens. Finally their surface was structured and
   metallized through the LPKF-LDS-process (Laser-Direct-Structuring).
   Based on these metallized specimens, the metallization was studied as a
   function of an LDS-additive filling ratio. To uncover positive synergy
   effects from additively manufacturing the polymer body, the
   metallization was analyzed in terms of shape and adhesive strength.},

Abstract = {Automated fiber placement (AFP) is emerging as one of the advanced
   methods toward fabrication of polymer matrix based composite structures.
   This automated technique focuses on polymer composite manufacturing for
   use in a wide range of automotive and aerospace applications. The AFP
   process offers an elevated level of customization through the
   possibility of placing each individual tow at custom-designed
   trajectories. Additive manufacturing (AM) method, on the other hand, has
   the potential to fabricate functional end user parts of complex
   geometries, thus eliminating the need for costly tooling, multi-step
   processing and fasteners or joints. This paper will highlight the
   potential of fusing AFP and AM processes to fabricate complex 3D polymer
   based composite parts. A combination of these two processes suggests a
   promising option for composite materials development, improving
   composite structures in terms of complexity and customizability. The
   paper presents the adopted research methodology, background research,
   the design, development and set up of an experimental workcell that
   fuses AM and AFP, and the design methodology which is required to design
   complex composite parts using the proposed manufacturing process. Main
   challenges and opportunities are discussed, such as how restrictions of
   conventional composite production can be eased, and additional freedoms
   of design can be achieved.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a new additive manufacturing method based on
   electric poling process often used in many polymeric materials
   processing for lead-free piezoelectric device fabrication. This is to
   directly and continuously print piezoelectric devices from
   Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymeric filament rods under a strong
   electric field and mechanical stretching along the filament core.
   Piezoelectric devices were fabricated and its crystalline phase
   transition was measured by using the Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscope. The results demonstrate that increasing the electric field
   increases the piezoelectric crystalline phase transitions and results in
   a device with higher current output under stress. This technique can be
   used to fabricate fully 3D freeform structured piezoelectric devices for
   sensing, actuator and energy harvesting applications with a simple, low
   cost, integrated processing and fabrication step.},

Abstract = {The development of chemistry is reported to implement selective
   dual-wavelength olefin metathesis polymerization for continuous additive
   manufacturing (AM). A resin formulation based on dicyclopentadiene is
   produced using a latent olefin metathesis catalyst, various
   photosensitizers (PSs) and photobase generators (PBGs) to achieve
   efficient initiation at one wavelength (e.g., blue light) and fast
   catalyst decomposition and polymerization deactivation at a second
   (e.g., UV-light). This process enables 2D stereolithographic (SLA)
   printing, either using photomasks or patterned, collimated light.
   Importantly, the same process is readily adapted for 3D continuous AM,
   with printing rates of 36 mm h(-1) for patterned light and up to 180 mm
   h(-1) using un-patterned, high intensity light.},

Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},

Abstract = {The application of additive manufacturing (AM) in construction has been
   increasingly studied in recent years. Large robotic arm- and
   gantry-systems have been created to print building parts using
   aggregate-based materials, metals, or polymers. Significant benefits of
   AM are the automation of the production process, a high degree of design
   freedom, and the resulting potential for optimization. However, the
   building components and 3D-printing processes need to be modeled
   appropriately. In this paper, the current state of AM in construction is
   reviewed. AM processes and systems as well as their application in
   research and construction projects are presented. Moreover, digital
   methods for planning 3D-printed building parts and AM processes are
   described.},

Title = {Geometric imperfections of additive manufactured members},
Journal = {ENGINEERING STRUCTURES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {252},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Challenges in civil engineering and construction industries increase,
   and simultaneously it is necessary to provide a sustainable utilization
   of resources. Optimising material applications and manufacturing
   processes is therefore essential for modern constructions. Highly
   optimised structural components are already in use in lightweight
   constructions as well as in aircraft and vehicle industries. In the
   course of digitisation, new possibilities have evolved in recent years
   for producing individual and optimized solutions with regard to the
   consumption of materials, especially in construction industries. Methods
   of generative or additive manufacturing are employed to develop various
   prototypes of structural components. In this context,
   Wire-Arc-Additive-Manufacturing (WAAM) is a promising method for steel
   structures. However, it remains to be investigated to what extent
   dimensional accuracy, surface finish, weld quality and repeated thermal
   influences from the build-up process affect the structural behaviour of
   corresponding members. This paper deals with the geometric imperfections
   of corresponding additively manufactured profiles and exemplifies their
   influence on the bearing capacity.},

Abstract = {Binder jetting is an additive manufacturing process utilizing a
   liquid-based binding agent to selectively join the material in a powder
   bed. It is capable of manufacturing complex-shaped parts from a variety
   of materials including metals, ceramics, and polymers. This paper
   provides a comprehensive review on currently available reports on metal
   binder jetting from both academia and industry. Critical factors and
   their effects in metal binder jetting are reviewed and divided into two
   categories, namely material-related factors and process-related
   parameters. The reported data on density, dimensional and geometric
   accuracy, and mechanical properties achieved by metal binder jetting are
   summarized. With parameter optimization and a suitable sintering
   process, ten materials have been proven to achieve a relative density of
   higher than 90\%. Indepth discussion is provided regarding densification
   as a function of various attributes of powder packing, printing, and
   post-processing. A few grades of stainless steel obtained equivalent or
   superior mechanical properties compared to cold working. Although binder
   jetting has gained its popularity in the past several years, it has not
   been sufficiently studied compared with other metal additive
   manufacturing (AM) processes such as powder bed fusion and directed
   energy deposition. Some aspects that need further research include the
   understanding of powder spreading process, binder-powder interaction,
   and part shrinkage.},

Abstract = {Adoption of additive manufacturing for producing end-use products faces
   a range of limitations. For instance, quality of AM-fabricated parts
   varies from run to run and from machine to machine. There is also a lack
   of standards developed for AM processes. Another limitation is
   inconsistent dimensional accuracy error, which is often out of the
   standard tolerancing range. To tackle these challenges, this work aims
   at predicting scaling ratio for each part separately depending on its
   placement, orientation and CAD characteristics. Recent attention to
   machine learning techniques as a tool for data analysis in additive
   manufacturing shows that such methods as classical artificial neural
   networks (ANN), such as multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and convolutional
   neural networks (CNN) have a great potential. For the data collected on
   polymer powder bed fusion system (EOS P395), MLP outperformed CNN based
   on accuracy of prediction and mean squared error. The predicted scaling
   ratio can be used to adjust size of the parts before fabrication.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, has become widely used in recent
   years for the creation of both prototype and end-use parts. Because the
   parts are created in a layer-by-layer manner, the flexibility of
   additive manufacturing is unparalleled and has opened the design space
   to enable features like undercuts and internal channels which cannot
   exist on traditional, subtractively manufactured parts. This flexibility
   can also be leveraged for optical applications. This paper outlines some
   of the current uses of 3D printing in the optical manufacturing process
   at Optimax. Several materials and additive technologies are utilized,
   including polymer printing through fused deposition modeling, which
   creates parts by depositing a softened thermoplastic filament in a
   layerwise fashion. Stereolithography, which uses light to cure layers of
   a photopolymer resin, will also be discussed. These technologies are
   used to manufacture functional prototypes, fixtures, sealed housings,
   and other components. Additionally, metal printing through selective
   laser melting, which uses a laser to melt metal powder layers into a
   dense solid, will be discussed due to the potential to manufacture
   thermally stable optical-mechanical assembly frameworks and functional
   optics. Examples of several additively manufactured optical components
   will be shown.},

Abstract = {Frontal polymerization (FP) is a process in which the heat generated by
   the self-reaction transforms monomers to cured polymers. Here, in order
   to improve the flexibility of polydicyclopentadiene, comonomers
   (norbornene-terminated polyether, ND-230,400,2000) are designed and
   synthesized, which can copolymerize with dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) by FP.
   The polymers (ND) prepared by ND-2000 and DCPD have tunable mechanical
   properties, from thermosets to elastomers. Specifically, the breaking
   elongation of the polymers can be varied 69-fold, from 6.1\% to 423.4\%
   by controlling the proportion of ND-2000. Among them, ND polymer with 50
   wt\% ND-2000 has good elastic behavior without yield. And, the reaction
   mixture solutions of DCPD and ND-2000 have the characteristics of
   controllable gel time and shear thinning, which make it have the
   potential of application in additive manufacturing.},

Abstract = {The preparation of polypropylene (PP)/microcrystalline cellulose (MCC)
   composites and their applicability for material extrusion additive
   manufacturing (ME-AM) is reported. MCC is modified by grafting onto its
   surface with different silanes, in particular
   perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane, n-octyltriethoxysilane (OTS), or
   aminopropyltriethoxysilane. The efficacy of the surface modification is
   confirmed by attenuated total reflectance and X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy. The affinity of the modified MCC to the polar PP matrix is
   investigated by direct melt-compounding, and the applicability of the
   resulting composites for material ME-AM is accessed by fabrication of
   filaments and evaluating the relevant property requirements. The surface
   modification of the MCC improves their dispersibility in PP and enhances
   the mechanical properties of the composites. Moreover, the OTS-modified
   MCC shows the best reinforcement, good surface finish of the filament,
   and flawless printability.},

Title = {Deep learning-assisted real-time defect detection and closed-loop
   adjustment for additive manufacturing of continuous fiber-reinforced
   polymer composites},
Journal = {ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {79},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Real-time defect detection and closed-loop adjustment of additive
   manufacturing (AM) are essential to ensure the quality of as-fabricated
   products, especially for carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP)
   composites via AM. Machine learning is typically limited to the
   application of online monitoring of AM systems due to a lack of accurate
   and accessible databases. In this work, a system is developed for
   real-time identification of defective regions, and closed-loop
   adjustment of process parameters for robot-based CFRP AM is validated.
   The main novelty is the development of a deep learning model for defect
   detection, classification, and evaluation in realtime with high
   accuracy. The proposed method is able to identify two types of CFRP
   defects (i.e., misalignment and abrasion). The combined deep learning
   with geometric analysis of the level of misalignment is applied to
   quantify the severity of individual defects. A deep learning approach is
   successfully developed for the online detection of defects, and the
   defects are effectively controlled by closed-loop adjustment of process
   parameters, which is never achievable in any conventional methods of
   composite fabrication.},

Title = {Technical pathways for distributed recycling of polymer composites for
   distributed manufacturing: Windshield wiper blades},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {157},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Centralized waste plastic recycling is economically challenging, yet
   distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM) provides
   consumers with direct economic incentives to recycle. This study
   explores the technical pathways for DRAM of complex polymer composites
   using a case study of windshield wiper blades. These blades are a
   thermoplastic composite made up of a soft (flexible) and hard (less
   flexible) material. The distributed manufacturing methods included
   mechanical grinding to fused granular fabrication, heated syringe
   printing, 3-D printed molds coupled to injection molding and filament
   production in a recyclebot to fused filament fabrication. The particle
   size, angle of repose, thermal and rheological properties are
   characterized for the two sub-materials to define the conditions for the
   extrusion. A successful pathway for fabricating new products was found
   and the mechanical properties of the resultant components were
   quantified. Finally, the means to convert scrap windshield wiper blades
   into useful, high-value, bespoke biomedical products of fingertip grips
   for hand prosthetics was demonstrated. This study showed that the DRAM
   model of materials recycling can be used to improve the variety of
   solutions for a circular economy.},

Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Pages = {536-543},

Abstract = {Millions of Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) are consumed annually by soldiers
   around the world. This results in the generation of thousands of tons of
   residual polymeric packaging waste, which is either left behind in the
   environment or otherwise recycled or incinerated at a cost of several
   millions of U.S. dollars per year. Advancements in distributed recycling
   technologies now allow for on-demand reconstitution of traditionally
   neglected MRE pouch waste into useful appliances via material extrusion
   additive manufacturing. In this work, we demonstrate recycling of MRE
   pouch materials through a combined compounding, filament extrusion, and
   fused filament fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing protocol.
   Mechanical properties and barrier properties of additively manufactured
   structures were evaluated through tensile testing and water vapor
   transmission testing, respectively, and found to be comparable to the
   native pouch materials. Differential Scanning Calorimetry and
   Thermogravimetric Analysis of the extruded filament and printed
   materials were contrasted with native pouch materials, showing minimal
   effects of the manufacturing process on critical thermal transitions in
   the polymer. Economics and viability of on-demand reconstitution using
   these proposed methods are briefly discussed and reveal the multiple
   benefits of this recycling process.},

Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},

Abstract = {Extrusion-based additive manufacturing was used to prepare
   polyurethane/polylactide (TPU/PLA) samples. The PLA phase was deformed
   into a microfiber structure because of the strong shear effect of
   extrusion-based additive manufacturing. This novel microfiber could not
   only reinforce considerably the matrix but was also beneficial to the
   shape memory property. When stretched at an appropriate temperature, the
   samples could maintain their deformation after cooling and recover
   automatically after thermal stimulation. Thus, a high-efficiency method
   to create 4D-printed samples by extrusion-based additive manufacturing
   is proposed. The effects of phase morphology and molecule structure on
   the shape memory cycle are also discussed.},

Title = {The influence of printing parameters on multi-material two-photon
   polymerisation based micro additive manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Two-photon polymerisation (2PP) based additive manufacturing has emerged
   as a powerful technology to fabricate complex three-dimensional micro-
   and nanoscale architectures. However, a comprehensive understanding of
   the effect of printing parameters on the functional properties of these
   structures is needed to unleash the potential of 2PP and enable
   controlled deposition / integration of various materials into
   multi-material structures. In this study we investigate the correlation
   between printing parameters, resin composition and the final properties
   of 2PP structures fabricated with different monomers and initiators. The
   link between 2PP process and final material properties is validated by
   morphological studies, vibrational spectroscopy and advanced mass
   spectrometry, ToF-SIMS, imaging. We establish empirical relationships
   between printing parameters and mechanical properties, and achieve
   controlled deposition of different monomers with high precision and
   uniform composition. The approaches developed here are successfully used
   to demonstrate multi-material 2PP and produce complex 3D architectures
   incorporating three polymers. The 2PP structures produced can be
   transferred into solution or onto different substrates, in addition to
   direct fabrication on flexible substrates. This work advances the
   understanding of the 2PP process, which enable rational design and
   manufacture of complex geometries and additive manufacturing of
   nanoscale multi-material structures.},

   Additive Manufactured Epoxy Lattices},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {3},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this paper, a new process of joining additive manufactured (AM)
   lattice structures and carbon fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRPs) to
   manufacture hybrid lattice sandwich structures without secondary bonding
   is investigated. Multiple variations of lattice structures are designed
   and 3D printed using Digital Light Synthesis (DLS) and a two-stage
   (B-stage) epoxy resin system. The resulting lattice structures are only
   partially cured and subsequently thermally co-cured with pre-impregnated
   carbon fiber reinforcement. The mechanical properties of the additive
   manufactured lattice structures are characterized by compressive tests.
   Furthermore, the mechanical properties of hybrid lattice sandwich
   structures are assessed by flexural beam testing. From compressive
   testing of the additive manufactured lattice structures, high specific
   strength can be ascertained. The mechanical behavior shows these lattice
   structures to be suitable for use as sandwich core materials. Flexural
   beam testing of hybrid lattice sandwich structures shows high strength
   and stiffness. Furthermore, the strength of the co-cured bond interface
   is high enough to surpass the strength of the lattice core.},

Title = {Use of Wood in Additive Manufacturing: Review and Future Prospects},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Polymers filled with natural-based fillers have shown growing
   demand/interest in recent years, including in additive manufacturing.
   Like most natural fillers in 3D printing, wood particles serve mainly as
   a filler that lowers the cost of the printing material due to their low
   price. However, could wood be used as a main ingredient to
   affect/improve the properties of 3D-printed parts? Several advantages,
   such as its reinforcing ability, biodegradability, availability as waste
   material from other industries, ability to be used in different forms or
   only in partial components, recycling options or even the use of its
   undesirable hydromorph-induced dimensional instability for 4D printing,
   indicate the importance of exploring its use in 3D printing. A review of
   publications on 3D printing with wood biomass and technologies involving
   the use of wood particles and components was conducted to identify the
   possibilities of using wood in additive technologies and their
   potential.},

Journal = {MATERIALS TODAY ADVANCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Electrically conductive polymer composites have sparked considerable
   interest in the research com-munity due to their unique advantages that
   come from combining regular polymers with the electronic properties of
   metals or semiconductors in a synergistic manner. Additive manufacturing
   (AM) offers promising prospects in the realm of conductive polymer
   composites by allowing for greater design flexibility, more complicated
   shapes, and rapid manufacturing. In addition, a rising number of
   additive manufacturing (AM) methods, including material extrusion, vat
   photopolymerization, material and binder jetting, powder bed fusion, and
   sheet lamination are now available for the 3D printing of conductive
   polymer composites. In this article, we present an insight into current
   research advances in the field of conductive polymer composites
   developed for additive manufacturing, which accelerate the design and
   development of 3D printable electrical devices. We examine various AM
   processes in terms of their respective limitations, address the material
   requirements and significant breakthroughs in 3D printing of conductive
   polymer composites, and discuss promising electronic applications -such
   as flexible electronics, energy storage and conversion devices, etc.
   This overview concludes with an assessment of potential future
   directions and themes in this developing area.(c) 2022 Published by

Abstract = {In common thermoplastic additive manufacturing (AM) processes, a solid
   polymer filament is melted, extruded though a rastering nozzle, welded
   onto neighboring layers and solidified. The temperature of the polymer
   at each of these stages is the key parameter governing these
   non-equilibrium processes, but due to its strong spatial and temporal
   variations, it is difficult to measure accurately. Here we utilize
   infrared (IR) imaging - in conjunction with necessary reflection
   corrections and calibration procedures - to measure these temperature
   profiles of a model polymer during 3D printing. From the temperature
   profiles of the printed layer (road) and sublayers, the temporal profile
   of the crucially important weld temperatures can be obtained. Under
   typical printing conditions, the weld temperature decreases at a rate of
   approximately 100 degrees C/s and remains above the glass transition
   temperature for approximately 1 s. These measurement methods are a first
   step in the development of strategies to control and model the printing
   processes and in the ability to develop models that correlate critical
   part strength with material and processing parameters. Published by

   Composites: A Review},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a sustainable and innovative
   manufacturing technology to fabricate products with specific properties
   and complex shapes for additive manufacturable materials including
   polymers, steels, titanium, copper, ceramics, composites, etc. This
   technology can well facilitate consumer needs on products with complex
   geometry and shape, high strength and lightweight. It is sustainable
   with having a layer-by-layer manufacturing process contrary to the
   traditional material removal technology-subtractive manufacturing.
   However, there are still challenges on the AM technologies, which
   created barriers for their further applications in engineering fields.
   For example, materials properties including mechanical, electrical, and
   thermal properties of the additively manufactured products are greatly
   affected by using different ways of AM methods and it was found as the
   material anisotropy phenomenon. In this study, a detailed literature
   review is conducted to investigate research work conducted on the
   material anisotropy phenomenon of additively manufactured materials.
   Based on research findings on material anisotropy phenomenon reported in
   the literature, this review paper aims to understand the nature of this
   phenomenon, address main factors and parameters influencing its severity
   on thermal, electrical and mechanical properties of 3D printed parts,
   and also, explore potential methods to minimise or mitigate this
   unwanted anisotropy. The outcomes of this study would be able to shed a
   light on improving additive manufacturing technologies and material
   properties of additively manufactured materials.},

Title = {Consolidation of Additive Manufactured Continuous Carbon Fiber
   Reinforced Polyamide 12 Composites and the Development of
   Process-Related Numerical Simulation Methods},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing of high-performance polymers-such as PA12, PPS,
   PEEK, and PEKK-combined with industrial-grade carbon fibers with a high
   fiber volume ratio of up to 60\% allows a weight reduction of over 40\%
   compared to classic metal construction. Typically, these 3D-printed
   composites have a porosity of 10-30\% depending on the material and the
   printing process parameters, which significantly reduces the quality of
   the part. Therefore, the additive manufacturing of load-bearing
   structural applications requires a proper consolidation after the
   printing process-the so-called `additive fusion technology'-allowing
   close to zero void content in the consolidated part. By means of the
   upfront digital modeling of the consolidation process, a highly
   optimized composite component can be produced while decreasing the
   number of expensive prototyping iterations. In this study, advanced
   numerical methods are presented to describe the consolidation process of
   additive manufactured continuous carbon fiber reinforced composite parts
   based on the polyamide 12 (PA12) matrix. The simulation of the additive
   fusion step/consolidation provides immediate accuracy in determining the
   final degree of crystallization, process-induced deformation and
   residual stresses, final engineering constants, as well as porosity. The
   developed simulation workflow is demonstrated and validated with
   experimental data from consolidation tests on the final porosity,

   into varying geometries upon the application of external stimuli. The
   work here explores the raster pattern sensitivity of the shape memory
   properties of two iterations of a polymer blend system composed of
   thermoplastic rubber and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. Tensile test
   specimens were fabricated in three different raster patterns through the
   use of material extrusion additive manufacturing and deformed at room
   (25 degrees C), low (-40 degrees C) and high temperatures (105 and 110
   degrees C). Shape memory parameters were assessed and the shape fixation
   ratio was found to exhibit a sensitivity to raster pattern when
   deformation occurred at room and low temperatures, while the shape
   recovery ratio was found to be sensitive to raster pattern when
   deformation occurred at elevated temperatures. The influence of phase
   content was also explored and a decrease in rubber content led to an
   improvement in shape memory properties. The alignment of polymer phases
   with print raster direction was also found to influence raster pattern
   sensitivity.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS},

Volume = {104},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The application of material extrusion-based additive manufacturing
   methods has recently become increasingly popular in the medical sector.
   Thereby, thermoplastic materials are likely to be used. However,
   thermoplastics are highly dependent on the temperature and loading rate
   in comparison to other material classes. Therefore, it is crucial to
   characterise these influences on the mechanical properties. On this
   account, dynamic mechanical analyses to investigate the application
   temperature range, and tensile tests at different crosshead speeds
   (10(3), 10(1), 10(-1) and 10(-3) mms(-1)) were performed on various
   3D-printable polymers, namely polyetheretherketone (PEEK), polylactide
   (PLA), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), glycol-modified poly(ethylene
   terephthalate) (PETG), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and
   polypropylene (PP). It was found that the mechanical properties of PEEK,
   PLA, PMMA and PETG hardly depend on temperature changes inside the human
   body. PVDF and PP show a significant decrease in stiffness with
   increasing body temperatures. Additionally, the dependency of the
   stiffness on the strain-rate is increasing between PLA, PP, PEEK, PETG,
   PMMA and PVDF. Besides the mechanical integrity of these materials
   (strength, stiffness and its strain-rate and temperature dependency
   inside the body), the materials were further ranked considering their
   filling density as a measure of their processability. Hence, useful
   information for the selection of possible medical applications for each
   material and the design process of 3D-printed implants are provided.},

Title = {Importance of Polymer Rheology on Material Extrusion Additive
   Manufacturing: Correlating Process Physics to Print Properties},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1218-1249},

Abstract = {Recent advances in the field of additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D
   printing, have garnered serious interest for its potential to substitute
   time-consuming and costly subtractive and formative manufacturing
   techniques. Material extrusion (MatEx), employing filament and
   pelletbased feedstocks, is an AM technique for fabricating
   three-dimensional objects dictated by a computer-aided design (CAD) file
   in a layer-by-layer manner. Being inherently a ``melt-and-form{''}
   technique, the physics of MatEx is strongly dependent on the melt flow
   behavior of the polymers and hence on their rheology. The focus of this
   review article is to analyze the current progress in rheological
   characterizations of filament and pellet-based polymeric feedstocks for
   application in MatEx. The importance of shear and temperature-dependent
   viscosities in relation to consistent extrusion through the print nozzle
   and in the standoff region between nozzle and bed will be highlighted.
   The importance of shear and/or extensional viscosities and extent of die
   swell (upon exit from the nozzle) experienced by the polymers under
   processing parameters relevant to MatEx will be investigated.
   Postextrusion from the nozzle, the rheological characteristics of the
   viscous polymer melt as it cools once deposited on the print bed governs
   the degree of interlayer welding, that impacts the mechanical
   performance of the printed parts. Controlling and monitoring rheological
   properties such as zero-shear viscosities and shear moduli of the melt
   is of significant importance in this region in order to ensure proper
   mechanical robustness and shape integrity of the deposited layers. Both
   experimental and theoretical approaches based on polymer chain reptation
   mechanisms will be reviewed in detail and suggestions to address the
   existing limitations associated with the process will be provided.
   Fundamental understanding of the correlation between the classical
   theories and current understanding based on recent experimentation and
   analysis is expected to assist the design and development of the next
   generation of polymer feedstocks and machine designs for MatEx-based AM.},

Abstract = {Healing of bone fractures highly depends on the biocompatibility,
   stability in biological conditions, biodegradability, technical
   functionality, and shelf-life of biomaterials. Metallic biomaterials
   offer excellent mechanical properties and biocompatibility. However,
   metallic bone implants result in stress shielding, release of toxic
   ions, excessive wear, and corrosion. Polymer materials are being
   explored for bone implants due to their light-weight, biocompatibility,
   biodegradability, and absence of stress shielding. In the new era,
   additive manufacturing (AM) is being preferred due to its capability of
   fabricating customer specific implants with minimum material wastage.
   However, AM based polymer implants lack in mechanical strength and
   biological properties. Surface modification of polymeric substrates
   using coatings and incorporation of bioadditives have been regarded as
   alternatives for improvement of mechanical and biological properties.
   This review discusses about various coating techniques and gives an
   overview about coatings and bioadditives that can be used for
   enhancement of properties. From the review, it is evident that
   reinforcement of hydroxyapatite to polylactic acid resulted in
   prevention of crack growth during shape recovery cycles which can be
   used for self-fitting implants. Coatings have been successful in
   enhancing hydrophilicity, mechanical properties, anti-biofouling,
   antibacterial and anti-coagulative properties, adhesion, proliferation,
   and differentiation of cells on the coated surface. This review also
   discusses the challenges that need to be overcome for progression in
   this field.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present a novel methodology to
   produce a large boat hull with a foam additive manufacturing (FAM)
   process. To respond to shipping market needs, this new process is being
   developed. FAM technology is a conventional three-dimensional (3D)
   printing process whereby layers are deposited onto a high-pressure head
   mounted on a six-axis robotic arm. Traditionally, molds and masters are
   made with computer numerical control (CNC) machining or finished by
   hand. Handcrafting the molds is obviously time-consuming and
   labor-intensive, but even CNC machining can be challenging for parts
   with complex geometries and tight deadlines. Design/methodology/approach
   The proposed FAM technology focuses on the masters and molds, that are
   directly produced by 3D printing. This paper describes an additive
   manufacturing technology through which the operator can create a large
   part and its tools using the capacities of this new FAM technology.
   Findings The study shows a comparison carried out between the
   traditional manufacturing process and the additive manufacturing
   process, which is illustrated through an industrial case of application
   in the manufacturing industry. This work details the application of FAM
   technology to fabricate a 2.5 m boat hull mold and the results show the
   time and cost savings of FAM in the fabrication of large molds.
   Originality/value Finally, the advantages and drawbacks of the FAM
   technology are then discussed and novel features such as monitoring
   system and control to improve the accuracy of partly printed are
   highlighted.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing has been of great interest of research in various
   applications due to their ease in processability, cost effectiveness and
   adaptability. In this study Poly Lactic Acid (PLA) was used as the base
   polymer which was reinforced with Halloysite Nanotubes (HINT) powder as
   they are known to be biodegradable and has high mechanical properties
   individually.
   HINT loadings with 3\% and 5\% were added to PLA by the method of twin
   screw extrusion and pelletized. For comparison, the PLA on its own was
   also extruded and pelletized. The resultant homogeneous pellets was
   extruded successfully into filaments of 1.75 +/- 0.10 mm diameter using
   twin screw extruder with specialized die fixed to the extruder for the
   manufacture of production grade 3D printing filament. This resultant
   filament was utilized for Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) into standard
   tensile test bars and 25mm medical implants using a standard FFF
   printing machine.
   The 3D printed samples were characterized for mechanical properties by
   uniaxial tensile test and thermal stability by Differential scanning
   calorimetry. Interestingly there was no significant change in the
   mechanical properties of the 3D printed tensile bars due to the
   processing parameters during FFF. However, the decrease in cold
   crystallization temperature by DSC indicates the nucleating effect of
   the HINT on the PLA matrix which in turn increases the mechanical
   properties. We could successfully 3D print model medical implants. (C)

Title = {Integration of additive manufacturing and inkjet printed electronics: a
   potential route to parts with embedded multifunctionality},
Journal = {MANUFACTURING REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {3},
Number = {SI},
Month = {JUL 26},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing, an umbrella term for a number of different
   manufacturing techniques, has attracted increasing interest recently for
   a number of reasons, such as the facile customisation of parts, reduced
   time to manufacture from initial design, and possibilities in
   distributed manufacturing and structural electronics. Inkjet printing is
   an additive manufacturing technique that is readily integrated with
   other manufacturing processes, eminently scalable and used extensively
   in printed electronics. It therefore presents itself as a good candidate
   for integration with other additive manufacturing techniques to enable
   the creation of parts with embedded electronics in a timely and cost
   effective manner. This review introduces some of the fundamental
   principles of inkjet printing; such as droplet generation, deposition,
   phase change and post-deposition processing. Particular focus is given
   to materials most relevant to incorporating structural electronics and
   how post-processing of these materials has been able to maintain
   compatibility with temperature sensitive substrates. Specific obstacles
   likely to be encountered in such an integration and potential strategies
   to address them will also be discussed.},

Title = {Humidity-controlled direct ink writing for micro-additive manufacturing
   with water-based inks},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {69},
Pages = {583-592},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Direct-ink-writing type additive manufacturing with water-based inks
   such as hydrogels or polymer solutions is broadly utilized for
   bioprinting applications. However, the resolution of this implementation
   is limited due to the rapid ink drying experienced at small size scales
   leading to nozzle clogging and low fidelity prints. To address this
   issue, a humidity-controlled direct-ink-writing (HCDIW) approach is
   presented, where the microenvironment around the printing nozzle is
   controlled through introduction of aerosolized water. Using this
   approach, the nozzle microenvironment can be varied between
   undersaturated yet high relative humidity (ambient to 100\% RH) to
   oversaturated conditions where condensing droplets are deposited on the
   already printed ink filaments. The influence of the aerosolized water
   and the resultant micro-environment on the printing process was studied
   using water dissolved sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) ink,
   specifically focusing on nozzle clogging, printed filament geometry,
   surface quality and layer by layer stacking. These studies showed that
   the ink drying induced nozzle clogging issues can be mitigated through
   increased relative humidity at the nozzle exit and is virtually
   eliminated for similar to 100 mu m nozzles in oversaturated conditions.
   The decelerated ink drying under the effect of aerosolized water leads
   to reduced solute advection and skin formation. This in turn improves
   surface roughness while reducing adverse effects such as coffee-ring and
   void formation during additive manufacturing of micro-scale structures.
   Furthermore, layer-to-layer fusion and associated side-surface quality
   were improved specifically in undersaturated conditions. Reduction of
   deposited ink filament concentration in oversaturated conditions leads
   to excessive spreading of the deposited inks leading to geometric
   distortions. These results indicate that the humidity control approach
   can significantly improve the resolution of the direct-ink-writing
   approaches, enabling processing of water-based inks at micro-scales.},

Abstract = {In recent years, additive manufacturing methods became more and more
   prominent. Thereby, these techniques are mainly used in order to realize
   mechanical components. But the additive manufacturing technology offers
   a high potential in the field of optics as well. Owing to new design
   possibilities, completely new solutions are possible. We report on the
   realization of complex freeform optics using standard 3D printers. We
   briefly point out the characteristics of 3D printing and its influence
   on the optical properties. Additionally we address the needed rework of
   3D printed optical components. Therefore we apply two different methods
   - a robot-based fluid jet polishing and a coating method. The advantage
   of a 3D printed optic lies in its shape complexity. Thus different
   complex shaped optical elements are discussed. They are used for either
   metrology tasks or illumination tasks.},

Abstract = {Temperature effects are predominantly ignored when computing the dynamic
   response of structures. Yet, in applications where large changes in
   temperature occur, the dynamic response can drastically change. This is
   particularly true for polymers. While the temperature effects on modulus
   and loss factor are often available for most polymers, this change is
   not addressed or corrected for. Meanwhile, the recent research on
   additively manufactured polymer metastructures has yet to consider the
   effects of temperature change on their ability to suppress vibrations.
   In order to fill this gap, the study presented in this paper focuses on
   the effects of temperature change on additively manufactured structures.},

Title = {Fast, low-energy additive manufacturing of isotropic parts via reactive
   extrusion},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {41},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Despite the well-documented advantages of additive manufacturing (AM)
   compared to conventional manufacturing processes, most AM technologies
   are subject to some significant limitations, including slow processing
   times, substantial energy needs, and anisotropic part properties, which
   become even more important as part size increases. To address these
   limitations, a reactive extrusion AM (REAM) process is introduced, in
   which successive layers of a thermoset resin are deposited and cured
   rapidly in situ with no external energy input aside from that required
   to pump and position the resin. Mechanical properties of tensile
   specimens fabricated in multiple orientations indicate that the tensile
   modulus and ultimate strength are isotropic, but elongation at break and
   toughness depend on orientation. The isotropic properties are attributed
   to chemical crosslinking of polymer chains that occurs between layers of
   printed parts. Moreover, the tensile modulus and strength are influenced
   by the local thermal environment in the build, which varies within the
   build envelope because of the exothermic nature of the polymerization
   reaction and affects the degree of curing within the specimen. The
   degree of curing was measured via differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC) and was commensurate with the tensile strength of the tested
   coupons. When coupled with a large nozzle and high material flow rates,
   the REAM system can create nearly isotropic structural parts
   substantially more quickly than other AM systems, while using
   appreciably less energy at the point of manufacture.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a rapidly evolving technology being
   considered for nuclear applications. A special focus on AM to fabricate
   nuclear-grade silicon carbide (SiC) is explored in this paper. First, we
   present currently available AM processing options for SiC. AM methods
   commonly used for other ceramics, in which the feedstocks are forms of
   polymers, powders, and/or reactive chemical vapors, are also applicable
   to SiC. SiC phases are formed by pyrolysis of pre-ceramic polymer,
   direct reaction of powder precursors, sintering of SiC powders, or
   chemical vapor deposition/infiltration. Second, we discuss how the
   different microstructures of SiC materials fabricated by various
   processing methods affect their behavior in nuclear environments. Third,
   we discuss state-of-the-art AM technologies for the fabrication of
   relatively pure SiC, which show great potential to retain its strength
   under neutron irradiation: (1) binder jet printing followed by chemical
   vapor infiltration, (2) laser chemical vapor deposition, and (3)
   selective laser sintering of SiC powders. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The progress of additive manufacturing (AM), known as 3D-printing, has
   initiated a revolution in the new generation of biosensors and
   bioanalytical devices in recent years. The advancement in the resolution
   of AM has enabled the microfabrication of the architectures of
   electrodes and sensing layers for high-performance sensing. Diversiform
   printable materials, including biocompatible materials, polymers,
   various gels and metals, have enormously broadened the horizon in
   sensors and analytical devices for both research and commercial
   purposes. The considerable shortening of time and cost in sensor
   prototyping and fabrication has been reported and various highly
   customizable biosensing platforms and devices are under development.
   Herein, the most recent studies on the applications of AM in biosensors
   and bioanalytical devices are summarized with the aim to provide a
   panorama of emerging 3D-printing strategies for sensor design and
   bioanalytical device fabrication.},

Abstract = {The facile manufacture of PA12 MWCNT/silica (50/50 by weight)
   nanocomposite powders through a high energy mixing process is presented,
   which are useful to generate 3D objects by a novel Laser Polymer
   Deposition (LPD) process. The mixing as well as the LPD process led to
   no discernible changes in the material properties (DSC, SEM, LD) of the
   core-shell nanocomposites, enabling the recycling of unconverted powder.
   The built parts yield ultimate tensile stresses and Young's modulus at
   10\%-20\% of the bulk material. Partially unmolten particles and voids
   were identified as the main mechanical failure mechanism in the built
   parts. The mechanical properties are better with low additive content
   (Young's modulus: 89.8 +/- 5.4 MPa; UTS: 12.9 +/- 5.3 MPa with 0.25 wt\%
   additives). Electronic conductivity up to the region of moderate
   conductivity could be achieved by multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)
   network formation (8 x 10(-4) S cm(-1) at 1.25 wt\% of additives). A
   variant of the processing strategy revealed that a higher mechanical
   strength can be achieved by a laser induced remelting of the traces
   following their initial construction.},

Abstract = {Metals were deposited using wire-arc spray-on components made by 3D
   printing with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a water-soluble polymer. The
   polymer was then dissolved, leaving a metal layer whose surface
   topography was negative to that of the polymer. This is a rapid and
   low-cost alternative to 3D printing directly using metal, but to succeed
   it is essential for the sprayed metal to adhere to the polymer
   substrate. Tests were done in which aluminum and copper were sprayed
   using a twin-wire arc spray system onto 3D printed coupons, 50 x 50 mm
   in size, made from PVA, polylactic acid (PLA), and PLA mixed with metal
   (aluminum, copper) or carbon fiber. Adhesion depended on substrate
   roughness (minimum 1-2 mu m) substrate temperature (above the glass
   transition temperature but below the melting temperature of the polymer)
   and minimizing residual stresses due to mismatch of the thermal
   expansion coefficients of metal and polymer. It was shown that surface
   features could be made on metal components using this technique. Plates
   with internal flow passages were made by placing 3D printed PVA parts in
   channels machined in the plates, spraying metal over the polymer, and
   then dissolving the polymer.},

Abstract = {It is a well-known fact that in the field of modern manufacturing
   processes, additive manufacturing (AM) offers unexpected opportunities
   for creativity and rapid development. Compared with classical
   manufacturing technologies, AM offers the advantages of reducing weight
   and improving performance and offers excellent design capabilities for
   prototyping and rapid sample manufacture. To achieve its full potential
   regarding cost, durability, material consumption, and rigidity, as well
   as maintaining competitiveness, there are several research directions
   that have not been explored. One less frequently explored direction is
   the involvement of dimensional methods in obtaining an optimal and
   competitive final product. In this review, we intend to discuss the ways
   in which dimensional methods, such as geometric analogy, similarity
   theory, and dimensional analysis, are involved in addressing the
   problems of AM. To the best of our knowledge, it appears that this field
   of engineering has not fully maximized the advantages of these
   dimensional methods to date. In this review, we survey mainly
   polymer-based AM technology. We focus on the design and optimization of
   highly competitive products obtained using AM and also on the
   optimization of layer deposition, including their orientation and
   filling characteristics. With this contribution to the literature, we
   hope to suggest a fruitful direction for specialists involved in AM to
   explore the possibilities of modern dimensional analysis.},

Title = {Experimental and numerical analysis of the consolidation process for
   additive manufactured continuous carbon fiber-reinforced polyamide 12
   composites},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 12},
Abstract = {Substitution of conventional metal structures with fiber-reinforced
   polymers is possible because of their sustainable performance. One of
   the primary disadvantages of these composite materials is their high
   cost due to labor-intensive manufacturing. Because the fiber path can be
   steered directly along the load path, structures can be manufactured in
   a near-net shape, and a high degree of reproducibility with low scrap
   rates can be achieved. Additive manufacturing of these composite
   structures could enable cost efficiency with a high degree of
   complexity. However, the high degree of porosity and high void content
   between the printed fiber filaments results in unacceptable structural
   performance. Following the printing process, a post-consolidation
   process (additive fusion) can be performed to improve the mechanical
   performance of the part and use fiber-reinforced polymers for
   load-bearing applications. Numerical simulation of the consolidation
   process enables the production of these complex parts without expensive
   prototyping iterations. Because of the rapid and local changes in
   material stiffness, the simulation of the consolidation process is
   combined with a set of numerical model convergence problems. An advanced
   finite-element numerical model for simulating the consolidation process
   of additive manufactured continuous fiber composite parts is presented
   in this paper. The additive fusion step simulation allows for the
   evaluation of process-induced deformations, final engineering constants,
   and porosity. The simulation workflow is demonstrated and validated
   using experimental data from the manufacturing process of a typical
   aerospace part, specifically a helicopter hinge element.},

Abstract = {Recent technological advancements led to active research in the field of
   additive manufacturing (AM) thanks to its ability to fabricate complex
   structures with reduced material waste. While many studies focused on
   quasi-static performance of AM materials and structures, investigations
   on the dynamic performance of these materials are still limited,
   especially for polymers and composites. The aim of this research is to
   investigate the dynamic fracture behaviour of AM polymer composites
   under ballistic impact. Nylon reinforced with short carbon fibres was
   selected, and fused deposition modelling was used to fabricate solid
   quasi-isotropic structures. Quasi-static tensile and compression tests
   were carried out based on ASTM standards to characterise the
   elastic-plastic properties of the manufactured material. Based on these
   tests, the material's deformation and fracture behaviour can be
   considered elastic-brittle. Further, dynamic mechanical analysis was
   conducted under a frequency sweep at room temperature to examine the
   viscoelastic properties; the material exhibited high elastic behaviour.
   Then, ballistic impact tests were performed on solid plates using a gas
   gun with 9 mm spherical steel projectiles at velocities ranging from 95
   m s(-1) to 120 m s(-1). Post-experimental observation revealed the
   complete target perforation, with a circular hole at the front of the
   plates and delamination at the back. The dynamic experimental conditions
   were reproduced within the finite-element simulations, employing Hashin
   damage criteria via a user subroutine. A similar perforation was
   achieved at the front of the plate. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to investigate the material extrusion additive
   manufacturing (MEAM) deposition parameters for creating viable 3-D
   printed polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) structures with a balanced mix of
   mechanical and electrical properties. Design/methodology/approach
   Different combinations of deposition conditions are tested, and the
   influence of these parameters on the final dimensional accuracy,
   semi-crystalline phase microstructure and effective mechanical strength
   of MEAM homopolymer PVDF printed parts is experimentally assessed.
   Considering printed part integrity, appearance, print time and
   dimensional accuracy, MEAM parameters for PVDF are suggested. Findings A
   range of viable printing parameters for MEAM fabricated PVDF Kynar 740
   objects of different heights and in-plane length dimensions was
   determined. For PVDF structures printed under the suggested conditions,
   the mechanical response and the microstructure development related to
   Piezoelectric response are reported. Originality/value This research
   first reports on a range of parameters that have been confirmed to
   facilitate effective MEAM printing of 3-D PVDF objects, presents effects

   polymeric powders for use and re-use in additive manufacturing},
Journal = {MANUFACTURING REVIEW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), is one of the key components of the 4th
   industrial revolution. Polymer laser sintering (PLS) is a subset of AM
   that is commonly used to process polymers, and which achieves good
   surface finish, good mechanical properties of finished products and for
   which there is no need for support structures. However, the requirements
   for polymeric powder for PLS are strident. Moreover, PLS subjects
   polymeric feed powders to high temperatures that lead to degradation of
   their thermal, rheological, and physical properties and is thus an
   impediment to their recyclability. Therefore, it is imperative to
   investigate the degree of polymer degradation or aging before re-using
   the material. This paper reviews the common techniques that are employed
   to characterize the suitability of polymeric powders for use and re-use
   in the PLS process. These include, but are not limited to, differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), laser
   diffraction analysis, gas pycnometry, scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM), and melt flow index (MFI) testing.},

Abstract = {Fused Layer Manufacturing (FLM) is an additive technology based on
   polymer material extrusion. Due to variations in temperature during the
   manufacturing process and the resulting stress between the stacked
   layers, the final parts show anisotropic mechanical properties. One
   possible approach for their reduction is the immediate local preheating
   of the surface via laser radiation. At first, our research examines the
   influence of laser parameters as wavelength, power, velocity and area of
   impact for the preheating of the surface. In addition, an overview of
   possible parameter combinations is given based on the selection of raw
   materials, its colors, thicknesses and the manufacturing process.
   Initially, the absorption level of the materials regarding the emitted
   wavelength is detected using a spectrophotometer. Subsequently,
   preheating tests are conducted with different laser types while the
   temperature is determined by a thermal camera. The selected laser type
   is planned to get mounted on a prototype-machine for further in-situ
   preheating experiments on FLM parts during the manufacturing process.

Abstract = {Recent advancements in the additive manufacturing (AM) technology have
   increased its utilization in various engineering sectors for the
   development of end-use products. However, the limited choice of
   available materials tends to limit its application domain. Addition of
   nanoparticles can significantly improve the material properties of the
   AM parts. Moreover, nanoparticles can be added in different stages of
   the process which will play an important role in determining the
   increase in material properties. This aspect of the stage-dependent
   addition of nanoparticles in AM process has not been fully explored. The
   present work discusses the effect of adding nanoclay in three stages of
   AM process namely preprocessing, on-site and post-processing stage. It
   has been found that the nanoparticles interact in a different way with
   the polymer and result in different structure, morphology and
   mesostructure of the nanocomposites. The approach can be utilized for
   achieving improved material properties of AM-fabricated parts.},

   disinfection liquid concentrations. It has been registered that
   disinfection liquid penetrated void into material's volume, which caused
   an almost 20\% decrease in tensile properties in parts manufactured
   using a glycol-modified version of polyethylene terephthalate (PETG).},

Abstract = {Background: Identified research articles on Polyether ether ketone
   (PEEK) and its application in dentistry. Further identified the
   direction of evolution of this material through additive manufacturing
   (AM) in the field of dentistry.
   Materials and methods: PEEK is one of the suitable thermoplastic
   polymers which is biocompatible for the human body. We have identified
   related research articles through Scopus. A bibliometric analysis helped
   to achieve the targeted research objective.
   Results: Through Scopus search, 46 research articles were identified by
   using keywords as ``PEEK{''} ``Dentistry{''}. Doctors and scientists are
   using PEEK material in medical, and other associated fields to fulfil
   extensive requirements of customisation. Nowadays, PEEK is also being
   experimented in dentistry for developing implants and associated
   requirements. Therefore, by using AM technologies, PEEK-based implants
   provide a perfect match replica in lesser time and cost. Further, this
   paper identifies significant challenges of using this material with AM
   for dentistry. In the last, the paper identifies ten important
   application of PEEK in AM for dentistry.
   Conclusion: Additive manufacturing shows a significant achievement in
   the design \& development of dental implants, tools and devices using
   PEEK material. It helps in reduction of product development cycle time,
   cost, weight with improved quality of implants and helps fulfil various
   challenges faced in dentistry. This innovative technology works as
   concept generation and is easy to make a required modification for a
   product used in dentistry. Design and development of dentistry tool are
   done easily such as manufacturing of any implants for surgical planning
   and analysis whether the surgery will succeed or not. Therefore, this
   technology has application in the production of customised PEEK-based
   orthodontics, crowns, bridges, night guards and prosthodontics implants.},

Title = {Exploring the applicability of a simplified fully coupled

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL POLYMER PROCESSING},

Month = {MAR 28},
Abstract = {Prior literature employed a finite element based fully coupled algorithm
   that solved the flow/orientation coupling effects in extrusion
   deposition additive manufacturing, i.e., a key component for identifying
   the material properties of solidified deposited polymer composites.
   However, the complex iterative solution protocol reduces the
   computational capability of the algorithm. This paper simplifies the
   finite element based fully coupled algorithm by employing a scalar
   representation of the fourth order orientation tensor affected viscosity
   tensor. The revised code predicts similar fiber orientation results as
   compared to a related prior study. With the simplified fully coupled
   algorithm, effects of material deposition rate and fiber aspect ratio on
   a 2D planar large area extrusion deposition flow are explored, where the
   power law rheology model is employed for the flow simulation. Computed
   results show that an increased material deposition rate reduces the
   extrudate-swell ratio of the melt front and varies the local fiber
   orientation of the deposited bead especially near the flow region in
   contact with the substrate. Higher fiber aspect ratio enhances the
   principal fiber alignment of the extrusion and deposition flows, where
   the maximum local difference of the principal A(11) component is 23\%
   with increasing fiber aspect ratio from 10 to 25.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a technology that produces a part layer
   by layer based on the computer-aided designed (CAD) model. Each AM
   process is defined by a set of parameters and materials. The laser
   power, scan spacing and speed, preheating and bed temperatures, hatch
   length, pulse frequency, and part placement (coordinates of a part
   placed in the build) are among the most studied process parameters
   reported in the literature. Recent attention to improving part quality
   is caused by the possibility of using AM for manufacturing, but the
   inconsistency of results' repeatability is the main challenge that is
   not solved yet. This work attempts to improve the dimensional accuracy
   by predicting dimensional features of the part, namely length, width,
   and thickness. Data is collected from two identical runs done on EOS
   P395 polymer laser sintering system. By identical runs is meant that
   build layout, material and process parameters were kept constant in both
   runs. Pearson correlation test is used to identify whether the new
   parameters (the number of mesh triangles, surface, and volume of CAD
   model) are significantly correlated to dimensional features. Based on
   the correlation results, linear regression models are developed to
   predict dimensional features (compensate shrinkage effect). The obtained
   results are the following: models for thickness (in XZY orientation),
   length (in ZYX orientation), and length and thickness (in Angle
   orientation) can already be used to predict dimensional features (to
   minimize shrinkage effect by proposing scaling ratio for each specimen
   in the build separately).},

Abstract = {Facial and intraoral scanners as well as additive manufacturing (AM)

   The present article describes a digital workflow protocol for treatment

   The combination of facial digitalization and intraoral scans allowed a
   facially driven diagnostic waxing, while additive manufacturing
   technologies facilitate the translation of the digital waxing into the
   patient ` s mouth through an AM 3-piece silicone index which was
   designed into a buccal and a lingual clear flexible silicone indices
   that were fitted into a clear and rigid custom tray. This procedure
   facilitated the treatment planning procedures as well as assisted the
   direct composite restoration procedures, providing several advantages
   compared with conventional procedures such as precise translation of the
   digital diagnostic waxing into the patient ` s mouth, horizontal path of
   insertion of the silicone index, and minimized time of the clinical

Abstract = {Thermal management is a crucial factor affecting the performance and
   lifetime in several applications, such as electronics, generators, and
   heat exchangers. Additive manufacturing (AM) techniques provide a new
   revolution in manufacturing by expanding freedom for design and
   fabrication for complex geometries. One way to overcome these problems
   is by developing novel polymer-based composite materials with improved
   thermal conductivity properties for AM technologies. In this review, the
   fundamental principles of designing high thermal conductive polymer
   nanocomposites are presented. High thermal conductive polymer
   nanocomposites generally consist of the base polymer and thermally
   conductive filler materials such as aluminum oxide or boron nitride
   which are reviewed in detail. The factors affecting the thermal
   conductivity of composites, such as the filler loading and overall
   composite structure, are also summarized. This article stands on
   statistical data from technical papers published during 2000-2020 about
   the topics of fused deposition modeling (FDM) polymers or their thermal
   conductive composites. Finally, the most critical factors affecting the
   thermal conductivity of polymer nanocomposites are described in detail.
   Nonetheless, various novel techniques show the potential abilities of
   thermal conductivity of polymer nanocomposites usage by AM technologies,
   enabling applications in LED devices, energy, and electronic packaging.},

Title = {Polymer recycling codes for distributed manufacturing with 3-D printers},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {97},
Pages = {24-30},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {With the aggressive cost reductions for 3-D printing made available by
   the open-source self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) the
   economic advantage of custom distributed manufacturing has become
   substantial. In addition, the number of free designs is growing
   exponentially and the development and commercialization of the
   recyclebot (plastic extruders that fabricate 3-D printing filament from
   recycled or virgin materials) have greatly improved the material
   selection available for prosumer 3-D printer operators. These trends
   indicate that more individuals will manufacturer their own polymer
   products, however, there is a risk that an even larger fraction of
   polymer waste will not be recycled because it has not been coded. The
   current limited resin identification code available in the U.S.
   similarly restricts closing the loop on less popular polymers, which
   could hamper the environmental impact benefits of distributed
   manufacturing. This paper provides a solution for this challenge by (1)
   developing a recycling code model based off of the resin identification
   codes developed in China that is capable of expansion as more complex
   3-D printing materials are introduced, (2) creating OpenSCAD scripts
   based on (1) to be used to print resin identification codes into
   products, (3) demonstrating the use of this functionality in a selection
   of products and polymer materials, and (4) outlining the software and
   policy tools necessary to make this application possible for widespread
   adoption. Overall the results showed that a far larger resin code
   identification system can be adopted in the U.S. to expand distributed
   recycling of polymers and manufacturing of plastic-based 3-D printed
   products. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Quadruple Hydrogen Bonding Supramolecular Elastomers for Melt Extrusion
   Additive Manufacturing},

Abstract = {This manuscript describes the versatility of highly directional,
   noncovalent interactions, i.e., quadruple hydrogen bonding (QHB), to
   afford novel polyurea segmented supramolecular polymers for melt
   extrusion three-dimensional (3D) printing processes. The molecular
   design of the polyurea elastomers features (1) flexible polyether
   segments and relatively weak urea hydrogen-bonding sites in the soft
   segments to provide elasticity and toughness, and (2) strong
   ureido-cytosine (UCyt) QHB in the hard segments to impart enhanced
   mechanical integrity. The resulting polyureas were readily
   compression-molded into mechanically-robust, transparent, and creasable
   films. Optimization of polyurea composition offered a rare combination
   of high tensile strength (95 MPa), tensile elongation (788\% strain),
   and toughness (94 MJ/m(3)), which are superior to a commercially
   available Ninjaflex elastomer. The incorporation of QHB facilitated melt
   processability, where hydrogen bonding dissociation provided low
   viscosities at printing temperatures. During cooling, directional
   self-assembly of UCyt QHB facilitated the solidification process and
   contributed to part fidelity with the formation of a robust physical
   network. The printed objects displayed high layer fidelity, smooth
   surfaces, minimal warpage, and complex geometries. The presence of
   highly directional QHB effectively diminished mechanical anisotropy, and
   the printed samples exhibited comparable Young's moduli along (x-y
   direction, 0 degrees) and perpendicular to (z-direction, 90 degrees) the
   layer direction. Remarkably, the printed samples exhibited ultimate
   tensile strains approaching 500\% in the z-direction prior to failure,
   which was indicative of improved interlayer adhesion. Thus, this design
   paradigm, which is demonstrated for novel polyurea copolymers, suggests
   the potential of supramolecular polymers with enhanced mechanical
   performance, melt processability, recydability, and improved interlayer
   adhesion for melt extrusion additive manufacturing processes.},

Title = {Analysis of Multi-scale Mechanical Properties of Ceramic Trusses
   Prepared from Preceramic Polymers (Revision Prepared for <i>Additive
   Manufacturing</i>)},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {To better understand the impact of complex structure on mechanical
   properties in additively manufactured ceramics, truss structures were 3D
   printed in preceramic polymer and mechanically evaluated in the
   pyrolyzed SiOC state. Specimens were printed using digital light
   processing with a siloxane polymer resin blend. Four different designs
   were printed: two bending-dominant Kelvin cell structures, a
   stretching-dominant octet structure, and a mixture of the two with
   geometries chosen for equivalent stiffness. Mechanical characterization
   was done at multiple length scales: uniaxial compression to evaluate the
   entire truss structure, and three-point flexure to assess individual
   beam elements. After pyrolysis, it was found that truss designs
   exhibited different shrinkages at the beam element scale despite being
   composed of the same preceramic polymer and exhibiting isotropic
   shrinkage at the macro-truss scale. This manner of nonuniform shrinkage
   has rarely, if ever been reported, as it is standard practice in
   additive manufacturing to report only bulk linear shrinkage. In uniaxial
   compression, Kelvin structures with thicker beams exhibited the highest
   strength of 10 MPa, and octet structures exhibited the lowest strength
   of 3.8 MPa. In beam element flexure however, the octet beams had the
   highest strength, 1.9 GPa, four times stronger than the Kelvin beam
   elements and 500 times stronger than the octet bulk structure. Lastly,
   the implications for interchangeable truss structures are discussed.},

Abstract = {Considering the potential for new product design possibilities and the
   reduction of environmental impacts, Additive Manufacturing (AM)
   processes are considered to possess significant advantages for
   automotive, aerospace and medical equipment industries. One of the
   commercial AM techniques is Binder-jetting (BJ). This technique can be
   used to process a variety of materials including stainless steel,
   ceramic, polymer and glass. However, there is very limited research
   about this AM technology on energy consumption aspect. This paper
   presents a method to build an energy consumption model for printing
   stage of BJ process. Mathematical analyses are performed to find out the
   correlation between the energy consumption and geometry of the
   manufactured part. Based on the analyses, total energy consumption is
   calculated as a function of part geometry and printing parameters.
   Finally, test printing is performed to check the accuracy of the model.
   This process model provides a tool to optimise part geometry design with
   respect to energy consumption.},

Abstract = {There is an ever-growing push toward sustainability and green
   manufacturing in a wide array of industries, especially 3D printing,
   which is now recognized as a viable manufacturing method. The number of
   studies focusing on leveraging additive manufacturing of natural
   products continues to grow, with key areas of interest including
   exciting chemistries or modifications of natural products toward 3D
   printable materials, advancements in prototypes or products by changing
   feedstocks to green or bioderived alternatives, and the introduction of
   added functionalities or properties. This includes concepts such as
   processing natural or bioderived polymers into filament for
   extrusion-based 3D printing, the design of photopolymer resins and inks
   for vat photopolymerizations, jet printing, or direct ink writing
   processes, and the use of powders for selective laser sintering. The
   strategies employed to achieve materials suitable for 3D printing, the
   physical properties of the materials, and the resultant applications
   including strengths and limitations, will be explored in this review.
   Overall, the advancements in the field are leading to future
   opportunities in biomaterials and medical devices, electronics and
   batteries, and environmental remediation and water purification.},

Abstract = {In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) micromanipulator mounted on a
   glass capillary is developed for handling biological samples, such as
   multicellular spheroids and embryos. To fabricate the micromanipulator,
   we developed an additive manufacturing system based on high-resolution
   microstereolithography using a 405-nm blue laser. The fabrication system
   makes it possible to fabricate 3D microstructures on a glass capillary
   with 2.5 mu m lateral resolution and 25 mu m layer thickness. We also
   demonstrated the capture and release of a spheroid with the
   micromanipulator fabricated using our additive manufacturing system. We
   showed that spheroids can be easily handled by a simple operation with
   minimal damage using a cage-like multiple finger structure. Additive
   manufacturing of tailor-made micromanipulators mounted on a glass
   capillary will be useful in biological and tissue engineering research.},

Title = {Additive manufacturing-inspired approach to re-manufacture fiber
   reinforced plastic with programmable orientation of recycled carbon
   fiber},
Journal = {COMPOSITES COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The carbon fiber recycled from end-of-life Carbon Fiber Reinforced
   Plastic (CFRP) offers a low-cost and environmentally friendly option to
   produce CFRP parts. However, the reclaimed carbon fibers (rCFs) are
   usually in a discontinuous and disordered form, which limits the
   performance of fiber-filled composite. An additive
   manufacturing-inspired approach is proposed to re-manufacture CFRP, in
   which the rCFs were dispersed and orderly deposited to form a slice of
   pre-defined rCF sheet with programmable fiber orientation, then the rCF
   sheets were stuck layer by layer to fabricate aligned rCF reinforced
   plastic (rCFRP). Experiments show that preferential alignment degree,
   flexible strength and electric conductivity of designedly aligned rCFRP
   were 0.96, 393.53 MPa and 7.23 x 10-1 S/cm, respectively, which are
   significantly higher than the unoriented rCFRP (0.28, 217.59 MPa and
   1.07 x 10-2 S/cm). This approach paves the way for additively
   fabricating rCFRP parts with customized performance by arranging rCFs
   orientation.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a curved-layer additive manufacturing technology
   that has the potential to print plastic components with integral
   conductive polymer electronic circuits. Researchers at AUT University in
   New Zealand and the National University of Singapore have developed a
   novel Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process in which the layers of
   material that make up the part are deposited as curved layers instead of
   the conventional flat layers. This technology opens up possibilities of
   building curved plastic parts that have conductive electronic tracks and
   components printed as an integral part of the plastic component, thereby
   eliminating printed circuit boards and wiring. It is not possible to do
   this with existing flat-layer additive manufacturing technologies as the
   continuity of a circuit could be interrupted between the layers. With
   curved-layer fused deposition modeling (CLFDM) this problem is removed
   as continuous filaments in 3 dimensions can be produced, allowing for
   continuous conductive circuits.},

Abstract = {The propagation of shocks through additively-manufactured (AM) polymeric
   structures containing multiple length scales of engineered porosity is
   studied both experimentally and computationally. In this study, a
   single-stage light gas gun is used to impact cube-shaped specimens, 40
   mm on a side, instrumented with photon Doppler velocimeter (PDV) light
   probes to capture free surface velocities and side-looking high-speed
   video to capture deformation history. A combined Eulerian-Lagrangian
   finite element (FE) model has been developed which reproduces the
   majority of the observed experimental trends, based on an
   independently-measured shock Hugoniot for the bulk AM polymer. After
   initial calibration, the FE model has been used to suggest candidate
   geometries for experimental investigation, based on the desired shock
   response. Geometries for structurally-efficient shock mitigation have
   been investigated. In a separate set of experiments, miniature (6 mm x 6
   mm) square specimens have been impacted at the Dynamic Compression
   Sector at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), and imaged using x-ray Phase
   Contrast Imaging (PCI). This technique gives strong evidence for the
   propagation of discrete shocks within the engineered foam structures, in
   agreement with our models.},

Title = {Optimization Methodology for Additive Manufacturing of Customized Parts
   by Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). Application to a Shoe Heel},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing technologies offer important new manufacturing
   possibilities, but its potential is so big that only with the support of
   other technologies can it really be exploited. In that sense, parametric
   design and design optimization tools appear as two appropriate
   complements for additive manufacturing. Synergies existing between these
   three technologies allow for integrated approaches to the design of
   customized and optimized products. While additive manufacturing makes it
   possible to materialize overly complex geometries, parametric design
   allows designs to be adapted to custom characteristics and optimization
   helps to choose the best solution according to the objectives. This work
   represents an application development of a previous work published in
   Polymers which exposed the general structure, operation and
   opportunities of a methodology that integrates these three technologies
   by using visual programming with Grasshopper. In this work, the
   different stages of the methodology and the way in which each one
   modifies the final design are exposed in detail, applying it to a case
   study: the design of a shoe heel for FDM-an interesting example both
   from the perspectives of ergonomic and mass customization. Programming,
   operation and results are exposed in detail showing the complexity,
   usefulness and potential of the methodology, with the aim of helping
   other researchers to develop proposals in this line.},

   particular, the revolutionary applications of AM in biomedical,
   aerospace, buildings and protective structures were discussed. The
   current state of materials development, including metal alloys, polymer
   composites, ceramics and concrete, was presented. In addition, this
   paper discussed the main processing challenges with void formation,
   anisotropic behaviour, the limitation of computer design and
   layer-by-layer appearance. Overall, this paper gives an overview of 3D

Abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) appears to be the best candidate to
   manufacture random architected materials, as it offers significant
   freedom in the design of hollowed parts with complex geometry. However,
   when these structures are needed with thins walls and struts, AM
   processes may encounter difficulties in properly manufacturing these
   structures due to their capability limits. This study proposes to
   characterize the manufacturing of random architected structures to see
   firstly their fabricability and the capability of the additive
   manufacturing processes used, such as vat photopolymerization
   (Stereolithography process (SLA)), material extrusion (Fused Filament
   Fabrication process (FFF)) and powder bed fusion (Selective Laser
   Sintering process (SLS)) through tomographic, dimensional, and mass
   analysis. Several defects specific to each process were identified. A
   higher predominance of porosities, lack of printing and excess of
   material manifests as trapped or partially fused powder for SLS and
   angel hair for FFF. These defects strongly affect the dimensional and
   geometric accuracy of the struts and, thus, the final mass of the
   structure obtained with these two processes. The SLA process makes it
   possible to print thinner details of random architected structures with
   better material quality and good dimensional and geometric accuracy,
   under the conditions and protocol used in this study.},

Abstract = {Research on additive manufacturing (AM) of
   high-performancepolymersprovides novel materials and technologies for
   advanced applicationsin different sectors, such as aerospace and
   biomedical engineering.The present article is contextualized in this
   research trend by describinga novel AM protocol for processing a
   polysulfone (PSU)/N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solution into medical
   implant prototypes.In particular, an AM technique involving the
   patterned depositionof the PSU/NMP mixture in a coagulation bath was
   employed to fabricatePSU implants with different predefined shape, fiber
   diameter, andmacropore size. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis
   highlighteda fiber transversal cross-section morphology characterized by
   a denseexternal skin layer and an inner macroporous/microporous
   structure,as a consequence of the nonsolvent-induced polymer
   solidificationprocess. Physical-chemical and thermal characterization of
   the fabricatedsamples demonstrated that PSU processing did not affect
   its macromolecularstructure and glass-transition temperature, as well as
   that afterpost-processing PSU implants did not contain residual solvent
   or nonsolvent.Mechanical characterization showed that the developed PSU
   scaffoldtensile and compressive modulus could be changed by varying the
   macroporousarchitecture. In addition, PSU scaffolds supported the in
   vitro adhesionand proliferation of the BALB/3T3 clone A31 mouse embryo
   cell line.These findings encourage further research on the suitability
   of thedeveloped processing method for the fabrication of customized
   PSUimplants.},

Title = {Additive manufacturing of vascular stents},
Journal = {ACTA BIOMATERIALIA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {167},
Pages = {16-37},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {With the advancement of additive manufacturing (AM), customized vascular
   stents can now be fabricated to fit the curvatures and sizes of a
   narrowed or blocked blood vessel, thereby reducing the possibility of
   thrombosis and restenosis. More importantly, AM enables the design and
   fabrication of complex and functional stent unit cells that would
   otherwise be impossible to realize with conventional manufacturing
   techniques. Additionally, AM makes fast design iterations possible while
   also shortening the development time of vascular stents. This has led to
   the emergence of a new treatment paradigm in which custom and
   on-demand-fabricated stents will be used for just-in-time treatments.
   This review is focused on the recent advances in AM vascular stents
   aimed at meeting the mechanical and biological requirements. First, the
   biomaterials suitable for AM vascular stents are listed and briefly
   described. Second, we review the AM technologies that have been so far
   used to fabricate vascular stents as well as the performances they have
   achieved. Subsequently, the design criteria for the clinical application
   of AM vascular stents are discussed considering the currently
   encountered limitations in materials and AM techniques. Finally, the
   remaining challenges are highlighted and some future research directions
   are proposed to realize clinically-viable AM vascular stents.Vascular
   stents have been widely used for the treatment of vascular disease. The
   recent progress in addi-tive manufacturing (AM) has provided
   unprecedented opportunities for revolutionizing traditional vascu-lar
   stents. In this manuscript, we review the applications of AM to the
   design and fabrication of vascular stents. This is an interdisciplinary
   subject area that has not been previously covered in the published
   review articles. Our objective is to not only present the
   state-of-the-art of AM biomaterials and technolo-gies but to also
   critically assess the limitations and challenges that need to be
   overcome to speed up the clinical adoption of AM vascular stents with
   both anatomical superiority and mechanical and biological
   functionalities that exceed those of the currently available
   mass-produced devices.\& COPY; 2023 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {The incorporation of structural color into 3D printed parts is reported,
   presenting an alternative to the need for pigments or dyes for colored
   parts produced through additive manufacturing. Thermoplastic build
   materials composed of dendritic block copolymers were designed,
   synthesized, and used to additively manufacture plastic parts exhibiting
   structural color. The reflection properties of the photonic crystals
   arise from the periodic nanostructure formed through block copolymer
   self-assembly during polymer processing. The wavelength, of reflected
   light could be tuned across the visible spectrum by synthetically
   controlling the block copolymer molecular weight and manufacture parts
   that reflected violet, green, or orange light with the capacity to serve
   as selective optical filters and light guides.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing offers reduced lead time between design and

   material extrusion additive manufacturing, enables the production of
   custom-made parts with complex geometry. Despite the numerous advantages

   investigated the tensile behavior of a model polycarbonate system to
   explore what leads to different tensile properties, including sources of
   ductile versus brittle fracture. We utilized a one factor at a time
   (OFAT) design of experiments (DOE), printed single road-width boxes, and
   performed tensile tests on specimens from these boxes. Additionally, we
   characterized the cross-sections of parts printed under different
   conditions and their subsequent fracture behavior. The results
   demonstrate that isotropic bulk properties are achievable by printing at
   high speeds, and provide mechanisms to explain why.HighlightsPrinting at
   high speeds leads to improved mechanical properties.Printed samples
   undergo a mix of ductile and brittle failure.Jagged fracture path is

Abstract = {Flexible electrochemical sensors for measurement and quantification of
   biomarkers are attracting a great deal of attention in non-invasive
   medical applications, due to their high mechanical compatibility and
   conformability with the human body. Realization of the full potential of
   such novel systems relies heavily on their effective manufacturing.
   Particularly, there is a need for manufacturing techniques that can
   realize complex designs, consisting of multiple functional materials
   which are required for sensor functionality. Among emerging additive
   manufacturing techniques, Direct-Ink-Writing (DIW), where polymer
   nanocomposite inks are dispensed through nozzles and deposited with high
   spatial control, carries a great potential to address this need. Here,
   we introduce a 3D printed flexible electrochemical biosensor for glucose
   detection. We show that our biosensor works linearly in glucose solution
   with a concentration range between 100 and 1000 mM. The sensitivity of
   glucose biosensor is estimated to be 17.5 nA mu M-1, and the calculated
   value of the detection limit (S/N = 3) is 6.9 mu M. The demonstrated
   electrochemical performance and surface properties of the printed
   sensors show the promising advantages of using this technique over the
   conventional screen printing method. These advantages include higher
   sensitivity and specificity and, reduced material consumption. (C) 2018

   microstructures of the samples were also examined. The effects of the
   short-carbon fiber fillers on the mechanical properties of 3D-printed
   PLA were investigated, and the effects of the annealing process on
   polymer crystallinity and mechanical properties. The annealing process
   was shown to increase the crystallinity of both sample groups, though no
   statistically significant effect of annealing on mechanical properties
   was observed. The tensile properties of the PLA and PLA/CF filaments
   showed that the addition of carbon fibers to the PLA filament led to a
   significant increase in elastic modulus of the MEAM samples.},

Title = {Polymer Composites Based on Glycol-Modified Poly(Ethylene Terephthalate)
   Applied to Additive Manufacturing Using Melted and Extruded
   Manufacturing Technology},

Abstract = {As part of the work, innovative polymer composites dedicated to 3D
   printing applications were developed. For this purpose, the influence of
   modified fillers, such as silica modified with alumina, bentonite
   modified with quaternary ammonium salt, and hybrid filler lignin/silicon
   dioxide, on the functional properties of composites based on
   glycol-modified poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET-G) was investigated.
   In the first part of the work, using the proprietary technological line,
   filaments from unfilled polymer and its composites were obtained, which
   contained modified fillers in an amount from 1.5\% to 3.0\% by weight.
   The fittings for the testing of functional properties were obtained
   using the 3D printing technique in the Melted and Extruded Manufacturing
   (MEM) technology and the injection molding technique. In a later part of
   the work, rheological properties such as mass melt flow rate (MFR) and
   viscosity, and mechanical properties such as Rockwell hardness, Charpy
   impact strength, and static tensile strength with Young's modulus were
   presented. The structure of the obtained composites was also described
   and determined using scanning electron microscopy with an attachment for
   the microanalysis of chemical composition (SEM/EDS) and the atomic force
   microscope (AFM). The correct dispersion of the fillers in the polymer
   matrix was confirmed by wide-angle X-ray scattering analysis (WAXS). In
   turn, the physicochemical properties were presented on the basis of the
   research results: thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
   (FT-IR). On the basis of the obtained results, it was found that both
   the amount and the type of fillers used significantly affected the
   functional properties of the tested composites.},

Abstract = {Novel poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate)(PHBH)/fibrillated
   nanocellulose biodegradable composites for additive manufacturing were
   produced and characterized. Fibrillated nanocellulose (NCF) was isolated
   with high energy ultrasonication and dispersed via solution mixing in
   the polymer matrix. Composite filaments having a nanofiller
   concentration of 0.5wt\%, 1wt\% and 3wt\% were then extruded,
   characterized and used in fused deposition modeling (FDM). Neat PHBH
   powder was then manually added to prepare a solid mixture at different
   fibrillated nanocellulose concentrations (from 0.5 to 3 wt\%), to be
   then used to feed an extruder. SEM observations on filaments and 3D
   printed samples evidenced the good dispersion of fibrillated
   nanocellulose inside the matrix with the presence of agglomerates at
   higher NCF contents. The beneficial effects of the fibrillated
   nanocellulose in terms of stress at break and of elongation at break
   showed a maximum at a fibrillated nanocellulose content of 0.5 wt\%.
   Moreover, the presence of fibrillated nanocellulose did not affect the
   thermal degradation behaviour of the materials, and also the glass
   transition and the melting temperatures were not influenced by NCF
   addition.},

Title = {Investigations on the melt flow behaviour of aluminium filled ABS
   polymer composite for the extrusion-based additive manufacturing process},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIALS \& PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {59},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {194-211},
Abstract = {In extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) process, the melt flow
   rate (MFR) of material plays a significant role in determining the
   suitable process parameters for printing parts. MFR of the polymers
   varies on the addition of fillers which eventually leads to alteration
   in the pre-set values of process parameters. The present study deals
   with the evaluation of MFR of aluminium (Al) filled acrylonitrile
   butadiene styrene (ABS) polymer matrix composite using melt flow index
   tester for extrusion-based AM process. L16 Taguchi OA method was used to
   design the experiments considering three factors and four levels.
   Extrusion temperature, extrusion load and filler loading (wt.\% of Al)
   were considered as the input factors, while MFR was selected as the
   measured response. Furthermore, the significance of each factor was
   determined using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and signal-to-noise (SN)
   ratio techniques. Experimental results indicated the improvement in the
   MFR for 10 wt.\% Al filled ABS composite. However, the opposite trend in
   MFR was observed for other combinations of ABS/Al. Based on obtained MFR
   results, process parameters were established to print parts of developed
   ABS/Al composite through a customised extrusion-based AM process. The
   present study may be useful in the fabrication of customised lightweight
   conductive structures.},

Title = {A Brief Review on Additive Manufacturing of Polymeric Composites and
   Nanocomposites},
Journal = {MICROMACHINES},
Year = {2021},

Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this research article, a mini-review study is performed on the
   additive manufacturing (AM) of the polymeric matrix composites (PMCs)
   and nanocomposites. In this regard, some methods for manufacturing and
   important and applied results are briefly introduced and presented. AM
   of polymeric matrix composites and nanocomposites has attracted great
   attention and is emerging as it can make extensively customized parts
   with appreciably modified and improved mechanical properties compared to
   the unreinforced polymer materials. However, some matters must be
   addressed containing reduced bonding of reinforcement and matrix, the
   slip between reinforcement and matrix, lower creep strength, void
   configurations, high-speed crack propagation, obstruction because of
   filler inclusion, enhanced curing time, simulation and modeling, and the
   cost of manufacturing. In this review, some selected and significant
   results regarding AM or three-dimensional (3D) printing of polymeric
   matrix composites and nanocomposites are summarized and discuss. In
   addition, this article discusses the difficulties in preparing composite
   feedstock filaments and printing issues with nanocomposites and short
   and continuous fiber composites. It is discussed how to print various
   thermoplastic composites ranging from amorphous to crystalline polymers.
   In addition, the analytical and numerical models used for simulating AM,
   including the Fused deposition modeling (FDM) printing process and
   estimating the mechanical properties of printed parts, are explained in
   detail. Particle, fiber, and nanomaterial-reinforced polymer composites
   are highlighted for their performance. Finally, key limitations are
   identified in order to stimulate further 3D printing research in the
   future.},

Title = {Network toughening of additively manufactured, high glass transition

Journal = {POLYMER INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {6, SI},
Pages = {749-758},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Vinyl ester and epoxy-amine resins are used to produce polymeric
   materials for numerous commercial and military applications due to their
   relatively high moduli (>2 GPa), glass transition temperatures (T(g)s)
   (>= 120 degrees C) and adequate fracture toughness (G(1C) approximate to
   200-250 J m(-2)). Most commercially available vinyl ester and
   epoxy-amine resins are typically cured into polymeric materials via
   traditional manufacturing techniques, such as resin transfer molding and
   thermal curing. However, additive manufacturing (AM) has gained
   significant traction as a favorable manufacturing technique over
   traditional methods due to the ability to create customizable parts with
   complex geometries on-demand. Manipulation of polymer network
   connectivity using a dual-cure mechanism of methacrylate free radical
   cure via stereolithography (SLA) and epoxy-amine thermal cure for thein
   situcreation of interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) for AM was
   investigated. Resins and formulations of individual monomers bearing
   both vinyl ester and epoxy functionality were either synthesized or
   formulated to elucidate the effect of interconnecting the two networks
   at the molecular level. The formation of a multi-mechanistic,
   interconnected, sequentially cured IPN via SLA yielded polymeric
   materials with glass transition temperatures that exceeded 120 degrees
   C. Polymer network connectivity was shown to have a minimal impact on
   thermomechanical and thermogravimetric properties. IPN formation was
   shown to afford materials with high storage moduli (E ` values as high
   as 3.2 GPa), tensile strengths (as high as 51 MPa), Young's moduli
   (exceeding 3.5 GPa) and fracture energies (as high as 790 J m(-2)). (c)

Title = {Optimisation procedure for additive manufacturing processes based on
   mask image projection to improve Z accuracy and resolution},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {31},
Pages = {689-702},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Mask image projection is an additive manufacturing (AM) technique used
   in photocurable materials which allows the simultaneous energy delivery
   in a whole area instead of a single spot. A common problem for this AM
   process is the uncontrolled penetration of light energy, which could
   cause a solidification of non-desired layers. In this paper, an
   optimization procedure is developed and presented in order to increase Z
   accuracy and resolution of printed parts through the control of the
   total accumulated dose and the photocuring conversion ratio of each
   spatial location of the manufacturing volume. Consequently, the
   uncontrolled monomer-to-polymer conversion of down-facing surfaces could
   be reduced. A finite element strategy is used in the optimisation
   procedure to obtain a full discretization of the whole manufacturing
   domain. Furthermore, experimental tests have been done to compare
   experimental results and numerical estimations. The results show that
   the use of the optimisation procedure increases the accuracy and
   resolution of printed parts along the manufacturing direction. (C) 2018

Abstract = {Additively manufactured components often require temporary support
   material to prevent the component from collapsing or warping during
   fabrication. Whether these support materials are removed chemically as
   in the case of many polymer additive manufacturing processes, or
   mechanically as in the case of (for example) Direct Metal Laser
   Sintering, the use of sacrificial material increases total material
   usage, build time, and time required in post-fabrication treatments. The
   goal of this work is to embed a minimum allowable self-supporting angle
   within the topology optimization framework such that designed components
   and structures may be manufactured without the use of support material.
   This is achieved through a series of projection operations that combine
   a local projection to enforce minimum length scale requirements and a
   support region projection to ensure a feature is adequately supported
   from below. The magnitude of the self-supporting angle is process
   dependent and is thus an input variable provided by the manufacturing or
   design engineer. The algorithm is demonstrated on standard minimum
   compliance topology optimization problems and solutions are shown to
   satisfy minimum length scale, overhang angle, and volume constraints,
   and are shown to be dependent on the allowable magnitudes of these
   constraints.},

Title = {Bead parameterization of desktop and room-scale material extrusion
   additive manufacturing: How print speed and thermal properties affect
   heat transfer},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Material extrusion (MatEx) additive manufacturing ranges in size from
   the desktop scale fused filament fabrication (FFF) to the room scale big
   area additive manufacturing (BAAM). The principles of how FFF and BAAM
   operate are similar - polymer feedstocks are heated until molten and
   then extruded to form three-dimensional parts through layer-by-layer
   additive manufacturing. However, the scales of FFF and BAAM differ
   substantially, which leads to critical differences in thermal behavior
   for these thermally-driven processes. This study compares heat transfer
   in FFF and BAAM using finite element thermal modeling. Parameterization
   is performed across material properties, layer number, and print speed
   at the desktop and room scale for MatEx. BAAM stays hotter than FFF for
   a longer period of time, which facilitates interlayer diffusion and weld
   formation, but can also lead to slumping or sagging. Changes in thermal
   diffusivity affect FFF more than BAAM, with FFF exhibiting a local
   maximum in weld time at the thermal diffusivity of ABS. In all cases,
   weld time is longer than relaxation time, indicating that polymer
   reorientation and interdiffusion is possible. For BAAM, the temperature
   and thermal history of the center of an extruded bead differs greatly
   from the surface of the bead, which has important implications for
   process monitoring, property prediction, and part performance.},

Title = {Additive manufacturing techniques for the fabrication of tissue
   engineering scaffolds: a review},

Abstract = {Purpose - Additive manufacturing (AM) or solid freeform fabrication
   (SFF) technique is extensively used to produce intrinsic 3D structures
   with high accuracy. Its significant contributions in the field of tissue
   engineering (TE) have significantly increased in the recent years. TE is
   used to regenerate or repair impaired tissues which are caused by
   trauma, disease and injury in human body. There are a number of novel
   materials such as polymers, ceramics and composites, which possess
   immense potential for production of scaffolds. However, the major
   challenge is in developing those bioactive and patient-specific
   scaffolds, which have a required controlled design like pore
   architecture with good interconnectivity, optimized porosity and
   microstructure. Such design not only supports cell proliferation but
   also promotes good adhesion and differentiation. However, the
   traditional techniques fail to fulfill all the required specific
   properties in tissue scaffold. The purpose of this study is to report
   the review on AM techniques for the fabrication of TE scaffolds.
   Design/methodology/approach - The present review paper provides a
   detailed analysis of the widely used AM techniques to construct tissue
   scaffolds using stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering
   (SLS), fused deposition modeling (FDM), binder jetting (BJ) and advanced
   or hybrid additive manufacturing methods.
   Findings - Subsequently, this study also focuses on understanding the
   concepts of TE scaffolds and their characteristics, working principle of
   scaffolds fabrication process. Besides this, mechanical properties,
   characteristics of microstructure, in vitro and in vivo analysis of the
   fabricated scaffolds have also been discussed in detail.
   Originality/value - The review paper highlights the way forward in the
   area of additive manufacturing applications in TE field by following a
   systematic review methodology.},

Abstract = {The creation of tools by additive manufacturing is becoming increasingly
   convenient for CFRP one-off and small batch production. Screw extrusion
   additive manufacturing of thermoplastic polymers has boosted the
   development of large format manufacturing solutions. Interlayer adhesion
   and anisotropic properties of a 3D printed part are indisputably key
   aspects of tool manufacturing process. In this study, thermal and
   mechanical properties of large format 40\% carbon fiber reinforced
   polyamide 6 3D printed tools were determined. Moreover, the influence on
   part performance of two main printing parameters, deposition temperature
   and extruding pressure, was analyzed with respect to polymer melt
   rheology. The printed material revealed a highly anisotropic thermal and
   mechanical behavior associated with the alignment of the high carbon
   fiber content. The optimal process window was identified in terms of
   substrate deposition temperature. Along the print direction, no major
   impact on tensile and flexural mechanical properties was detected, while
   the injection molding values were exceeded by approximately 10\%. The
   layer adhesion was estimated by measuring the stress at break on
   transversely Z-oriented specimens. Higher deposition temperatures and
   pressures, combined with lower viscosity, promote wetting and bond
   formation between layers, ultimately leading to more consistent
   performances. The best results in the transverse direction were achieved
   between 140 and 160 degrees C, reaching roughly a fifth of the
   longitudinal values. A significant drop in performance was detected
   below 120 degrees C, which was identified as the minimum process
   temperature. A post-process annealing heat treatment was also
   investigated, no beneficial outcomes were reported.},

Title = {Polymers in pharmaceutical additive manufacturing: A balancing act
   between printability and product performance},
Journal = {ADVANCED DRUG DELIVERY REVIEWS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {177},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Materials and manufacturing processes share a common purpose of enabling
   the pharmaceutical product to perform as intended. This review on the
   role of polymeric materials in additive manufacturing of oral dosage
   forms, focuses on the interface between the polymer and key stages of
   the additive manufacturing process, which determine printability. By
   systematically clarifying and comparing polymer functional roles and
   properties for a variety of AM technologies, together with current and
   emerging techniques to characterize these properties, suggestions are
   provided to stimulate the use of readily available and sometimes
   underutilized pharmaceutical polymers in additive manufacturing. We
   point to emerging characterization techniques and digital tools, which
   can be harnessed to manage existing trade-offs between the role of
   polymers in printer compatibility versus product performance. In a
   rapidly evolving technological space, this serves to trigger the
   continued development of 3D printers to suit a broader variety of
   polymers for widespread applications of pharmaceutical additive
   manufacturing. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is

Title = {A scalable parallel finite element framework for growing geometries.
   Application to metal additive manufacturing},

Abstract = {This work introduces an innovative parallel fully-distributed finite
   element framework for growing geometries and its application to metal
   additive manufacturing. It is well known that virtual part design and
   qualification in additive manufacturing requires highly accurate
   multiscale and multiphysics analyses. Only high performance computing
   tools are able to handle such complexity in time frames compatible with
   time-to-market. However, efficiency, without loss of accuracy, has
   rarely held the centre stage in the numerical community. Here, in
   contrast, the framework is designed to adequately exploit the resources
   of high-end distributed-memory machines. It is grounded on three
   building blocks: (1) hierarchical adaptive mesh refinement with
   octree-based meshes; (2) a parallel strategy to model the growth of the
   geometry; and (3) state-of-the-art parallel iterative linear solvers.
   Computational experiments consider the heat transfer analysis at the
   part scale of the printing process by powder-bed technologies. After
   verification against a three-dimensional (3D) benchmark, a
   strong-scaling analysis assesses performance and identifies major
   sources of parallel overhead. A third numerical example examines the
   efficiency and robustness of (2) in a curved 3D shape. Unprecedented
   parallelism and scalability were achieved in this work. Hence, this
   framework contributes to take on higher complexity and/or accuracy, not
   only of part-scale simulations of metal or polymer additive
   manufacturing but also in welding, sedimentation, atherosclerosis, or
   any other physical problem where the physical domain of interest grows
   in time.},

Title = {Additive manufacturing enables personalised porous high-density
   polyethylene surgical implant manufacturing with improved tissue and
   vascular ingrowth},
Journal = {APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {22},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Porous high-density polyethylene (pHDPE) surgical implants have played a
   significant role in aesthetic, reconstructive and skeletal augmentation
   procedures for more than 30 years and have been the gold-standard
   synthetic implant used in more than 400,000 procedures worldwide. The
   effects of pHDPE implant properties such as porosity, geometry and
   surface chemistry are crucial considerations. Additive manufacturing and
   plasma surface treatment are promising approaches to induce rapid tissue
   integration and vascularisation, improve healing times and lead to more
   satisfactory patient outcomes. Here, a novel pHDPE scaffold architecture
   obtained by laser sintering was characterised to quantify porosity
   variations as a result of manufacturing, compared to scaffolds
   manufactured via traditional moulding, laser sintering, and the clinical
   gold-standard surgical implant, MEDPOR (R). Plasma surface treatment was
   also explored as a means of improving the hydrophilicity of the HDPE. An
   in vitro cell culture study examined the attachment of cells on treated
   and non-treated scaffolds. After 3 days, plasma-treated scaffolds
   exhibited a 1.6-fold increase in cell attachment compared to
   non-treated, hydrophobic samples. Plasmatreated and non-treated samples
   were then implanted subcutaneously in rats for 1, 4, and 8 weeks to
   assess biocompatibility, tissue ingrowth and vascularisation.
   Histological analysis revealed that laser sintered StarPore (R)
   scaffolds exhibited significantly higher tissue ingrowth compared to the
   moulded scaffolds, whilst fibrous encapsulation dominated the tissue
   response in moulded StarPore (R) scaffolds. Plasma treatment did not
   significantly affect the quantity of tissue ingrowth, however it
   significantly increased the density of blood vessels within sintered
   StarPore (R) scaffolds by an average of 86.6\%. Overall, this study
   demonstrated that novel manufacturing and plasma treatment of pHDPE
   surgical implants enhanced cell attachment in vitro and increased blood
   vessel density in laser sintered StarPore (R) scaffolds in vivo. (C)

Title = {Additive manufacturing for sustainability and circular economy: needs,
   challenges, and opportunities for 3D printing of recycled polymeric
   waste},
Journal = {MATERIALS TODAY SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Polymer-based product usage rapidly increases globally, leading to
   severe ecological, social, environmental, health, and economic impacts.
   There has been an international push for solutions to sustainable
   production, consumption, and end-of-life for plastics to combat these
   issues. Moreover, additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing (3DP)
   processes provide rapid fabrication of functional parts in lesser time,
   lower lead times, and lower research and development costs. Due to these
   reasons, these processes are now being utilized in different industrial
   sectors, including aerospace, automotive, biomedical, sports, food,
   electronics, and construction. The circular economy concept integrated
   with AM processes can deliver a synergic impact and a new life to
   discarded polymeric parts with distributed recycling and manufacturing.
   With the development and adoption of the proper techniques, AM can be
   used widely to reuse polymer wastes to turn them into valuable products.
   It can lead to much higher levels of reuse at very low cost and for
   targeted applications. Therefore, in this study, a comprehensive
   literature review is performed to outline guidelines and a circular
   economy model for AM of recycled polymers based on the reviewed
   literature. This study delivers insight into; different commodity
   polymers and their uses, challenges in polymer recycling, polymer
   recycling approaches, and a circular economy model for AM of recycled
   polymers. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an

   and testing of polymer-textile composites using polylactic acid (PLA)
   filaments on synthetic mesh fabrics using direct material extrusion
   (ME). An aspect of this paper highlights the appropriate combination of
   printing material, textile substrate, and printer settings to achieve
   excellent polymer-textile adhesion. Details of the printing process to
   create polymer-textile composites are described, as are the interfacial
   strength results of the T-peel tests, and the observed failure modes
   post-testing. The peel strengths for different ME bonded polymer-textile
   composites are examined and used to identify the compatibility of
   materials. This work visualised the potential of direct ME of polymers
   onto textile fabrics as a material-joining approach for new textile
   functionalisation, multi-material composite explorations and innovative
   aesthetic print techniques. This work also adds to the limited knowledge
   of AM polymer-textile composites, which can provide helpful information
   for designers and researchers to develop new applications and facilitate
   future research development in smart embedded and programmable textiles.},

Title = {Damage tolerance-based methodology for fatigue lifetime estimation of a
   structural component produced by material extrusion-based additive
   manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {36},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {While additive manufacturing of polymers, especially material
   extrusion-based methods such as fused filament fabrication, has become
   increasingly popular for design studies, rapid prototyping and the
   production of noncritical spare parts, its application in structurally
   loaded components is still scarce. One of the reasons for this might be
   scepticism of engineers due to the lack of knowledge regarding the
   expected lifetime and reliability of these components under stress.
   Therefore, it is necessary to find fast, easy and reliable ways to
   determine the expected lifetime of a component without the need to apply
   expensive full-scale component testing for every new part. To realise
   this, finite element analysis combined with fracture mechanical lifetime
   calculations can be applied. In this paper, crack growth kinetics of the
   commonly used material poly(lactic acid) have been utilised to estimate
   the lifetime of a component under complex loading conditions, namely
   fatigue and friction. The calculated lifetime, based on a damage
   tolerant fracture mechanics approach, was found to be in good agreement
   to the results of full-scale component tests, proving the applicability
   of the chosen approach. Applying this knowledge can vastly decrease the
   necessary time during component design and encourage the additive
   manufacturing community towards applying their components also in
   structurally loaded applications.},

Title = {Embedded Optical Fibre with Fibre Bragg Grating Influence on Additive
   Manufactured Polymeric Structure Durability},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) polymers are applied in many branches of the
   industry due to the possibility of fast and accurate production of
   elements with various and complex shapes. Fibre Bragg grating sensors
   (FBG) are widely applied in structural health monitoring (SHM) systems.
   The main objective of this research is to perform analyses of the
   influence of embedded FBG sensors on AM polymer elements' durability.
   Two polymers (M3 X and M3 Crystal) with different mechanical properties
   were analysed. The tests were performed on samples with FBG sensors
   embedded in (different alignment) and attached to the surfaces of the
   elements. Firstly, the samples were exposed to elevated or sub-zero
   temperatures under stable relative humidity levels. The strain in the
   samples was measured using fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. The
   achieved results allow us to determine the relationships between strain
   and temperature for both materials and the differences in their
   mechanical response to the thermal loading. Then, the samples were
   subjected to a tensile test. A comparison of the tensile strength values
   was performed for the samples without and with embedded FBG sensors. The
   samples after the tensile tests were compared, showing differences in
   the mechanisms of failures related to the polymers and the thermal
   treatment influence on the material internal structure. Additionally,
   strain values measured by the FBG sensors were compared to the strain
   values achieved from the testing machine showing a good agreement
   (especially for M3 X) and indicating the differences in the materials'
   mechanical properties. The achieved results allow us to conclude there
   is a lack of influence of embedded FBG sensors on the mechanical
   durability of AM polymers.},

   manufacturing of complex parts using 3D-printed polymer molds},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 13},
Abstract = {The solid-state additive manufacturing (AM) process cold spraying (CS)
   offers advantageous properties such as melt-free near-net-shape part
   fabrication and high deposition rates. Compared to other metal-based AM
   processes such as the powder bed fusion of metals (PBF-LB/M) or directed
   energy deposition (DED) processes such as laser metal deposition
   (DED-LB), CS features lower part resolution. One solution to increase
   the achievable level of detail is spraying onto removable molds. No
   study exists that investigates the general feasibility and manufacturing
   boundaries, from which design guidelines could be derived. In this
   paper, the applicability of material extruded and thermally bonded
   polymer (MEX-TRB/P) shapes, which is especially suitable for flexible
   low-cost production of small batches, as molds for cold spray additive
   manufacturing (CSAM) is investigated. For this purpose, material
   extruded thermoplastics are examined regarding their suitability for the
   CS process. Furthermore, geometrical and thus constructive restrictions
   of this new approach ``Cold Spray Forming{''} (CSF) are analyzed using
   an industry-relevant use case. It was shown that the feasibility of this
   approach could be determined by the material value hardness of the
   sprayed polymer substrates.},

   amorphous plastic parts: The effects of extrusion nozzle diameter and
   layer height},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {51},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Material extrusion is an efficient additive manufacturing process for
   thermoplastic materials in the field of rapid prototyping, rapid
   tooling, rapid manufacturing and rapid repair. Parts to be additive
   manufactured of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS Terluran GP 35)
   with mechanical properties close to the data sheet specification of
   injection molded parts are in the focus of this study. An in-house
   process chain from the plastic pellets to the finished additive
   manufactured product is developed to monitor and to define the process
   parameters for each individual processing step using the terpolymer. By
   varying the parameters extrusion nozzle diameter and layer height, the
   production-related internal part structure and the surface topography of
   the additive manufactured tensile test specimens are improved in such a
   way that the mechanical property yield strength rises from 55\% to 75\%
   of the data sheet specification for injection molded ABS parts. The
   elongation at break increases from 42\% up to 70\% of the specified
   data. The smallest extrusion nozzle diameter in connection with the
   smallest layer height provide the densest internal part structure, the
   lowest surface roughness and the best mechanical properties. Especially
   the ductility was controlled by the manufacturing parameters since the
   number of pores introduced in the internal part structure determine the
   number of crazes. Apart from ductility, even with low layer height but
   larger extrusion nozzle diameter, the resistance to failure of the
   material extrusion manufactured parts improves significantly and saves
   manufacturing time by a factor of 10.},

Title = {Comparing environmental impacts of additive manufacturing vs traditional
   machining via life-cycle assessment},
Journal = {RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Pages = {14-33},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this study is to compare the environmental
   impacts of two additive manufacturing machines to a traditional computer
   numerical control (CNC) milling machine to determine which method is the
   most sustainable.
   Design/methodology/approach - A life-cycle assessment (LCA) was
   performed, comparing a Haas VF0 CNC mill to two methods of additive
   manufacturing: a Dimension 1200BST FDM and an Objet Connex 350
   ``inkjet{''}/{''}polyjet{''}. The LCA's functional unit was the
   manufacturing of two specific parts in acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
   (ABS) plastic or similar polymer, as required by the machines. The scope
   was cradle to grave, including embodied impacts, transportation, energy
   used during manufacturing, energy used while idling and in standby,
   material used in final parts, waste material generated, cutting fluid
   for CNC, and disposal. Several scenarios were considered, all scored
   using the ReCiPe Endpoint H and IMPACT 2002+ methodologies.
   Findings - Results showed that the sustainability of additive
   manufacturing vs CNC machining depends primarily on the per cent
   utilization of each machine. Higher utilization both reduces idling
   energy use and amortizes the embodied impacts of each machine. For both
   three-dimensional (3D) printers, electricity use is always the dominant
   impact, but for CNC at maximum utilization, material waste became
   dominant, and cutting fluid was roughly on par with electricity use. At
   both high and low utilization, the fused deposition modeling (FDM)
   machine had the lowest ecological impacts per part. The inkjet machine
   sometimes performed better and sometimes worse than CNC, depending on
   idle time/energy and on process parameters.
   Research limitations/implications - The study only compared additive
   manufacturing in plastic, and did not include other additive
   manufacturing technologies, such as selective laser sintering or
   stereolithography. It also does not include post-processing that might
   bring the surface finish of FDM parts up to the quality of inkjet or CNC
   parts.
   Practical implications - Designers and engineers seeking to minimize the
   environmental impacts of their prototypes should share high-utilization
   machines, and are advised to use FDM machines over CNC mills or polyjet
   machines if they provide sufficient quality of surface finish.
   Originality/value - This is the first paper quantitatively comparing the
   environmental impacts of additive manufacturing with traditional
   machining. It also provides a more comprehensive measurement of
   environmental impacts than most studies of either milling or additive
   manufacturing alone it includes not merely CO2 emissions or waste but
   also acidification, eutrophication, human toxicity, ecotoxicity and
   other impact categories. Designers, engineers and job shop managers may
   use the results to guide sourcing or purchasing decisions related to
   rapid prototyping.},

Title = {Print fidelity metrics for additive manufacturing of cement-based
   materials},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {55},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Additively manufactured cement-based structures for infrastructure
   applications suffer from in-construction shape deformations, which are a
   strong function of process conditions and the rheology of the printing
   material (cement paste, mortar, or concrete). Thus, characterization of
   the shape of such manufactured objects is critical to establish and
   ensure fidelity to the original CAD model. In this study, a number of
   quantitative metrics were used to compare the dimensional and shape
   accuracy of laboratory-scale printed cement-based objects. A new method
   is described that uses the axes of minimum moment of inertia and the
   centroid as the basis for aligning and comparing objects. X-ray computed
   tomography (XCT) data was used to characterize both internal and
   external features. Details of the logic and image processing
   requirements are given and typical sample irregularities that lead to
   quantification of uncertainty are illustrated. The effect of sampling
   statistics on metric confidence was studied and guidelines are provided
   for good sampling protocols. The results show the extent to which
   different penalty logics provide sensitivity for the detection of
   specific types of flaws. Furthermore, when the minimum moment of inertia
   is used as the basis for alignment and comparison, a high correlation is
   found between boundary-based and volume-based fidelity metrics. Such
   quantitative printability metrics are necessary to establish a basis for
   evaluating the repeatable shape fidelity of 3D-printed objects and for
   quantitatively studying how rheology affects both the manufacturing
   process and the final built part. The method is illustrated for
   benchmark printed objects fabricated using three hydrogel forming
   polymers as printing aids.},

Title = {A rapid development workflow for binder inks for additive manufacturing
   with application to polymer and reactive binder ink formulation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {73},

Abstract = {Binder jet additive manufacturing (BJAM) enables processing of metals,
   ceramics, polymers and composites through the deposition of a binding
   agent onto a powder bed in a layer-by-layer sequence. Most commonly, a
   polymer binder is utilized to provide temporary strength to the printed
   component enabling part removal and handling from the printer; however,
   it is challenging to manage distortion and shrinkage during sintering.
   Reactive binders, which create solid interparticle bridges upon
   decomposition, provide additional benefit beyond temporary green
   strength and can lead to enhanced densification kinetics, control of
   warping and shrinkage, and tailoring of local composition. This paper
   presents a process for the development of custom binder inks which
   includes exploration of binder ink rheology, wetting and infiltration
   interactions between the binder ink and powder, ink jetting and the
   effect of drop spacing on line formation, thermal decomposition of the
   binder, and evaluation of green strength using indentation. The binder
   ink development process is applied to the synthesis of custom polymer
   and reactive (metal salt) binder inks, showcasing the capability to
   control jetting behavior through rheological modifications and the
   favorable comparability of wetting, infiltration, and green strength of
   the reactive binders to the studied polymer binders. The viscosity and
   surface tension of the binder inks vary by 10 cP and 35 mN/m,
   respectively, with successful jetting and powder binding achieved by
   polymer and metal salt binder inks, with green strengths measured
   between 2 and 18 MPa. Through our presented process, rapid sampling of
   binders can be performed and through the implementation of reactive
   binders into BJAM in the future, a powerful tool for control of
   densification and warping is identified.},

Title = {Additive manufacturing of inductive force sensor with NiZn-ferrite
   magnetic core for robotic gripper},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {71},
Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is an innovative technology that overcomes
   the technical limitations of traditional ceramic manufacturing methods.
   AM offers unprecedented opportunities for the development of
   ceramic-based electronics with complex 3D structures, which can be
   imparted with electronic functionalities. In this study, inductive force
   sensors composed of a ceramic-based magnetic core and polymer-based
   helical spring were fabricated using various AM technologies. To ensure
   reasonable force-sensing performance, the response to the external force
   was controlled by controlling the spring constant of the helical spring
   and measured according to the change in inductance of the magnetic
   sensing circuit implemented in the sensor. The fully additive
   manu-factured (AMed) inductive force sensors exhibited outstanding
   sensing performance: they achieved a sensitivity of 0.139 mu H/N with
   good repeatability, high linearity (99.01\%), negligible hysteresis
   (less than 0.01 mu H), and robust cyclic endurance. The sensor
   performance was further validated by building and testing a robotic
   gripper that employed an AMed inductive force sensor. This study offers
   an innovative way to manufacture a variety of sensors with complex
   shapes that can fit into dummy spaces allowed by the design of
   electronic devices, which will contribute to the effective integration
   of various electronic components in future electronic systems, such as
   robots.},

Abstract = {Carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) are advanced engineering
   materials which are recognized as the most sought-after composite for
   several industrial applications including aerospace and automotive
   sectors. CFRP have superior physical and mechanical properties such as
   lightweight, high resilience, high-durability and high
   strength-to-weight ratio. CFRP composites stacked up with titanium to
   form multi-layered material stacks to enhance its load bearing
   capability. Traditional methods of stacking up CFRP and titanium
   involves using either high strength adhesives or rivets and bolts. The
   laminate structures joined by these methods often tend to fail during
   high load-bearing applications. Conventional metal welding technologies
   use high heat causing high thermal stresses and microstructural damages.
   Ultrasonic welding is a solid-state joining process, which has the
   capability of welding dissimilar materials at relatively low
   temperatures using ultrasonic vibration. Ultrasonic additive
   manufacturing (UAM) process is an ideal method to weld CFRP and
   Titanium. During the ultrasonic welding process, two dissimilar
   materials under a continuous static load are subjected to transverse
   ultrasonic vibrations, which results in high stress and friction between
   the two surfaces. This research focuses on the study of ultrasonically
   welding CFRP and Titanium stacks using UAM process. The study involves
   experimentation performed on an in-house built UAM setup. Finite element
   analysis is performed to understand the distribution stresses and
   strains during the UAM process. In this study, CFRP and Titanium layers
   are successfully welded using UAM process without causing any melting or
   significant heating. The finite element analysis study revealed that
   during UAM process, CFRP/Titanium stacks are subject to repeated cyclic
   shear stress reversals resulting in a strong weld joint. The
   stress-strain diagram during the process showed a considerable increase
   in plastic strain during the UAM process. The outcomes of this study can
   be used to further the industrial applications of the ultrasonic
   additive process as well as other ultrasonic welding based processes
   involving dissimilar materials.},

Title = {Highly Tunable Thiol-Ene Photoresins for Volumetric Additive
   Manufacturing},
Journal = {ADVANCED MATERIALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Number = {47},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Volumetric additive manufacturing (VAM) forms complete 3D objects in a
   single photocuring operation without layering defects, enabling 3D
   printed polymer parts with mechanical properties similar to their bulk
   material counterparts. This study presents the first report of
   VAM-printed thiol-ene resins. With well-ordered molecular networks,
   thiol-ene chemistry accesses polymer materials with a wide range of
   mechanical properties, moving VAM beyond the limitations of commonly
   used acrylate formulations. Since free-radical thiol-ene polymerization
   is not inhibited by oxygen, the nonlinear threshold response required in
   VAM is introduced by incorporating 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy
   (TEMPO) as a radical scavenger. Tuning of the reaction kinetics is
   accomplished by balancing inhibitor and initiator content. Coupling this
   with quantitative measurements of the absorbed volumetric optical dose
   allows control of polymer conversion and gelation during printing.
   Importantly, this work thereby establishes the first comprehensive
   framework for spatial-temporal control over volumetric energy
   distribution, demonstrating structures 3D printed in thiol-ene resin by
   means of tomographic volumetric VAM. Mechanical characterization of this
   thiol-ene system, with varied ratios of isocyanurate and triethylene
   glycol monomers, reveals highly tunable mechanical response far more
   versatile than identical acrylate-based resins. This broadens the range
   of materials and properties available for VAM, taking another step
   toward high-performance printed polymers.},

Abstract = {It is a known fact that most thermoset resins are very sensitive to hot
   temperature, which hinders its ability to produce polymer-based products
   in a large scale. This study aims to investigate the potential of
   manufacturing polymer concrete in ambient room temperature of 30 +/- 2
   degrees C. A laboratory test was conducted with the introduction of
   polyester retarder additive into polyester resin formulation. All tests
   were carried out strictly in ambient room temperature (30 +/- 2 degrees
   C). For comparison purpose, polyester resin without retarder additive
   was prepared as the control formulation under identical condition.
   Visual inspection was done on the fresh working life of polyester resin
   with 0\%, 0.1\%, 0.15\%, and 0.2\% of retarder additive in two different
   types of polyester resin-isophthalic and orthophthalic. Characterization
   on retarder additive was conducted under X-ray Diffraction (XRD),
   Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and, H-1 and C-13 Nuclear
   Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Investigation on the effects of polymer
   retarder additive on the physical and mechanical properties of polymer
   resin, polymer blended, and polymer concrete showed that the retarder
   additive had prolonged the working life and improved properties of
   polymer concrete. These proved the potential of adding retarder additive
   in polymer concrete in ambient room temperature of 30 +/- 2 degrees C.

Abstract = {The paper presents how a robotic gripper specific for grasping and
   handling of textiles and soft flexible layers can be miniaturized and
   improved by polymeric additive manufacturing-oriented re-design.
   Advantages of polymeric additive manufacturing are to allow a re-design
   of components with integrated functions, to be cost-effective equipment
   for small batches production and the availability of suitable materials
   for many applications. The drawback is that for design validation
   extended testing is still necessary because of lacks in standardization
   and that the mechanical properties are building parameters dependent.
   The outcomes are a lower complexity of the design overall and lower
   number of components. These are pursued taking advantage of the
   anisotropy of the additive manufacturing processed polymer and assigning
   appropriate shapes and linkages in the mechanisms. Set of common
   materials (polylactide, polyethylene terephthalate, acrylonitrile
   butadiene styrene) and technical (acrylonitrile styrene acrylate,
   polycarbonate/polybutylene terephthalate blend) are tested to obtain
   data for the modelling.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the use of polymer additive manufacturing technology,
   also called 3D printing, for imparting texture to bond regions in
   adhesively bonded joints is explored. An improvement in the apparent
   shear strength values of adhesively bonded single lap joints is achieved
   by fusing structural reinforcements to the adherents through fused
   deposition modeling (FDM) additive technique. Towards that,
   computational models were first developed to simulate stress
   distribution along the overlap region of single lap shear joints, and
   four models that performed the best were chosen for physical testing.
   Pure adhesive (PA) joints were manufactured first, followed by the
   fabrication of 3D-printed adhesive (3D-PA) joints. Peak loads, shear
   stresses, and failure types were compared between these models. PA
   joints failed mainly adhesively, resulting in low peak loads and shear
   strength, whereas, 3D-PA joints registered higher average peak loads and
   shear strengths (increased by up to approximate to 832 \%) with
   predominantly cohesive failure. 3D printed reinforcements appear to have
   imparted higher shear resistance against failure at the bond regions.
   Overall, using a combined computational and experimental approach, it is
   established that the 3D printed reinforcements have the potential to
   drastically improve the apparent shear strength of adhesively bonded
   single lap joints. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In an effort to simplify power electronics integration, we explored an
   additive manufacturing (AM) process, or commonly known as
   three-dimensional (3D) printing for fabricating magnetic components. A
   commercial multi-extruder paste-extrusion 3D printer was used to process
   both metal and magnetic pastes into 3D structures. We formulated a
   low-temperature curable Poly-Mag paste, which is a mixture of magnetic
   powder and a polymer, as a feed material for printing the magnetic core
   and used a commercial nanosilver paste for printing the winding. After
   the structure was printed, it was cured at 250 degrees C for one hour
   without any external pressure to form the magnetic component. The
   nanosilver paste can achieve a crack-free single layer thicker than 100
   mu m and the electrical resistivity of the printed winding was about
   three times higher than that of bulk silver. This is because of the low
   curing temperature resulted in a lower density than the bulk. The
   relative permeability dispersion of the 3D printed toroid core had a
   bandwidth up to 10 MHz with a static relative permeability of about 10.
   Both the winding and core magnetic properties will be improved by
   adjusting the feed paste formulations and their flow characteristics and
   fine-tuning the printer parameters, such as motor speeds, extrusion
   rate, and nozzle sizes.},

Month = {JUN 4},
Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this research is to design 3D print and analyze
   mechanical as well as microstructural behavior of interlaced fibrous
   structures using Dremel 3D45 additive manufacturing (AM) machine.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A series of plain and twill weave fabrics are designed using
   computer-aided design software Solidworks and printed using fused
   deposition modeling machines to determine the best model that could be
   printable. The structures were designed in such a way that the
   fabricated yarns with pure (PLA) were not sticking to each other in the
   fabric structure. The specimens were printed in vertical orientation and
   then tensile and three-point bending (flexural) tests were conducted for
   twill weave fabrics.
   Findings
   The tests showed that the mechanical strength was higher in the warp
   direction than in the weft direction. This difference was because of
   printing of continuous filament-like yarns in the warp direction and
   staple-like yarns in the weft direction. This orthotropic property of
   the material was verified by analyzing its microscopic structures via
   optical microscope.
   Research limitations/implications
   Future work should include improvement of the structure and exploration
   of different polymers and their composites to increase the tensile,
   bending and other strengths to make the 3D-printed structures more
   flexible and stronger. Future research should also focus on the
   large-scale manufacturing of 3D printed fabrics.
   Practical implications
   This paper supports work on wearable 3D-printed fabrics. The 3D-printed
   fabric will also contribute to new applications and products such as
   liquid filters.
   Originality/value
   The research done in this work is new and original. This paper
   contributes to new knowledge by providing a better understanding of
   polymers and their 3D printing capabilities to form a complex fabric
   structure.},

Abstract = {Metal additive-manufacturing technologies enable the production of
   complex geometries. However, high manufacturing costs hinder these
   technologies being employed in some industries. In this sense, a hybrid
   strategy is presented in this paper, to achieve the best of additive and
   subtractive technologies, offering economic advantages. AlSi10Mg
   aluminium powder was deposited on AW-6082 pre-machined substrates and
   mechanical and thermal properties of these specimens were evaluated
   considering the application of a stress relief heat treatment. The
   results were especially good in the compressive mechanical properties
   and in the thermal properties: compressive properties were improved by
   up to 27\%, and the specific heat capacity and coefficient of thermal
   expansion were reduced by up to 38\%, compared to additively
   manufactured AlSi10Mg. Therefore, hybrid manufacturing can be a
   profitable solution (i) in thermal management applications, (ii) when
   compressive loads are presented, or (iii) to repair damaged parts,
   providing a circular economy, as presented in a case study of this
   paper.},

Abstract = {Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a high-performance plastic with favorable
   physical, mechanical, chemical, and biological properties for various
   industrial applications. Most PEEK substrates/components are
   manufactured using traditional methods like milling, compression
   molding, injection molding, pressure sintering, and so forth. With the
   advent of various additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, researchers
   have been working on optimizing the processing parameters for AM of
   PEEK. Furthermore, several PEEK composites with improved properties have
   also been developed, and efforts have also been made to use these PEEK
   composites in AM. Since AM of PEEK and its composites is a relatively
   new area of the advanced manufacturing process, the field faces many
   challenges. There is a dearth of comprehensive reports on this topic.
   Keeping this perspective in mind, we have tried to collate the relevant
   information on the composites and AM of PEEK in this review. The review
   highlighted the influence of variation in composition on material
   properties and performance of PEEK and showed the correlation with AM
   processability of such composites. A detailed analysis of the various
   reports on fused deposition modeling and selective laser sintering based
   processing of PEEK composites is included in the review. Critical
   barriers to the AM of these high-performance polymer composites are
   pointed out. We have also included the outcome of some interesting
   studies about the coating of PEEK with various materials/compounds to
   provide a broader perspective. This review will help the researcher to
   design and develop additively manufactured PEEK-based structures with
   improved and customized properties.},

Abstract = {Rapid prototyping (RP) or layered manufacturing (LM) technologies have
   been extensively used to manufacture prototypes composed mainly of
   plastics, polymers, paper, and wax due to the short product development
   time and low costs of these technologies. However, such technologies,
   with the exception of selective laser melting and sintering, are not
   used to fabricate metallic products because of the resulting poor life,
   short cycle, poor surface finish, and low structural integrity of the
   fabricated parts. The properties endowed by these parts do not match
   those of functional parts. Therefore, extensive research has been
   conducted to develop new additive manufacturing (AM) technologies by
   extending existing RP technologies. Several AM technologies have been
   developed for the fabrication of metallic objects. These technologies
   utilize materials, such as Ni-, Al-, and Ti-based alloys and stainless
   steel powders, to fabricate high-quality functional components. The
   present work reviews the type of materials used in laser-based AM
   processes for the manufacture of metallic products. The advantages and
   disadvantages of processes and different materials are summarized, and
   future research directions are discussed in the final section. This
   review can help experts select the ideal type of process or technology
   for the manufacturing of elements composed of a given alloy or material
   (Ni, Ti, Al, Pb, and stainless steel).},

   panels with load-bearing and acoustic capabilities for aerospace
   applications},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {61},

Abstract = {Reducing the noise produced by airplane engines is a significant
   challenge for the aerospace industry. In the present work, we
   investigate the design and fabrication of an acoustic sandwich panel
   featuring wider soundabsorbing performance compared to the currently
   employed technologies (e.g., perforated honeycomb cell sandwich panels).
   The use of material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEAM) enables us
   to create panels in one manufacturing step with complex geometry. The
   developed multifunctional (i.e., mechanical and acoustic) sandwich
   panel, which is based on the combination of five Helmholtz resonators,
   demonstrates an absorption spectrum over 517 Hz when measured with an
   impedance tube. The developed acoustic design, named Trapezoidal Compact
   (TC) sandwich, has an acoustic spectrum with more than 90\% of
   absorption, comprised between 643 Hz and 1160 Hz. Three-point bending
   tests revealed that the stiffness of the sandwich panels with the TC
   geometry is up to similar to 10\% higher than those of the panels with a
   standard hexagonal honeycomb (HC) structure, additively manufactured
   with the same mass and wall thickness. The design developed in this work
   will contribute to the improvement of additive manufacturing process of
   multifunctional structures for aerospace applications.},

Abstract = {Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is one of the state-of-art and most
   popular extrusion-based additive manufacturing technology. This
   technology is popular due to its affordability, simple design, and
   compact size. In FFF technology, a wire form polymer material called
   filament is pushed inside a heated chamber using an extruder motor and
   teethed wheel. In a heated chamber, this filament is converted into
   semi-solid form and extruded out of the nozzle to fabricate the part.
   Producing the wire from raw polymer increases the cost as well as limits
   the used material up to such polymers, which could form a thin and long,
   continuous, and uniform wire with certain rigidity and other mechanical
   properties. Hence, the use of filament increases the cost of FFF
   technology and available wire-based 3D printers are limited by their
   material availability in the form of wire. These limitations could be
   eliminated by using a screw-based extrusion mechanism, in which feed
   materials would be used in pellets or granules form. Since studies on
   the development of commercial 3D printers based on pellets/granules
   extrusion were usually neglected Hence, in this study initial efforts
   have been made to design and develop a pellets/granules-extruder, which
   does accept a wide range of materials that are generally available in
   the market for conventional manufacturing processes. Further, flexible
   materials and the material which can't be converted into filament could
   also be used as feed material in the form of pellets/granules by using
   the developed system to fabricate a part for different industrial
   applications.},

Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {As a first step of applying additive manufacturing (AM) technology,
   plastic prototypes have been produced using various AM Process such as
   Fusion Deposition Modeling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA) and other
   processes. After more research and development, AM has become capable of
   producing complex net shaped in materials which can be used in
   applicable parts. These materials include metals, ceramics, and
   composites. Polymers and metals are considered as commercially available
   materials for AM processes; however, ceramics and composites are still
   considered under research and development. In this study, a literature
   review on design for AM of composite materials and potential alloys is
   discussed. It is investigated that polymer matrix, ceramic matrix, metal
   matrix, and fiber reinforced are most common composites through AM.
   Furthermore, Functionally Graded Materials (FGM) is considered as an
   effective application of AM because AM offers the ability to control the
   composition and optimize the properties of the built part. An example of
   FGM through using AM technology is the missile nose cone which includes
   an ultra-high temperature ceramic graded to a refractory metal from
   outside to inside and it used for sustaining extreme external
   temperatures. During this work, different applications of AM on
   different classifications of composite materials are shown through
   studying of industrial objective, the importance of application,
   processing, results and future challenges.},

Abstract = {Ceramic additive manufacturing (AM) typically uses a high fraction of
   organic binders to form pre-sintered green parts that require a post
   de-binding process to remove. The de-binding process inevitably results
   in severe gas expansion and residual chars, leading to structural
   defects, accumulated stress, and compromised material properties in the
   final parts. Here we report a binder-free additive manufacturing process
   named hydrothermal-assisted jet fusion (HJF) that utilizes a
   hydrothermal method to create geometrically and compositionally complex
   ceramics under mild temperatures. The HJF process employs a selectively
   deposited volatile dissolving ink, high pressure, and mild heat to
   strategically fuse a ceramic powder bed into complex geometries.
   Compared to traditional AM methods for ceramics, the HJF process
   eliminates the need for organic binders in green part fabrication and
   offers the potential to directly co-print ceramics with other dissimilar
   materials, such as polymers and metals, enabling the development of
   novel multi-functional ceramic composites.},

Title = {Using fillers to tune material properties of an ion-containing
   semi-crystalline poly(ethylene glycol) for fused filament fabrication
   additive manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {39},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The materials library for Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) additive
   manufacturing processes has been primarily dominated by amorphous
   thermoplastic materials. Semi-crystalline polymers form tough plastics
   due to their strong intermolecular forces, which makes them well suited
   for applications requiring wear and chemical resistance, thermal
   stability, and structural loading. However, they are infrequently used
   in FFF because of large shrinkage that occurs due to recrystallization
   during cooling, which causes printed layers to warp. The authors have
   previously evaluated a semi-crystalline polymer series (sulfonated
   poly(ethylene glycol) (SPEG)) for FFF printability. The influence of
   divalent counter-ions in the SPEG series altered the material properties
   and crystallization to enable processing via FFF. The SPEG containing a
   calcium counterion resulted in the print quality due to the higher
   viscosity (10(5) Pa.s) allowing the material to hold shape in the melt
   and high-nucleation and small spherulite size mitigating the layer
   warping. However, the dialysis used for the ion exchange in the polymer
   synthesis procedure proved challenging for mass manufacturing scale-up.
   To circumvent this limitation, the authors explore the incorporation of
   ionically charged filler materials in the SPEG with a sodium
   counter-ion, poly(PEG8k-co-NaSIP), to achieve the desired properties for
   FFF processing. Both ionic (calcium chloride and calcium carbonate) and
   non-ionic (silica and starch) filler particles were added to
   poly(PEG8k-co-NaSIP) and the resulting material properties and effect on
   FFF printability were measured. The calcium chloride filler changed the
   viscosity, crystallinity, spherulite growth, and spherulite size which
   improved the processing via FFF without requiring an ion exchange. This
   technique may be applicable to other ionic polymers in order to alter
   their material properties to enable FFF printing.},

Abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) is a term used to group the different
   manufacturing processes that use various techniques, each of which is
   capable of producing parts made from a wide variety of materials, such
   as polymers, ceramics, metals, wood, among others. All these
   technologies allow parts manufacturing by adding successive layers of
   material which can be liquid, powder or wire. In order to take
   advantages of the geometric freedom offered by AM, Topological
   Optimization (TO) is usually used. TO provides the optimal distribution
   of material for a given request. The main objective is weight reduction,
   without compromising the original resistance of an existing part
   produced by traditional processes. Taking advantage of the freedom
   allowed by the AM process and conciliating it with the CAE features,
   which allow to simulate the parts behavior when subjected to the
   expected loads, a new approach methodology was drawn in order to shorten
   the time needed to optimize parts design for AM. A case study was
   developed in order to validate the methodology established. The
   combination of AM and TO revealed promising results, attending to the
   component efficiency achieved. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing represents a powerful tool for the fabrication of
   parts with complex shapes by the deposition and the consolidation of
   materials as opposed to subtractive manufacturing methodology. Selective
   laser sintering (SLS), one of the most popular powder bed fusion (PBF)
   technologies for thermoplastic part production, has demonstrated
   extensive applications in various industrial sectors. The process
   involves the deposition of homogeneous powder layers and employs a laser
   source to selectively melt a powder bed according to a CAD model. Due to
   its layer-by-layer nature, voids and pores are inevitably introduced in
   the fabricated thermoplastic parts. Porosity represents one of the major
   limitations of this technology being one of the main causes of the
   variation of the mechanical properties. With the intention of providing
   support for reducing the porosity and thus increasing the quality and
   performance of the final product, in this paper, a brief review was
   carried out focusing on the SLS process parameters and their interaction
   with the porosity of the product. In addition, an in-depth look was
   given to the mechanisms of formation and consolidation of pores within
   parts made of polymeric material.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the redesign and additive
   manufacturing of a rocket engine nozzle using Inconel 625 material. The
   redesigned engine took into consideration material shrinkage during the
   metal transfer process. The additive manufacturing process was carried
   out using the appropriate toolpaths to form a solid structure.
   Micrographs of the additively manufactured structure showed layer
   resolution and fine detail, as well as the presence of metallic
   particles within the polymer matrix. The final rocket engine nozzle
   produced was found to have the necessary mechanical and metallurgical
   properties required for practical use in future space vehicle
   operations. This was demonstrated by tensile tests carried out at
   various temperatures and 3D white light interferometry scans of the
   surface properties. The results of the study suggest that additive
   manufacturing and Inconel 625 material can be used to produce
   high-performance rocket engine nozzles that meet the requirements of the
   aerospace industry. This study provides valuable insights into the
   potential applications of additive manufacturing in the aerospace
   industry and may lead to the development of new, high-performance rocket
   engine nozzles.},

Abstract = {This article is aimed at extending the `mortise-and-tenon' joining
   concept commonly utilized in corner or tee joints to lap joints in which
   one sheet is partially placed over another without any change in their
   shape. The approach makes use of wire arc additive manufacturing to
   fabricate the tenons and allows various shapes and thicknesses to be
   made from a wide range of metallic materials. Upset compression of the
   tenons is utilized to mechanically lock the two sheets being joined.
   Experimental and finite element simulation works performed with
   monolithic (aluminium-aluminium) and hybrid (aluminium-polymer) `unit
   cells' consisting of a single lap joint are utilized to investigate the
   deformation mechanics and the feasibility of the new proposed joining
   process. Tensile-shear loading tests were carried out to determine the
   maximum force that the new proposed joints are capable to withstand
   without failure. Pull-out forces of approximately 8 and 6 kN for the
   monolithic and hybrid joints allow concluding on the potential of
   additive manufactured `mortise-and-tenon' lap joints to connect sheets
   made from similar and dissimilar materials.},

Abstract = {Polymer mechanochemistry converts mechanical forces in materials to
   chemical reactions through the response of functional groups known as
   mechanophores. This Review discusses the colorimetric, mechanical,
   chemical and electronic responses of mechanophores that may be useful in
   materials for strain sensing and strengthening, soft devices and
   additive manufacturing.
   The use of mechanical forces to chemically transform polymers dates back
   decades. In recent years, the use of mechanochemistry to direct
   constructive transformations in polymers has resulted in a range of
   engineered molecular responses that span optical, mechanical, electronic
   and thermal properties. The chemistry that has been developed is now
   well positioned for use in materials science, polymer physics, mechanics
   and additive manufacturing. Here, we review the historical backdrop of
   polymer mechanochemistry, give an overview of the existing toolbox of
   mechanophores and associated theoretical methods, and speculate as to
   emerging opportunities in materials science for which current
   capabilities are seemingly well suited. Non-linear mechanical responses
   and internal, amplifying stimulus-response feedback loops, including
   those enabled by, or coupled to, microstructured metamaterial
   architectures, are seen as particularly promising.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing, including fused deposition modelling, is a

   However, the ability to produce suitable fire-retarded materials via
   this process has never been studied extensively. This work focuses on
   understanding the relation between reaction to fire and numerous
   additive manufacturing parameters. The goal was to determine the impact
   of those parameters on standard fire tests such as flame propagation
   test (UL94V) and cone calorimetry. The results were compared with
   material samples formulated via usual processes. On one hand, flame
   propagation results are impacted by many additive manufacturing
   parameters, such as the design of the part and the material flow. On the
   other hand, cone calorimeter results are only influenced by parameters
   having an impact on the sample mass.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   The thermoplastic polymers do not decompose easily due to the presence
   of long-chain stable polymeric structure, and thus, causes serious
   effects on the environment. Recycling of these polymer wastes becomes
   the only solution to minimize their adverse effects on the environment.
   The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of using
   recycled thermoplastic material as filament for fused deposition
   modeling technique.
   Design/methodology/approach
   In this study, the researchers fabricated fused filaments (in-house) for
   fused deposition modeling (FDM) technique of additive manufacturing from
   secondary recycled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) by using a
   twin-screw extruder. After measuring the melt flow index of the
   secondary recycled ABS, the twin-screw extrusion parameters (rpm/speed
   of the screw, extrusion temperature and load) were varied to predict
   their influence on the various properties
   (rheological/mechanical/thermal) of the fabricated filaments.
   Experimental work was executed as per Taguchi's L9 orthogonal array.
   Findings
   Thermal analysis performed to estimate the heat carrying capacity of
   recycled ABS highlighted that the heat capacity of ABS increases
   significantly from 0.28 J/g to 3.94 J/g during the heating cycle. The
   maximum value of peak strength and percentage break elongation for the
   fused filaments was investigated at 12.5 kg load, 2,250 C extrusion
   temperature and 70 rpm speed.
   Originality/value
   The filaments fabricated by recycling the polymeric waste has been
   successfully used in the FDM machine for the preparation of the
   three-dimensional printed tensile specimen.},

Title = {Development of carbon fiber acrylonitrile styrene acrylate composite for
   large format additive manufacturing},
Journal = {MATERIALS \& DESIGN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {191},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The increasing interest of Large Format Additive Manufacturing (LFAM)
   technologies in various industrial sectors mainly lies on the attainable
   production of pieces reaching several cubic meters. These new
   technologies require the development of optimized materials with
   two-folded capabilities, able to satisfy functional in-service
   requirements but also showing a proper printability. Acrylonitrile
   Styrene Acrylate (ASA) is among the most interesting thermoplastic
   materials to be implemented in a LFAM device due to its excellent
   wettability and mechanical properties.
   This research focuses on the development and characterization of ASA and
   carbon fiber (CF) ASA composites suitable for LFAM. The rheological,
   thermal and mechanical properties of neat ASA and ASA containing 20 wt\%
   CF are addressed. The results evidence the higher performance of the CF
   loaded composite compared to the raw ASA polymer (i.e., the 20 wt\% CF
   composite shows a 350\% increase in flexural Young's Modulus and a 500\%
   increment in thermal conductivity compared with neat ASA). Additionally,
   both materials were successfully printed along perpendicular directions
   (X and Z), showing the maximum tensile strain for the composite printed
   along the X orientation as was expected. The results of the flexural
   tests are comparable or slightly higher than those of injected parts.
   Finally, the fracture surface was analysed, identifying different types
   of porosity. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {A graph-based path planning method for additive manufacturing of
   continuous fiber-reinforced planar thin-walled cellular structures},
Journal = {RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Purpose Composite cellular structures have wide application in advanced
   engineering fields due to their high specific stiffness and strength. As
   an emerging technology, continuous fiber-reinforced polymer additive
   manufacturing provides a cost-effective solution for fabricating
   composite cellular structures with complex designs. However, the
   corresponding path planning methods are case-specific and have not
   considered any manufacturing constraints. This study aims to develop a
   generally applicable path planning method to fill the above research
   gap. Design/methodology/approach This study proposes a path planning
   method based on the graph theory, yielding an infill toolpath with a
   minimum fiber cutting frequency, printing time and total turning angle.
   More specifically, the cellular structure design is converted to a graph
   first. Then, the graph is modified to search an Eulerian path by adding
   an optimal set of extra edges determined through the integer linear
   programming method. Finally, the toolpath with minimum total turning
   angle is obtained with a constrained Euler path search algorithm.
   Findings The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through
   the fabrication of both periodic and nonperiodic composite cellular
   structures, i.e. triangular unit cell-based, Voronoi diagram-based and
   topology optimized structures. The proposed method provides the basis
   for manufacturing planar thin-walled cellular structures of continuous
   fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP). Moreover, the proposed method shows a
   notable improvement compared with the existing method. The fiber cutting
   frequency, printing time and total turning angle have been reduced up to
   88.7\%, 52.6\% and 65.5\%, respectively. Originality/value A generally
   applicable path planning method is developed to generate continuous
   toolpaths for fabricating cellular structures in CFRP-additive
   manufacturing, which is an emerging technology. More importantly,
   manufacturing constraints such as fiber cutting frequency, printing time
   and total turning angle of fibers are considered within the process
   planning for the first time.},

Abstract = {Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM), is an additive manufacturing
   technology where polymers are extruded using appropriate processing
   parameters to achieve suitable bonding while ensuring that overheating
   does not occur. Among processing parameters, polymer inlet temperature,
   nozzle size, extrusion speed, and air cooling speed are significantly
   effect on the extrusion process at the distance between the build plate
   and the nozzle tip (standoff region). This study aims to evaluate the
   influences of the processing parameters on the thermal behavior and
   phase change zone of Polyamide 12 (PA12) and Acrylonitrile Butadiene
   Styrene (ABS) polymers at standoff region. A nonlinear three-dimensional
   (3D) finite element (FE) model was developed by implementing an apparent
   heat capacity model using the Heat Transfer Module in COMSOL (R)
   Multiphysics software. FE results in the standoff region were validated
   by experimental tests, concerning various nozzle sizes and extrusion
   speed. The validated numerical results demonstrated that there is a
   complex correlation between processing parameters and thermal behaviors
   such as phase change and temperature distribution in the standoff
   region. The FE results were then employed in training an artificial
   neural network (ANN). A well-established compromise between the trained
   ANN and the FE results demonstrates that the trained ANN can be employed
   in the prediction of further thermal and glass transition behavior using
   subsequent processing parameters.},

Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A cork-like filament fully biodegradable and filled with low
   granulometry cork powder residues was developed. Cork-polymer composites
   (CPC) were prepared using a Brabender type mixer incorporating 15\%
   (w/w) of cork powder (corresponding to 55\% (v/v)) and having polylactic
   acid (PLA) as matrix. In order to promote a chemical adhesion between
   cork particles and PLA, the effect of maleic anhydride grafted PLA
   (MAgPLA) was studied. Fourier Transform Infrared - Attenuated Total
   Reflection (FTIR-ATR) analysis was used to evaluate the
   functionalization of MAgPLA onto the polymeric chain. The addition of
   MAgPLA enhanced the mechanical behavior by increasing tensile properties
   while improving the dispersion of cork particles within PLA matrix. In
   addition, cork particles and MAgPLA acted as nucleating agents during
   PLA melting process. To evaluate the printability of the developed CPC
   filament, specimens were printed by Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) and
   compared to those obtained by injection molding (IM). FFF allowed to
   preserve the cork alveolar structure in the specimens, benefiting CPC
   mechanical behavior. 3D parts could be printed with the CPC filament
   thereby demonstrating the usefulness of the fully biodegradable
   cork-based filament here developed. 3D printed parts exhibit unique
   characteristics, such as a nonplastic and warm touch, a natural colour
   and the release of a pleasant odour during the printing process.},

Abstract = {The combination of electrochemically active microorganisms with
   miniaturized electronics has immense potential for augmenting a wide
   range of practical bioelectronic applications such as biosensing,
   bioenergy harvesting, and bio-electrosynthesis. However, a major
   challenge to the controllable and seamless integration of biological
   systems and external electronics is the fundamental mismatch in
   physicochemical properties and weak signal transmission between the
   biotic-abiotic interfaces. Here, we demonstrated an innovative method to
   fabricate the conductive-polymer-bacteria living electrode with a rapid
   and controllable 3-D printing platform and simple electrochemical
   polymerization techniques. The monomer precursor
   3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) was printed into a 3-electrode
   electrochemical cell containing the exoelectrogen Shewanella oneidensis
   wild type MR-1. The monomer was in-situ electrochemically polymerized to
   the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT),
   entrapping and connecting the electrochemically active bacteria to the
   electrode within 35 min. Using cyclic voltammetry (CV), the living
   electrode showed enhanced bio-electrochemical activities, providing
   transformative development for bioenergy harvesters, biosensors and
   biomedical devices. {[}2020-0082]},

Title = {Topology optimization based channel design for powder-bed additive
   manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {54},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) technology allows us to manufacture 3D
   models with arbitrarily complex shapes. Among different AM technologies,
   powder-based 3D printing techniques, such as laser-based powder bed
   fusion of metals and polymers (PBF-LB/M and PBF-LB/P), are common tools
   favored by engineers and have been widely used in the industrial field.
   In order to reduce the cost of printing materials, a large variety of
   lightweight infill structures have been proposed, such as skin-frame
   structures, lattice structures, honeycomb structures and porous
   structures. Currently, most of the proposed methods lead to a large
   number of closed voids in the printed models. These closed voids are
   particularly detrimental to structures printed using powder-based 3D
   printing techniques. A large amount of powder remains in the closed
   voids and cannot be discharged, which will reduce the performance of the
   printed structure. This problem limits the application of powder-based
   3D printing techniques for printing complex structures. To the best of
   our knowledge, very few investigations have been conducted to address
   this problem. In this paper, a method based on topology optimization
   (TO) is proposed to automatically generate channels between closed voids
   and outlets, by which the remaining powder of the powder-based printing
   structures can be discharged. The proposed method consists of three main
   steps: 1) topology optimization, 2) topology extraction, 3) channel
   generation. Six standard structures with a large number of closed voids
   are investigated to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed
   method. In addition, experimental tests are conducted to validate the
   effectiveness of the generated channels.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a promising technique for producing
   complex parts layer by layer from different metal alloys. Selective
   Laser Melting (SLM) consists of melting a previously formed powder layer
   by laser and fusing layers together according to the CAD-data. SLM is a
   promising method for producing custom-made implants from titanium
   powders due to the possibility of creating geometrically complex parts
   with high mechanical properties directly from the CAD-file.
   In the presented work, a hip implant was manufactured by SLM from plasma
   atomized Ti-6Al-4V powder. Computer-tomography data of the patient's
   deformed bone structure was used for 3D-printing the patient's hip bone
   model from polyamide. Then an implant prototype was made from polymer
   accounting the anatomical features of the patient. The implant model was
   3D-scanned to obtain a CAD-file of the implants, which was further
   improved using CAD-software by partial texting of its surface. Titanium
   implant was produced by SLM and then annealed to achieve the better
   combination of tensile strength and elongation by partial decomposition
   of martensitic phase, which allowed the mechanical properties of the
   produced material meet the requirements of ASTM F2924 for additively
   manufactured Ti-6Al-4V alloy and ISO 5832-3 Implants for surgery from
   titanium 6-aluminum 4-vanadium alloy. The hip implant has been
   successfully installed to the patient. The postoperative supervision has
   shown a good result. Applying AM for producing the custom hip implant
   allowed decrease the operation time and lessen the risk of the infection
   ingress.},

Title = {Experimental Characterization Framework for SLA Additive Manufacturing
   Materials},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is driving a change in the industry not only
   regarding prototyping but due to the ease of including printed parts in
   final designs. Engineers and designers can go deeper into optimization
   and improvements of their designs without drawbacks of long
   manufacturing times. However, some drawbacks such as the limited
   available materials or uncertainty about mechanical properties and
   anisotropic behavior of 3D printed parts prevent use in large-scale
   production. To gain knowledge and confidence about printed materials it
   is necessary to know how they behave under different stress states and
   strain-rate regimes, and how some of the printing parameters may affect
   them. The present work proposes an experimental methodology framework to
   study and characterize materials printed by stereolithography (SLA) to
   clarify certain aspects that must be taken into account to broaden the
   use of this kind of material. To this end, tensile and compression tests
   at different strain rates were carried out. To study the influence of
   certain printing parameters on the printed material behavior, samples
   with different printing angles (theta = {[}0-90]) and different printing
   resolution (layer height of 50 and 100 mu m) were tested. In addition,
   the effects of curing time and temperature were also studied. The
   testing specimens were manufactured in the non-professional SLA machine
   Form 2 from Formlabs(R) using resin called Durable. Nevertheless, the
   proposed experimental methodology could be extended to any other resin.},

Abstract = {Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer has been widely used in the
   biomedical fields because of its biocompatibility, being used as
   sensors, medical equipment and tissue implants. The present study aims
   to synthesize and characterize micro lane-type surface patterns of PDMS
   polymers and evaluate their effects on mechanical properties for various
   applications in the bio-engineering field. Fabrication of surface
   patterns is achieved using fused filament fabrication in additive
   manufacturing, and the mechanical properties of the polymer specimens
   with the surface patterns are measured using tensile test. The surface
   patterns are rotated at different angles and changed into different
   shapes to change the anisotropic material properties of the PDMS
   specimens. This is achieved by changing the raster angles and modifying
   the fused filament paths during the additive manufacturing process. In
   addition, the application of the printed pattern to medical soft robot
   is presented. Owing to the anisotropic material properties, in-plane and
   out-of-plane actuation can be realized by attaching polymer patches with
   different lane-type surface patterns. The results of this study support
   the implementation of additive manufacturing for the rapid manufacture
   of scalable structures with anisotropic material properties for various

Abstract = {Lab scale additive manufacturing of Fe-Nd-B based powders was performed
   to realize bulk nanocrystalline Fe-Nd-B based permanent magnets. For
   fabrication a special inert gas process chamber for laser powder bed
   fusion was used. Inspired by the nanocrystalline ribbon structures,
   well-known from melt-spinning, the concept was successfully transferred
   to the additive manufactured parts. For example, for
   Nd16.5-Pr1.5-Zr2.6-Ti2.5-Co2.2-Fe65.9-B8.8 (excess rare earth (RE) = Nd,
   Pr; the amount of additives was chosen following Magnequench (MQ) powder
   composition) a maximum coercivity of mu H-0(c) = 1.16 T, remanence J(r)
   = 0.58 T and maximum energy density of (BH)(max) = 62.3 kJ/m(3) have
   been achieved. The most important prerequisite to develop
   nanocrystalline printed parts with good magnetic properties is to enable
   rapid solidification during selective laser melting. This is made
   possible by a shallow melt pool during laser melting. Melt pool depths
   as low as 20 to 40 mu m have been achieved. The printed bulk
   nanocrystalline Fe-Nd-B based permanent magnets have the potential to
   realize magnets known so far as polymer bonded magnets without polymer.},

Abstract = {Purpose-Flame-retardant plastics are used in critical applications, such
   as aircraft interior parts, when the occurrence of fire can lead to
   serious injury to people. However, there is a lack of related
   publications. The purpose of this study is to present experimental data
   regarding geometrical analysis, such as dimensional accuracy and surface
   roughness, tensile strength and elongation of parts manufactured with
   flame-retardant materials by additive manufacturing.
   Design/methodology/approach-Two additive manufacturing processes,
   selective laser sintering (SLS) and fused deposition modeling (FDM),
   were selected to manufacture the parts to be evaluated. Each process
   used its respective polymer, that is polyamide with flame-retardant
   additive (PA) for SLS and polyphenylsulfone (PPSF) for FDM. The samples
   consist of tensile specimens and representative parts of different
   products. Tensile tests were performed using standard tensile test
   machines, and geometrical analyses were performed using coordinate
   measuring machine as well as surface roughness tester.
   Findings-As each material can be, in commercial machines, produced by
   only one process, the material selection for final products has to
   consider the manufacturing process as well. In general, although the
   FDM/PPSF process provided specimens with the highest ultimate strength,
   because of its strong influence by the building direction, FDM/PPSF also
   provided the lowest strength. SLS/PA was able to provide average
   strength with less dependency on the build-up direction. The geometrical
   analysis showed that SLS/PA presents a much smoother surface, but
   FDM/PPSF presented slightly better dimensional accuracy.
   Originality/value-There is still lack of publications on polymers with
   flame resistance or flame-retardant polymers. Thus, this paper brings
   new technical information about processing such materials.},

Abstract = {Metal oxide nano additives are widely used as a second phase modifier as
   they improve the properties of the matrix materials. Nano additives also
   supply various advantages for polymers which can be employed in additive
   manufacturing methods. Among the additive manufacturing methods,
   stereolithography is one of the most remarkable to produce nano-modified
   polymers because of the easy nano modification of the photocurable
   resins. In the present study, we mixed the metal oxide particles; Fe2O3,
   ZnO, NiO, Al2O3, TiO2, and MgO with the photocurable epoxy and used the
   mixtures to print the specimens. We investigated the structural
   morphology, thermal and mechanical properties of the printed specimens
   with an optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimeter,
   differential thermogravimetric analysis, and microhardness,
   respectively. Findings proved the dilute agglomeration of the nano
   additives. Besides, nano additives can improve the thermal stability of
   the photo-cured polymer. The microhardness of the Fe2O3 added polymers
   reached 27.63 HV levels while it was measured as 16.16 HV for the
   pristine samples (similar to 70\% raise was experienced). The maximum
   degradation temperatures of the polymer nanocomposite structures were
   measured in the range of 396-420 degrees C.},

Title = {Joining of carbon fiber reinforced polymer/titanium stacks using
   directed energy deposition additive manufacturing},
Journal = {COMPOSITE STRUCTURES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {310},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {In this work, we successfully fabricated CFRP/Ti stacks with reliable
   interfacial bonding using the directed energy deposition (DED) additive
   manufacturing (AM) technique. Compared to traditional laser welding, the
   DED process can produce a smaller penetration depth due to the ejection
   of feedstocks into the melt pool. Such an additive process also enables
   the multilayer deposition of three-dimensional (3D) Ti alloys with a
   designed structure to coalesce with the CFRP plate. This study utilized
   numerical modeling and experiments to uncover the interface formation
   mechanisms and bonding performance of CFRP/Ti stacks fabricated at
   different laser powers. The cross-sectional morphologies of CFRP/Ti
   stacks were observed by an optical microscope (OM) and a scan-ning
   electron microscope (SEM). Physical gaps and pores existed along CFRP/Ti
   interface and within CFRP substrates, respectively. The bonding
   performance of overall CFRP/Ti stacks was also assessed by lap shear
   tensile testing. The lap shear tensile strength increased first and then
   decreased with laser power. The fracture failure of CFRP/Ti interface
   was characterized by a SEM and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
   which indicated the mixed adhesion and cohesion failure mode of
   DED-joint stacks. This work provides a novel CFRP/Ti stack joining
   paradigm through DED, paving the way for AM of multi-material
   lightweight components.},

Abstract = {The selectivity between electrically conductive and insulating regions
   within one additively manufactured part can open new domains for
   customized, smart, and active products. In this article, new
   electrically conductive polymer matrix composites (ePMC) were developed
   for additive manufacturing (AM) by loading an aqueous matrix of
   carboxymethyl cellulose with micro-sized graphite particles.
   Electrically conductive AM can be achieved using the developed ePMC with
   the direct ink writing (DIW) technique. The effects of graphite loading
   on the properties of ePMCs and their suitability for AM were
   investigated using various characterization techniques. The
   non-Newtonian shear-thinning behavior of the ePMC inks indicates the
   suitability of these inks for DIW. Tunable electrical conductivity in
   the range of 87-128 S m(-1) can be achieved with a 15\% margin of error.
   DIW of scaffolds with rectilinear and honeycomb infill patterns
   demonstrate the additive manufacturability of the developed ePMCs.
   Furthermore, an application of additively manufactured and electrically
   conductive part as a heating element was demonstrated. The developed
   ePMCs can be employed in diverse applications such as AM of conductive
   tracks, resistors, and electrodes for capacitors and energy storage
   devices.},

Title = {A comprehensive review on additive manufacturing of glass: Recent
   progress and future outlook},
Journal = {MATERIALS \& DESIGN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {227},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {As an advanced and revolutionary technology, additive manufacturing (AM)
   has received significant research attention in the field of materials
   processing. It is also gradually being applied to glass manufacturing
   owing to its significant advantages of being able to fabricate glass
   components with arbitrary and complex geometry. In addition, it ensures
   a high spatial resolution, low surface roughness (without polishing
   treatment), high optical transparency, and guarantees accuracy in terms
   of small-scale characteristics. Whilst the development of AM technology
   in glass manufacturing is relatively slower than in polymer, metal, and
   ceramics manufacturing, it has made considerable progress in the
   fabrication of functional glass devices, including gradient refractive
   index optics, microlenses, colour converters, microfluidics, and
   micro-toroid optical resonators. Great potential has been exhibited on
   multi-material, multi-scale, multi-functionality (M-3), and hybrid
   additive manufacturing, it will definitely be the future trend on
   transparent glass components fabrication. This review provides a
   systematic summary of different AM techniques, with an emphasis on the
   printing strategies, resolution, multi-material capability, and property
   evaluation of glass. In addition, the defect formation, feasible
   solutions, and potentially suitable applications are discussed. An
   in-depth analysis of the current limitations and perspectives on the
   future developments of each category of AM are also provided. (c) 2023

Abstract = {Ceramic additive manufacturing (C-AM) is highlighted as a technology
   that can overcome the inherent limitations of ceramics such as
   processability and formability. This process creates a structure by
   slicing a 3D model and stacking ceramic materials layer-by-layer without
   mold or machining. C-AM is a technology suitable for the era of multiple
   low-volume because it is more flexible than conventional methods for
   shape complexity and design modification. However, many barriers to
   practical use remain due to process speed, defects, and lack of
   knowledge. This review focuses on studies to overcome the limitations of
   C-AM in terms of process and materials. The C-AM process has been
   advanced through various studies such as model/equation-based parameter
   control and high-speed sintering using external energy. Besides, by
   improving and fusing existing technologies, high-precision high-speed
   printing technology has been improved. A variety of material studies
   have been made of manufacturing ceramic structures with superior
   properties using preceramic polymers and composite materials. Through
   these studies, C-AM has been applied to various fields such as medicine,
   energy, environment, machinery, and architecture. These continued
   growths and diverse results demonstrate the importance and potential of
   C-AM based ceramic manufacturing technology.},

Abstract = {Magnetically isotropic bonded magnets with a high loading fraction of 70
   vol.\% Nd-Fe-B are fabricated via an extrusion-based additive
   manufacturing, or 3D printing system that enables rapid production of
   large parts. The density of the printed magnet is similar to 5.2
   g/cm(3). The room temperature magnetic properties are: intrinsic
   coercivity H-ci = 8.9 kOe (708.2 kA/m), remanence B-r = 5.8 kG (0.58 T),
   and energy product (BH)max = 7.3 MGOe (58.1 kJ/m(3)). The as-printed
   magnets are then coated with two types of polymers, both of which
   improve the thermal stability as revealed by flux aging loss
   measurements. Tensile tests performed at 25 degrees C and 100 degrees C
   show that the ultimate tensile stress (UTS) increases with increasing
   loading fraction of the magnet powder, and decreases with increasing
   temperature. AC magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements
   show that the 3D printed Nd-Fe-B bonded magnets exhibit extremely low
   eddy current loss and high resistivity. Finally, we demonstrate the
   performance of the 3D printed magnets in a DC motor configuration via
   back electromotive force measurements.},

Abstract = {This study presents a fabrication method and identifies processing
   bounds for additively manufacturing (AM) ceramic matrix composites
   (CMCs), comprising a silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) ceramic matrix. A digital
   light projection printer was used to photopolymerize a siloxane-based
   preceramic resin containing inert ceramic reinforcement. A subsequent
   pyrolysis converted the preceramic polymer to SiOC. Particle
   reinforcements of 0 to 40\% by volume in the green state were uniformly
   dispersed in the printed samples to study their effects on pyrolysis
   mass loss and shrinkage, and CMC notch sensitivity and strength. Both
   particle and whisker reinforcements toughened the glassy SiOC matrix (1
   MPa m(1/2)), reaching values >3 MPa m(1/2). Bending strengths of >300
   MPa (>150 MPa (g cm(-3))(-1)) and a Weibull modulus of 10 were measured
   on AM samples without surface finish. We identified two pore formation
   mechanisms that placed processing bounds on sample size and
   reinforcement volume fraction. Methods for increasing these bounds are
   discussed. With properties commensurate to traditionally processed
   technical ceramics, the presented process allows for free-form
   fabrication of high-performance AM CMC components.},

Pages = {143-160},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing is being utilised in biomedical applications for
   drug delivery and soft tissue engineering as a key enabling technology
   for precision medicine. Unlike conventional manufacturing techniques,
   additive manufacturing can fabricate customised interventions with
   relative ease. In drug delivery, other drivers for growth in the
   technology is the production of complex dosage forms, incorporating
   multiple drugs and materials, and the pursuit of on-demand
   manufacturing. For tissue engineering applications, additive
   manufacturing is creating 3D scaffolds to aid or replace the native
   tissue with morphology and internal architecture which mimic the final
   shape and structure of the defective tissue. The chapter details the
   utilisation of additive manufacturing in the production of
   pharmaceutical dosage forms, spanning simple flat-faced oral tablets to
   more complex drug--delivery systems that provide for the independent
   release of multiple drug compounds. For tissue engineering applications,
   the chapter describes the production of scaffolds for various soft
   tissue scaffolds currently under development by research teams
   worldwide.},

Abstract = {3D printing of composites is one of the trending topics in the field of
   additive manufacturing. Several research papers on carbon fiber
   reinforced composites, used carbon fiber tows directly or sized carbon
   fibers as reinforcement for the composite, which is time consuming and
   not reliable as frequent clogging occurs. This paper presents a simple
   method by introducing the novel use of twisted carbon fiber filament and
   analyze its effect on the additive manufactured composites. The matrix
   material used is PLA. The commercially available 3D printers for
   printing continuous fibers, use double nozzle setups for printing the
   matrix and reinforcement separately in a layer by layer manner. However,
   there are no reports on the use of twisted continuous carbon fiber as
   filament and its effect on the printed parts. This paper uses twisted
   carbon fibers with single nozzle setup such that the material coming out
   of the nozzle will be ready to use CCF-PLA composite. Thus, the need of
   separate stacking of each layer of the matrix and fiber can be avoided.
   A separate path process planning has been done for printing the twisted
   carbon fibers in consideration of its continuity and the anisotropy.
   Standard mechanical tests are conducted, and the morphological study of
   the composite is done. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Title = {Manufacturing process-driven structured materials (MPDSMs): design and
   fabrication for extrusion-based additive manufacturing},
Journal = {RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {716-731},
Month = {MAR 29},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to explore the design and fabrication of
   meso-scale Manufacturing Process-Driven Structured Materials (MPDSMs).
   These are designed, architected materials where the prime design
   requirement is manufacturability. The concepts are applied to those
   fabricated using fused deposition modeling or fused filament fabrication
   (FDM/FFF), a thermoplastic polymer additive manufacturing (AM) process.
   Three case studies were presented to demonstrate the approach.
   Design/methodology/approach The paper consists of four main sections;
   the first developed the MPDSMs concept, the second explored
   manufacturability requirements for FDM/FFF in terms of MPDSMs, the third
   presented a practical application framework and the final sections
   provided some case studies and closing remarks. Findings The main
   contributions of this study were the definition and development of the
   MDPSMs concept, the application framework and the original case studies.
   While it is most practical to use a well-defined AM process to first
   explore the concepts, the MPDSMs approach is neither limited to AM nor
   thermoplastic polymer materials nor meso-scale material structures.
   Future research should focus on applications in other areas.
   Originality/value The MPDSMs approach as presented in this concept paper
   is a novel method for the design of structured materials where
   manufacturability is the prime requirement. It is distinct from classic
   design-for-manufacturability concepts in that the design space is
   limited to manufacturable design candidates before the other
   requirements are satisfied. This removes a significant amount of
   schedule and costs risk from the design process, as all the designs
   produced are manufacturable within the problem tolerance.},

Title = {Characterizing the influence of resource-energy-exergy factors on the
   environmental performance of additive manufacturing systems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {48},
Number = {A},
Pages = {87-96},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing is rapidly emerging as an alternative to
   conventional manufacturing, including subtractive processes, often
   attributed to its claim for sustainable product development, e.g.,
   reduced cost, reduced energy and material use, and the distributed
   production of tailored consumer products. However, many of these
   benefits remain unsubstantiated for large-scale production. The aim of
   the research herein is to identify and characterize the factors
   influencing the systemic environmental performance of additive
   manufacturing as an end use of energy, using exergy analysis and life
   cycle assessment. These methods have been previously applied to evaluate
   the environmental performance of conventional and non-conventional
   manufacturing processes, and offer a validated approach to explore the
   environmental impacts of additive manufacturing with respect to systemic
   material and energy losses. In this study, the environmental impacts of
   direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) of iron metal powder and fused
   deposition modeling (FDM) of acrylonitrile styrene acrylate polymer
   filament are characterized by performing a thermodynamic (exergy)
   analysis of the resources and energy utilized and lost from cradle to
   gate. It is found that only 10\% of total DMLS process inputs contribute
   to material processing, while 90\% of the inputs are lost as bulk waste,
   heat, and work. For FDM, it is found that only 7\% of total process
   inputs contribute to material processing, while 93\% are lost. Following
   the exergy analysis, life cycle assessment is performed to characterize
   the environmental impacts of the exergy losses using single-issue
   indicator (Global Warming Potential, GWP) and aggregate indicator
   (ReCiPe 2008) methods. The results show that electricity consumption is
   a key contributor to both focal processes and their related upstream
   processes. The systemic GWP for DMLS is 69 kg CO2 equivalent, while for
   FDM it is 89 kg CO2 equivalent, per kilogram of material processed.
   Using the ReCiPe 2008 method, damage to human health is predicted to
   outweigh damage to ecosystem quality and resource availability for the
   DMLS process. For the FDM process, damage to human health and resource
   availability are predicted to outweigh damage to ecosystems quality.
   This work concludes that electrical energy use is the key contributor to
   systemic environmental impacts of additive manufacturing. Thus, it is
   imperative that we identify solutions to generate clean electrical
   energy, reduce electricity transmission losses, reduce material
   processing energy use, and design products that enable efficient
   additive manufacturing.},

Abstract = {Over the last few decades, advanced manufacturing and additive printing
   technologies have made incredible inroads into the fields of
   engineering, transportation, and healthcare. Among additive
   manufacturing technologies, 3D printing is gradually emerging as a
   powerful technique owing to a combination of attractive features, such
   as fast prototyping, fabrication of complex designs/structures,
   minimization of waste generation, and easy mass customization. Of late,
   4D printing has also been initiated, which is the sophisticated version
   of the 3D printing. It has an extra advantageous feature: retaining
   shape memory and being able to provide instructions to the printed parts
   on how to move or adapt under some environmental conditions, such as,
   water, wind, light, temperature, or other environmental stimuli. This
   advanced printing utilizes the response of smart manufactured materials,
   which offer the capability of changing shapes postproduction over
   application of any forms of energy. The potential application of 4D
   printing in the biomedical field is huge. Here, the technology could be
   applied to tissue engineering, medicine, and configuration of smart
   biomedical devices. Various characteristics of next generation additive
   printings, namely 3D and 4D printings, and their use in enhancing the
   manufacturing domain, their development, and some of the applications
   have been discussed. Special materials with piezoelectric properties and
   shape-changing characteristics have also been discussed in comparison
   with conventional material options for additive printing.},

Abstract = {Binder jet printing (BJP) is a state-of-the-art additive manufacturing
   technique for producing porous magnesium structures. Porous Mg-Zn-Zr
   based BJP samples were assessed for corrosion performance in simulated
   body fluids by electrochemical and hydrogen evolution measurements. The
   corrosion rates of the BJP specimens were significantly higher than
   solid controls, even after accounting for their larger surface areas,
   suggesting that the BJP microstructure is detrimental to corrosion
   performance. X-ray computed tomography revealed nonuni-form corrosion
   within the porous structure, with corrosion products forming on the pore
   walls. Impregnating the pores with hydroxyapatite or polymers greatly
   improved the corrosion resistance of the BJP samples. (C) 2021 Chongqing

Abstract = {PLA, being biocompatible and biodegradable is deployed in additive
   manufacturing technology for research and development purpose in the
   field of healthcare. This work is to study the strength of the PLA in
   varied conditions by incorporating physical transformations through
   internal structuring using additive manufacturing technology and surface
   modifications using chemical reactions. The mechanical stability and
   behaviour of the 3D model depend on its internal structure. The internal
   structure of the model can be changed using various designing software
   before feeding into 3D printer. The most promis-ing hexagonal grid shape
   is incorporated to attain immense load bearing strength with minimal
   material usage by bio mimicking from nature (honeycomb structure). The
   surface of the plastic model is proposed with a metallic coat on its
   surface to increase its mechanical resistance to wear and tear by
   undergoing a sequence of chemical reactions. The mechanical
   characteristics like compressive strength and Shore `D' hardness of the
   normally 3D printed PLA specimen (SAMPLE 1) and metal (Nickel) deposited
   3D printed PLA specimen (SAMPLE 2) is compared. The compressive strength
   of the coated sample has shown an increase in the value compared to the
   pure PLA 3D model. The shore D hardness value for the sample 2 is
   decreased, which shows an increase in the smoothness of the

   Systems: Methodology and a Material Jetting Case Study},

Abstract = {The performance characterization of the manufacturing processes for
   additive manufacturing (AM) systems is a significant task for their
   standardization and implementation in the industry. Also, there is a
   large diversity of materials used in different AM processes. In the
   present paper, a methodology is proposed to evaluate, in different
   directions, the performance of an AM process and material
   characterization in terms of surface quality. This methodology consists
   of eight steps, based on a new surface inspection artifact and basic
   artifact orientations. The proposed artifact with several design
   configurations fits different AM systems sizes and meets the needs of
   customers. The effects of main factors on the surface roughness of
   up-facing platens of the artifacts are investigated using the
   statistical design of experiments. The proposed methodology is validated
   by a case study focused on PolyJet material jetting technology. Samples
   are manufactured of photopolymer resins and post-processed. Three
   factors (i.e., artifact orientation, platen orientation, and finish
   type) are considered for the investigation. The case study results show
   that the platen orientation, finish type, and their interaction have a
   significant influence on the surface roughness (Ra). The best Ra
   roughness results were obtained for the glossy finish type in the range
   of 0.5-4 m.},

Title = {Rheological approach for an additive manufacturing printer based on

Abstract = {Commercially available grades of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and
   acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) were printed in different shapes
   using an additive manufacturing (AM) printer based on material extrusion
   (ME). It is known that the quality of a 3D printed sample is closely
   connected to the rheological properties of the polymer matrix. However,
   some printing parameters, such as the feed rate and the print speed,
   might not be determined only by equipment design as usually reported in
   the literature. Instead, the thermal and rheological properties of the
   polymers should be carefully considered. The focus of many studies has
   relied on optimizing the specific properties of an ME printer through
   the adjustment of the printing parameters. Still, few researchers have
   shown how the rheological behaviour of a material can affect its final
   properties. Therefore, this paper would like to answer satisfactorily
   some recurring questions with clear practical importance, which is
   related to the fact that some materials have better print quality than
   others do and about the feasible margins for increasing the print speed
   according to the characteristics of a polymeric material. Thus, in this
   work, rheological characterization of the resins was conducted and it
   was detected that the processing condition for a specific thermoplastic
   is highly dependent on its rheological behaviour. A method of mass flow
   conservation was presented for determination and consideration of the
   rheological characteristics when selecting an appropriate process
   parameter for the additive manufacturing system. It was found that even
   a small recovery strain resulting from the characteristic morphology of
   ABS could provide lower layers' roughness and good printing quality to
   the 3D printed samples. Thus, the main goal of this work was to evaluate
   the importance of the rheological properties of common thermoplastics
   used in extrusion-based process on the controlling of a 3D printer and
   on the final printing quality.},

Abstract = {The multidisciplinary field of tissue engineering and regenerative
   medicine can benefit from the potential of additive manufacturing as a
   fabrication technique that can realize custom medical devices. This is
   particularly true when referred to the macroscopic dimensions of the
   resulting scaffold, but focussing on the microstructure that should be
   realized to offer a suitable environment to the seeded cells, possible
   drawbacks can be highlighted. In this regard, the present study shows
   the design and validation of a custom-made set-up capable to deliver
   thin polymeric strands, below 100 mu m diameter, to be used for building
   up scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. The aim of this work
   was to develop a specific experimental set-up capable of producing fine
   polymeric structures by means of a computer-controlled polymer
   deposition. As manufacturing method a variation of Pressure Assisted
   Microsyringe was chosen, namely the wet-spinning microsyringe
   deposition, driven by positive displacement as a trade-off between
   implementation complexity and extrusion speed control. For this purpose
   the project started with the design stage to select the proper hardware,
   especially for micro-positioning system's accuracy, then followed by a
   software development step to carefully control the setup. Experimental
   verification was carried out by depositing repeatable polymer filaments
   of poly(epsilon-caprolactone), widely used for tissue engineering
   applications. In order to preliminarily evaluate the feasibility of the
   desired outcome, a computational fluid dynamics analysis was carried out
   simulating a perfusion bioreactor operating at three different
   conditions. The results, either experimental and numerical, showed the
   potential of this combined study (i) to carefully select the most
   relevant processing parameters for collecting suitable strands and (ii)
   to predict the related response when assembled to form a 3D scaffold in
   terms of local fluid dynamics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {The mechanical properties improving filler introduction into polymer
   filaments often lead to the formation of defects in 3D-printed products.
   Studying the bulk modification of polyethylene terephthalate glycol
   (PETG) filaments with 0.5-1.5 wt\% of natural shungite and molybdenum
   disulfide, we found the melt flow index (MFI) value reduced by
   18\%-30\%. We investigate the effect of bulk modification on the
   filaments' rheological properties, develop a technique that eliminates
   typical additive prototyping defects by regulation of the extrusion
   parameters in Cura slicing software, and propose an effective method for
   the MFI-measurement of the 3D-printed filaments that does not require
   special laboratory equipment (plastometers).},

   with Tailored Microstructure via Precipitation Printing},

Abstract = {Current additive manufacturing processes for polymers, including
   material extrusion, vat photopolymerization, material jetting, and
   powder bed fusion, have limitations in manufacturing high-temperature
   thermoplastics including narrow material selection, compromised
   mechanical properties, and potential degradation of materials during
   processing. Polysulfone (PSU) is a high-temperature thermoplastic with
   outstanding chemical resistance, flame retardancy, and toughness.
   However, besides injection molding, additive manufacturing of PSU has
   only been achieved through extrusion or solvent-cast three-dimensional
   (3D) printing without obtaining high mechanical properties. In this
   work, precipitation printing is applied to fabricate high-temperature
   thermoplastics such as PSU for the first time, where tailoring of the
   microstructure and mechanical properties is enabled through control of
   solvents and printing parameters. The printed PSU can either be dense
   and strong with 2.47 GPa Young's modulus and 70.6 MPa tensile strength
   or porous and highly anisotropic. After drying at a maximum temperature
   of 190 degrees C, both the printed dense and porous PSU samples have a
   glass-transition temperature of about 200 degrees C, which allows them
   to be used in high-temperature environments. Thus, precipitation
   printing provides an alternative approach to manufacture
   high-temperature thermoplastics like PSU with scalability and tailorable
   properties.},

Abstract = {Carbon nanotube (CNT) reinforced acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS)
   composites fabricated using a fused deposition modeling approach were
   characterized for mechanical strain energy storage and dissipation
   capabilities. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was performed to
   quantify loss factor as a function of applied dynamic strain. In
   addition, DMA was performed at varying temperatures to give insight into
   the molecular interactions present in these composites. Insight into the
   microstructure was provided by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The
   results are compared to neat ABS and ABS/CNT systems processed through
   an injection molding technique. Results show large energy dissipation,
   accompanied by permanent damage, in both injection molded and additively
   manufactured neat ABS samples. In contrast, the additively manufactured
   ABS/CNT nanocomposites exhibited strain energy dissipation but reduced
   the effect of cavitation and crazing by possible reinforcement. This
   result suggests CNT fillers have the potential to alter the dissipation
   mechanisms present in additively manufactured structures to control
   structural damping. This research provides insight into the design and
   additive manufacturing of materials where energy dissipation is
   essential to maintain structural stability and functionality under
   dynamic loading.},

Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Traditional additive manufacturing (also known as 3D printing) of
   continuous carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CCFRP) lacks the ability to
   manufacture parts with high speed and energy efficiency. This is mainly
   because of the contact needed and the slow heat transfer from the
   conventional hotend to the composite filaments. A microwave heating
   assisted additive manufacturing method is here presented which allows
   manufacturing CCFRP with a higher speed as compared to conventional
   methods. The permittivity of printed specimens with different fiber
   volume fraction was investigated. By using the measured dielectric
   properties, a micro-scale microwave radiation and heat transfer model
   between the fiber and resin matrix has been established. The skin-core
   temperature difference of the moving CCFRP filaments during conventional
   thermal and microwave heating has been simulated to reveal the
   relationship between the temperature difference, filament diameter and
   printing speed. Non-isothermal crystallization behavior and mechanical
   strengths of thermal and microwave printed specimens have been studied,
   and the reasons for the different results have been analyzed.},

Abstract = {Multi-functional additive manufacturing is a promising route to
   achieving exciting new rapid prototyping and in-the-field manufacturing
   capabilities. Ideally, multi-functionality could be imparted to
   materials that can be used with existing additive manufacturing hardware
   with little-to-no modification of the hardware. However, because much of
   the additive manufacturing hardware currently available is highly
   sensitive to the properties of the input material, it is important to
   understand the relationship among the processing/development of the
   input material, its physical properties, and quality and properties of
   the additively manufactured part. To that end, this project explores the
   effects of processing conditions on the electrical properties and
   printability of nanofiller-modified fused deposition modeling (FDM)
   filament. Specifically, pulverized polylactic acid (PLA) is dry mixed
   with carbon nanofibers (CNFs) and extruded through a commercially
   available single-screw filament extruder. Filament resistivity and
   diameter are then statistically characterized as a function of extrusion
   temperature and number of extrusions. Printability is also
   quantitatively and qualitatively characterized using a commercial FDM
   printer. Insights developed through this work could be of considerable
   significance to next-generation additively manufactured
   piezoresistive-based sensors, actuators, and electrical components.},

Title = {A Review on Multiplicity in Multi-Material Additive Manufacturing:
   Process, Capability, Scale, and Structure},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has experienced exponential growth over the
   past two decades and now stands on the cusp of a transformative paradigm
   shift into the realm of multi-functional component manufacturing, known
   as multi-material AM (MMAM). While progress in MMAM has been more
   gradual compared to single-material AM, significant strides have been
   made in exploring the scientific and technological possibilities of this
   emerging field. Researchers have conducted feasibility studies and
   investigated various processes for multi-material deposition,
   encompassing polymeric, metallic, and bio-materials. To facilitate
   further advancements, this review paper addresses the pressing need for
   a consolidated document on MMAM that can serve as a comprehensive guide
   to the state of the art. Previous reviews have tended to focus on
   specific processes or materials, overlooking the overall picture of
   MMAM. Thus, this pioneering review endeavors to synthesize the
   collective knowledge and provide a holistic understanding of the
   multiplicity of materials and multiscale processes employed in MMAM. The
   review commences with an analysis of the implications of multiplicity,
   delving into its advantages, applications, challenges, and issues.
   Subsequently, it offers a detailed examination of MMAM with respect to
   processes, materials, capabilities, scales, and structural aspects.
   Seven standard AM processes and hybrid AM processes are thoroughly
   scrutinized in the context of their adaptation for MMAM, accompanied by
   specific examples, merits, and demerits. The scope of the review
   encompasses material combinations in polymers, composites,
   metals-ceramics, metal alloys, and biomaterials. Furthermore, it
   explores MMAM's capabilities in fabricating bi-metallic structures and
   functionally/compositionally graded materials, providing insights into
   various scale and structural aspects. The review culminates by outlining
   future research directions in MMAM and offering an overall outlook on
   the vast potential of multiplicity in this field. By presenting a
   comprehensive and integrated perspective, this paper aims to catalyze
   further breakthroughs in MMAM, thus propelling the next generation of
   multi-functional component manufacturing to new heights by capitalizing
   on the unprecedented possibilities of MMAM.},

Abstract = {Additive Manufacturing devices or 3D printers allow the possibility of
   creating almost anything. One of the most promising fields of
   application are wearable devices, which can be directly printed on
   textiles. This paper aims to study adhesion forces and warping effects
   when depositing a polymer onto a textile with a low-cost extrusion 3D
   printer. To achieve this, two different polymers (PLA and Filaflex) and
   six of the most common textile materials were selected. L-shaped
   specimens were printed by combining the two polymers and the six
   textiles. Most of the common printing settings were fixed for both
   materials, while the layer quality was 0.1 mm and 0.2 mm. Once printed,
   they were inspected with a Coordinate Measuring Machine and the
   deformation of each specimen was quantified by calculating their maximum
   and minimum displacements. Afterwards, each specimen was axially tested
   to evaluate the adhesion forces between the polymer and the textile. In
   terms of warping, flexible filament showed the lowest values independent
   of printing quality (0.56 mm and 0.3 mm) relative to the rigid filament
   (0.73 mm and 0.8 mm). In terms of adhesion, the combination of a porous
   textile and a flexible filament got the highest values, regardless of
   the layer height selected. The conclusion of this study is that polymer
   textile deposition can be a real manufacturing strategy that should be
   considered when thinking about the design of a wearable device to be
   worn on the body.},

Abstract = {We describe herein a novel strategy for the fabrication of efficient 3D
   printed antibacterial scaffolds. For this purpose, both the surface
   topography as well as the chemical composition of 3D scaffolds
   fabricated by additive manufacturing were modified. The scaffolds were
   fabricated by fused deposition modeling (FDM) using high-impact
   polystyrene (HIPS) filaments. The surface of the objects was then
   topographically modified providing materials with porous surfaces by
   means of the Breath Figures approach. The strategy involves the
   immersion of the scaffold in a polymer solution during a precise period
   of time. This approach permitted the modification of the pore size
   varying the immersion time as well as the solution concentration.
   Moreover, by using polymer blend solutions of polystyrene and
   polystyrene-b-poly(acrylic acid) (PS23-b-PAA(18)) and a quaternized
   polystyrene-b-poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate)
   (PS42-b-PDMAEMAQ(17)), the scaffolds were simultaneously chemically
   modified. The surfaces were characterized by scanning electron
   microscopy and infrared spectroscopy. Finally, the biological response
   toward bacteria was explored. Porous surfaces prepared using quaternized
   PDMAEMA as well as those prepared using PAA confer antimicrobial
   activity to the films, i.e., were able to kill on contact Staphylococcus
   aureus employed as model bacteria.},

Title = {Polymer nanocomposites for plasmonics:<i> In</i><i> situ</i> synthesis
   of gold nanoparticles after additive manufacturing},
Journal = {POLYMER TESTING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {117},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A series of nanocomposites containing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are
   prepared by stereolithography (SL) by simply adding a precursor (KAuCl4)
   to a photoresist. A thermal treatment is performed after manufacturing
   the nanocomposites, triggering the reduction of KAuCl4 into AuNPs in
   solid state. In this approach, the photo -polymerization of the resin
   and the formation of the AuNPs occur independently, allowing the
   optimization of these two processes separately. Advanced electron
   microscopy analyses reveal the distribution, size and morphology of the
   AuNPs synthesized within the resin, showing the influence of the gold
   precursor concentration and different thermal treatments. The localized
   surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the AuNPs modifies the optical
   properties of the 3D-printed nanocomposites, yielding transparent yet
   colored materials even for con-centrations as low as 0.1 wt\% KAuCl4.
   This behavior can be modelled by the Mie theory, correlating the
   macroscopic properties of the nanocomposites with the individual AuNPs
   embedded in the resin. The possibility of tuning the LSPR of the AuNPs
   together with the ability of manufacturing 3D-structures with
   sub-millimeter precision by SL, paves the way for the design of advanced
   platforms for plasmonics, such as sensors for sur-face enhanced Raman
   spectroscopy (SERS).},

Abstract = {With an exponential rise in the popularity and availability of additive
   manufacturing (AM), a large focus has been directed toward research in
   this topic's movement, while trying to distinguish themselves from
   similar works by simply adding nanomaterials to their process. Though
   nanomaterials can add impressive properties to nanocomposites (NCs),
   there are expansive amounts of opportunities that are left unexplored by
   simply combining AM with NCs without discovering synergistic effects and
   novel emerging material properties that are not possible by each of
   these alone. Cooperative, evolving properties of NCs in AM can be
   investigated at the processing, morphological, and architectural levels.
   Each of these categories are studied as a function of the amplifying
   relationship between nanomaterials and AM, with each showing the
   systematically selected material and method to advance the material
   performance, explore emergent properties, as well as improve the AM
   process itself. Innovative, advanced materials are key to faster
   development cycles in disruptive technologies for bioengineering,
   defense, and transportation sectors. This is only possible by focusing
   on synergism and amplification within additive manufacturing of
   nanocomposites.},

Title = {Influence of packing density and fillers on thermal conductivity of
   polymer powders for additive manufacturing},

Volume = {117},
Number = {7-8, SI},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing of polymer powders is nowadays an industrial
   production technology. Complex thermal phenomena occur during
   processing, mainly related to the interaction dynamics among laser,
   powder, and heating system, and also to the subsequent cool-down phase
   from the melt to the parts. Thermal conductivity of the powder is a key
   property for material processing, since an inhomogeneous temperature
   field in the powder cake leads to uneven part properties and can
   strongly limit productivity because only a smaller portion of the build
   chamber can be used. Nevertheless, little is known about the
   relationship between thermal conductivity, packing density, and presence
   of fillers, which are used to enhance specific properties such as high
   temperature resistance or stiffness. The development and consequent
   validation of a device capable of measuring thermal conductivity as a
   function of powder packing density are then extremely important,
   providing an additional tool to characterize powders during the
   development process of new materials for PBF of polymers. The results
   showed a positive correlation between packing density and thermal
   conductivity for some commercially available materials, with an increase
   of the latter of about 10 to 40\% with an increase of the packing
   density from 0 to 100\%. Problems arose in trying to replicate the
   compaction state of the powder, since the same amount of taps led to a
   different packing density, but this is a known problem of measuring
   free-flowing powders such as the ones used for additive manufacturing.
   Regarding fillers, an increase of about 40 to 70\% of thermal
   conductivity when inorganic fillers such as carbon fibers are added to
   the neat polymer was observed, and the expected behavior following the
   rule of mixture was only partially observed.},

Title = {Preparation and 3D printability study of bio-based PBAT powder for
   selective laser sintering additive manufacturing},
Journal = {MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {33},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) has been recognized as a highly versatile
   manufacturing method with high potentiality. Polymers are materials of
   central importance for AM specifically for fabrication of original and
   customized parts. However, most of the polymers currently in use derive
   from fossil sources, which extensive use represents a critical issue for
   the environment. This scenario encourages the use of sustainable and
   biodegradable biopolymers. The present paper focuses on the study of the
   printability of a bio-based powder, starting from an aromatic-aliphatic
   biodegradable polyester, poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate)
   (PBAT), as sustainable alternative for Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)
   conventional materials. Bio-based polymers represent environmentally
   friendly materials that can be suitable for AM, although several
   problems still need to be solved for SLS applications. In fact, it is
   challenging to produce polymeric powders with specific particle size and
   size distribution, spherical shape, good flowability and processability.
   From this point of view, PBAT powder was prepared by means of an
   emulsion solvent evaporation method, characterized from morphological
   and thermal points of view, and then successfully used for SLS process,
   with the aim to obtain novel 3D printed objects using for the first time
   this biodegradable polymer.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing is a rapidly developing technology that enables
   the production of complex parts with intricate geometries.
   Self-lubricating radial bearings are one of the machine elements that
   can be produced using additive manufacturing. In this research, we
   present a machine learning-based approach to model the friction
   coefficient and friction torque in self-lubricating radial bearings
   manufactured by additive manufacturing using polyether ether ketone
   (PEEK), polylactic acid (PLA), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS),
   and nylon. The proposed approach includes different machine learning
   models (artificial neural networks, support vector machines, regression
   trees, linear regression models) that utilize experimental data to
   predict the coefficient of friction and friction torque of different
   types of radial bearings. Experimental data were obtained by performing
   tribological tests on self-lubricating radial bearings under various
   operating conditions. The results reveal that the machine learning
   models are successful in predicting the friction coefficient and
   friction torque in self-lubricating radial bearings with high accuracy.
   The approach can be utilized to optimize the design and performance of
   self-lubricating radial bearings manufactured using additive
   manufacturing.},

Abstract = {The advantages of additive manufactured scaffolds, as custom-shaped
   structures with a completely interconnected and accessible pore network
   from the micro- to the macroscale, are nowadays well established in
   tissue engineering. Pore volume and architecture can be designed in a
   controlled fashion, resulting in a modulation of scaffold's mechanical
   properties and in an optimal nutrient perfusion determinant for cell
   survival. However, the success of an engineered tissue architecture is
   often linked to its surface properties as well. The aim of this study
   was to create a family of polymeric pastes comprised of poly(ethylene
   oxide therephthalate)/poly(butylene terephthalate) (PEOT/PBT)
   microspheres and of a second biocompatible polymeric phase acting as a
   binder. By combining microspheres with additive manufacturing
   technologies, we produced 3D scaffolds possessing a tailorable surface
   roughness, which resulted in improved cell adhesion and increased
   metabolic activity. Furthermore, these scaffolds may offer the potential
   to act as drug delivery systems to steer tissue regeneration.</p>},

Abstract = {Interface is the Achilles' heel in flexible electronics, where slipping,
   delamination, or cracking resulting from the intrinsic mechanical
   property mismatch of different materials might fail the device or cause
   degradation. Robust connections with strong interfacial strength and low
   interfacial impedance are highly desired in all kinds of flexible
   devices, especially when they require stretchability. Here, a new
   strategy of employing homogeneity is proposed to facilely achieve robust
   connection without introducing a third-party interlayer. The key to this
   strategy is implementing different functions in the same component
   materials, and in this work, this strategy is demonstrated by exploring
   the uniformity of carbon nanotube (CNT) in thermoplastic polyurethane
   (TPU) elastomer. Tuning the uniformity of CNT in TPU elastomer, two
   kinds of CNT-TPU composites (CTCs) are fabricated. They present
   contrasting properties of conductivity (281 folds), Young's modulus (7.1
   folds), and strain sensitivity (15.7 folds) with the same weight
   fraction of CNT (15 wt \%), and thus they can respectively act as strain
   sensor and interconnector in all-CNT-based stretchable strain monitoring
   electronics. The interlocking effect caused by spontaneous entanglement
   of surface polymer chains and the reconstruction of percolation network
   at the interface during drying confer the connection with robustness.
   The practical value of this strategy has been exemplified by the
   fabrication of a robust epidermis device via additive manufacturing.
   This epidermis device is patterned in a fractal motif for conformal
   contact and can sensitively monitor body motions and radial artery
   pulse.},

   Manufacturing},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing is one the most promising fabrication strategies
   for the fabrication of bone tissue scaffolds using biodegradable
   semi-crystalline polymers. During the fabrication process, polymeric
   material in a molten state is deposited in a platform and starts to
   solidify while cooling down. The build-up of consecutive layers reheats
   the previously deposited material, introducing a complex thermal cycle
   with impacts on the overall properties of printed scaffolds. Therefore,
   the accurate prediction of these thermal cycles is significantly
   important to properly design the additively manufactured polymer
   scaffolds and the bonding between the layers. This paper presents a
   novel multi-stage numerical model, integrating a 2D representation of
   the dynamic deposition process and a 3D thermal evolution model to
   simulate the fabrication process. Numerical simulations show how the
   deposition velocity controls the spatial dimensions of the individual
   deposition layers and the cooling process when consecutive layers are
   deposited during polymer printing. Moreover, numerical results show a
   good agreement with experimental results.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Current personalized treatment of neurological diseases is limited by
   availability of appropriate manufacturing methods suitable for long term
   sensors for neural electrical activities in the brain. An additive
   manufacturing process for polymer-based biocompatible neural sensors for
   chronic application towards individualized implants is here presented.
   To process thermal crosslinking polymers, the developed extrusion
   process enables, in combination with an infrared (IR)-Laser, accelerated
   curing directly after passing the outlet of the nozzle. As a result, no
   additional curing steps are necessary during the build-up. Furthermore,
   the minimal structure size can be achieved using the laser and, in
   combination with the extrusion parameters, provide structural
   resolutions desired. Active implant components fabricated using
   biocompatible materials for both conductive pathways and insulating
   cladding keep their biocompatible properties even after the additive
   manufacturing process. In addition, first characterization of the
   electric properties in terms of impedance towards application in neural
   tissues are shown. The printing toolkit developed enables processing of
   low-viscous, flexible polymeric thermal curing materials for fabrication
   of individualized neural implants.},

Title = {Screening for extractables in additive-manufactured acrylonitrile
   butadiene styrene orthopedic cast},
Journal = {TALANTA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {212},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {The use of additive-manufactured components in medical applications,
   specifically medical devices (e.g., orthopedic casts), has increased in
   recent years. Such devices may be fabricated at the point of care using
   consumer-grade additive manufacturing. Limited studies have been
   conducted to evaluate the extractable substances of these devices.
   Chemical characterization followed by toxicological risk assessment is
   one means of evaluating safety of devices. This study was designed to
   determine the extractables profile of additive-manufactured materials
   according to filament grade and post-processing method. Feedstocks for
   additive manufacturing were tested as filament and manufactured casts,
   while the cast from consumer-grade filament (CGF) was post-processed.
   Samples were extracted using three solvents of varying polarities.
   Extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)
   and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) techniques. In GC/MS
   analysis, isopropanol extracts generated fewer compound identifications
   for USP Class VI filament (USPF)-based casts (3) compared with the
   respective filament (17) while hexane generated the most compound
   identifications for the finished cast manufactured from CGF. CGF was
   found to have the highest number of nonvolatile extractables for
   isopropanol (15) and hexane (34) by positive ion LC/MS. Additionally,
   CGF produced more non-polar extractables in hexane than the USPF. A
   known polymer byproduct and potential genotoxicant, styrene
   acrylonitrile (SAN) trimer, was one of the compounds identified in both
   GC/MS and LC/MS at quantities ranging from 19 to 270 mu g g(-1). Overall
   these results suggested that the extractables profile was affected by
   the filament material, printing procedure, and post-processing method.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) enables time and cost savings in the product
   development process. It has great potential in the manufacturing of
   lighter parts or tools by the embedding of cellular/lattice structures
   that consume less material while still distributing the necessary
   strength. Less weight and less material consumption can lead to enormous
   energy and cost savings. Although AM has come a long way over the past
   25-30 years since the first technology was invented, the design of parts
   and tools that capitalize on the technology do not yet encompass its
   full potential. Designing for AM requires departing from traditional
   design guidelines and adopting new design considerations and thought
   structures. Where previous manufacturing techniques (computer numerical
   control (CNC) machining, casting, etc.) often necessitated solid parts,
   AM allows for complex parts with cellular and lattice structure
   implementation. The lattice structure geometry can be manipulated to
   deliver the level of performance required of the part. The development
   and research of different cell and lattice structures for lightweight
   design is of significant interest for realizing the full potential of AM
   technologies. The research not only includes analysis of existing
   software tools to design and optimize cell structures, but it also
   involves design consideration of different unit cell structures. This
   paper gives a solid foundation of an experimental analysis of additive
   manufactured parts with diverse unit cell structures in compression and
   flexural tests. Although the research also includes theoretical finite
   element analysis (FEA) of the models, the results are not considered
   here. As an introduction, the paper briefly explains the basics of
   stress and strain relationship and summarizes the test procedure and
   methods. The tests concentrate primarily on the analysis of 3D printed
   polymer parts manufactured using PolyJet technology. The results show
   the behavior of test specimens with different cell structures under
   compression and bending load. However, the research has been extended
   and is still ongoing with an analysis of selective laser melted test
   specimens in aluminum alloy AlSi10Mg.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates a new technology to create functionally graded
   material (FGM) by additive manufacturing (AM). In particular, this paper
   focuses on creating graphene-polymer composite FGM by laser-based
   sintering processes. Graphene-polymer composites have received high
   attention in AM due to their excellent electrical conductivity, thermal
   stability and mechanical strength. However, AM of the graphene-polymer
   composites has a huge challenge to overcome. The heterogeneous materials
   should be mixed properly, and it is not easy to achieve the desired
   composite characteristics solely by changing the mass ratio of graphene.
   This paper shows a newly developed laser-assisted AM system for the
   graphene-polymer composite FGM by laser-based sintering processes. The
   paper also describes two methods of material integration: mixing
   graphene and polyethylene powders before sintering, and depositing the
   different material powders separately and sintering them. This study
   identified that the two methods led to different mechanical and
   electrical properties of the created parts. Thus this paper demonstrates
   the possibility to create quite useful hybrid (mechanically and
   electrically) FGM composites.},

Abstract = {Recently 3D printing or additive manufacturing has been one of the most
   popular techniques for fabricating material. 3D printing or additive
   manufacturing has taken over the modern material fabrication industry in
   a revolutionary manner. The present review focuses on designing
   electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials by 3D printing.
   The various raw materials such as polylactic acid (PLA), polypropylene,
   graphene, carbon nanotube (CNT), multiwalled carbon nanotube (MCNT), and
   so forth, can be successfully used for making effective EMI shielding
   performances in different frequency ranges. These raw materials have
   prepared diverse shapes, dimensions, and compositions to attenuate the
   incident radiations over the shielding material's surface and ultimately
   protect the electronic devices. When mixed with carbon nanotubes, PLA
   has been shown 8-15 dB, 30 dB, and 67 dB EMI SE in different frequency
   ranges, a material with ABS and CNT have -3 to -16 dB reflection loss in
   X-band frequency. Also graphene nanofilm/MWCNT composition has shown EMI
   SE as high as 43-54 dB in X-band ranges when printed with poly jet
   printing. These properties gave a cutting-edge rivalry to the
   conventional fabrication method and proved that 3D printing is better
   when designing innovation for EMI shielding materials},

Title = {Evaluation of the influence of low pressure additive manufacturing
   processing conditions on printed polymer parts},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {21},
Pages = {404-412},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The properties of 3-D printed polymeric parts depend significantly on
   the processing conditions under which they are fabricated. This study
   aims to determine how the use of low-pressure additive manufacturing
   (AM) processing conditions, influences the mechanical performance of
   printed polymeric parts. This polymer material extrusion (PME) study was
   carried out using an open-source desktop printer, under both low
   pressure (1 Pa) and at atmospheric pressure. The printing study was
   carried out using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid
   (PLA) and a nylon co-polymer (PA6). The resultant polymer parts were
   compared based on their printed mass, density, volume, porosity, surface
   energy, ATR-IR analysis and thermal properties (DSC). As expected only
   minor differences in chemical functionality were observed between parts
   printed under the two processing pressures. Under low-pressure printing
   conditions, the polymer parts exhibited some physical changes, when
   compared to those, printed under atmospheric conditions, such as an
   increase in density and a decrease in porosity. This was observed in
   particular with the low-pressure printing of PA6 parts, which exhibited
   an increase in density from 1.095 to 1.113 g/cm(3) and a decrease in
   porosity by 8\%. Comparing low pressure printed type V dog bones (ASTM
   D-638), with those printed at atmospheric pressure, it was observed that
   the ABS, PLA and PA6 exhibited an increase in Ultimate Tensile Strength
   of 9\%, 13\% and 42\% respectively. It is proposed that the superior
   mechanical properties obtained for polymers printed under low pressure
   conditions, may be due to a combination of two factors. These are the
   reduction in porosity of the printed part and the reduction in heat loss
   at the printed polymer surface, yielding enhanced bonding between the
   polymer layers. In a further printing study carried out at atmospheric
   pressure in a nitrogen atmosphere, it was also demonstrated that any
   oxidation of the polymer layers during printing, did not significantly
   influence the mechanical properties of the resultant printed parts.},

Abstract = {In this paper, the use of electrophotographic polymer powder transfer
   for the preparation of multi-material layers is discussed with respect

   challenges of this task are considered verifying the critical process
   steps in order to develop a concept for an electrophotograhic laser
   sintering machine. On that basis, an experimental setup with a
   two-chamber design is realized which enables the investigation of the
   electrophotographic powder transfer at typical process conditions of
   SLS. Using this setup, transfer tests of polypropylene powder patterns
   were performed and qualitatively analyzed by photographic imaging. The
   results confirm the high potential of the application of
   electrophotography for multi-material powder deposition and show how a
   residual electrophotographic powder deposition can be achieved in
   general, which is independent from the already produced part height, in
   order to build up three-dimensional multi-material components. (C) 2018

Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING LETTERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A hydrogen reduction-based method for additive manufacturing of carbon
   steels from low cost and stable oxide powders is presented. This method
   uses materials extrusion processes to extrude inks composed of oxide
   powders, plastic binders, and solvents. Oxide powders are synthesized
   into viscous inks and extruded under ambient conditions into
   three-dimensional architectures. The three-dimensional printed green
   bodies are reduced at elevated temperatures in hydrogen-rich
   environments to burn off the polymer binder and reduce the oxide
   powders, yielding metal alloys with controlled compositions. While this
   approach has been demonstrated in previous publications for various
   alloys, the addition of carbon, an important element in most industrial
   steels, has been a persistent challenge. This paper demonstrates an
   approach to introduce carbon during the reduction process, resulting in
   through-thickness carburization of the final parts.},

Title = {Hybrid Manufacturing of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) via the
   Combination of Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing and Injection
   Molding},

Abstract = {Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) is a common thermoplastic polymer
   that has been widely employed in the manufacturing industry due to its
   impact resistance, tensile strength, and rigidity. Additive
   manufacturing (AM) is a promising manufacturing technique being used to
   manufacture products with complex geometries, but it is a slow process
   producing mechanically inferior products when compared to traditional
   production processes like injection molding (IM). Thus, our hybrid
   manufacturing (HM) process combining materials extrusion AM and IM to
   create a single article was investigated in this study, in which eleven
   batches of specimens were made and extensively tested. These include the
   AM, IM, and hybrid manufactured (HYM) samples, in which the HYM samples
   were made by inserting AM substrates into the IM tool and were varied in
   infill density of AM preforms and geometries. The HYM samples
   outperformed AM parts in terms of mechanical performance while retaining
   customizability dependent on the HYM processing parameters, and the best
   mechanical performance for HYM samples was found to be comparable to
   that of IM samples, implying that the overmolding process in HM had
   primarily improved the mechanical performance of AM products. This work
   leads to a deeper knowledge of applications to confirm the optimal
   component fabrication in high design flexibility and mass production.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper developed a multi-nozzle pneumatic extrusion-based additive
   manufacturing (AM) system and applied it to print multi-material
   polymers and conductive sensing pads. We used pneumatic extrusion
   nozzles to extrude the liquid material and then cured it by an
   ultraviolet (UV) light source. The multi-nozzle pneumatic
   extrusion-based additive manufacturing system mainly integrates both
   PC-based HMI and CNC controller to operate the three-axis motion and the
   extrusion flow control. Moreover, the peripheral I/Os include both
   positive and negative pressure and also the curing light source. A D/A
   controller is also applied to control the value of the pneumatic
   pressure. The coding part utilizes the numerical control software along
   with the PLC planning to operate the AM machine automatically. Our
   experiment is conducted by using Simplify3D, a commercial 3D printing
   slicing software. Different requirements were set for extrusion nozzles
   with different materials, and then we executed the path controlling
   G-code data by Python Language. Our system successfully prints
   multi-material polymer structure pads which include the hard and soft
   material pad fabricated in double-layers, triple-layers and also the
   grid structure. Finally, we find that the printed pad has conductivity.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has many advantages and became a valid
   manufacturing technique for polymers and metals in dentistry. However,
   its application for dental ceramics is still in process. Among dental
   ceramics, zirconia is becoming popular and widely used in dentistry
   mainly due to its outstanding properties. Although subtractive
   technology or milling is the state of art for manufacturing zirconia
   restorations but still has shortcomings. Utilizing AM in fabricating
   ceramics restorations is a new topic for many researchers and companies
   across the globe and a good understanding of AM of zirconia is essential
   for dental professional. Therefore, the aim of this narrative review is
   to illustrate different AM technologies available for processing
   zirconia and discus their advantages and future potential. A
   comprehensive literature review was completed to summarize different AM
   technologies that are available to fabricate zirconia and their clinical
   application is reported. The results show a promising outcome for
   utilizing AM of zirconia in restorative, implant and regenerative
   dentistry. However further improvements and validation is necessary to
   approve its clinical application.},

   Additively Manufactured Polymer Sensors},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {9},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {The current work experimentally determined how the initial resistance
   and gauge factor in additively manufactured piezoresistive sensors are
   affected by the material, design, and process parameters. This was
   achieved through the tensile testing of sensors manufactured with
   different infill angles, layer heights, and sensor thicknesses using two
   conductive polymer composites. Linear regression models were then used
   to analyze which of the input parameters had significant effects on the
   sensor properties and which interaction effects existed. The findings
   demonstrated that the initial resistance in both materials was strongly
   dependent on the sensor geometry, decreasing as the cross-sectional area
   was increased. The resistance was also significantly influenced by the
   layer height and the infill angle, with the best variants achieving a
   resistance that was, on average, 22.3\% to 66.5\% lower than
   less-favorable combinations, depending on the material. The gauge factor
   was most significantly affected by the infill angle and, depending on
   the material, by the layer height. Of particular interest was the
   finding that increasing in the infill angle resulted in an increase in
   the sensitivity that outweighed the associated increase in the initial
   resistance, thereby improving the gauge factor by 30.7\% to 114.6\%,
   depending on the material.},

Abstract = {Novel methodology to estimate the shape memory behavior of smart
   structure fabricated by additive manufacturing is presented by merging
   3D laser scanning and reverse engineering (RE). The specimens made from
   a temperature-stimulated smart material-PLA, is printed by fused
   deposition modelling (FDM), which adds the functionality of shape memory
   with additive manufacturing. Initially, to verify the estimation of
   shape memory behavior, standard rectangular samples are designed,
   printed, scanned and regenerated by RE. The results of the shape memory
   analyses are in close agreement with the previous works, which validate
   the methodology to be adopted from more complex geometries.
   Subsequently, the procedure is employed to the three-dimensional
   paraboloid surface for the development of surfaces during the different
   phases of the cycle. Successful rapid restoration of all the surfaces
   has been achieved with the accurate measurements which could be a
   time-consuming process using the conventional measurement techniques or
   involve high sophistication methodology. The shape recovery and shape
   fixity of the paraboloid surfaces are in congruence with the values
   calculated for the standard samples. RE models are also used to estimate
   the effect of stresses applied during the programming stage and
   subsequent release of internal stresses in the recovery stage above the
   glass transition temperature of PLA.},

Journal = {LASERS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2014},

Pages = {289-302},
Abstract = {Laser additive manufacturing (LAM), known also as laser sintering, is an
   additive manufacturing process where powder material is molten with
   laser beam layer by layer. From simple to very complex three-dimensional
   (3-D) geometries can be manufactured to solid components from metallic,
   ceramic, composite or polymer powder. Methods to control the process
   have started to gain an essential role in laser additive manufacturing
   processes. The objective of this study was to investigate laser additive
   manufacturing monitoring methods and find suitable method for detection
   and calculation of thermal features. The LAM process was monitored in
   situ simultaneously with pyrometer and active illumination system.
   Energy input and volumetric energy density were compared. for energy
   evaluation. In the study it was noticed that an increase in energy input
   to the range of 250 to 2000 J/m results in ball formation. Homogenous
   and non porous evenly distributed surface was achieved with energy input
   of 2500 J/m. Energy input of 5000 J/m showed interesting phenomena;
   layer formed is the most uniform of all results. However, some unevenly
   distributed porosity is noticed. It can be concluded that with energy
   input the heat penetration start decreasing to this semi molten surface
   of the stainless steel powder. At the same time, a denser surface with
   less balling phenomena was obtained. Collapse of surface was observed
   with energy input of 10000 J/m. Such behaviour with this energy input on
   stainless steel suggests lower heating impact what might be caused by
   lower absorption.},

Abstract = {Recently, additive manufacturing (AM) processes applied to the
   micrometer range are subjected to intense development motivated by the
   influence of the consolidated methods for the macroscale and by the
   attraction for digital design and freeform fabrication. The integration
   of AM with the other steps of conventional micro-electro-mechanical
   systems (MEMS) fabrication processes is still in progress and,
   furthermore, the development of dedicated design methods for this field
   is under development. The large variety of AM processes and materials is
   leading to an abundance of documentation about process attempts, setup
   details, and case studies. However, the fast and multi-technological
   development of AM methods for microstructures will require organized
   analysis of the specific and comparative advantages, constraints, and
   limitations of the processes. The goal of this paper is to provide an
   up-to-date overall view on the AM processes at the microscale and also
   to organize and disambiguate the related performances, capabilities, and
   resolutions.},

   amputation is also required for 9\% to 17\% of these patients within the
   same year although LEA may be preventable. Most of the diabetic foot
   conditions may be prevented and treated by a therapeutic footwear or a
   medical device such as an insole or an orthotic shoe. Traditional insole
   manufacturing is a laborious work that requires specific skills.
   Moreover, traditional approaches contain harmful material particles that
   may cause respiratory failure. Unfortunately, manufactured insoles may
   not be suitable for any mass-produced footwear in all cases. Therefore,
   patient requires to get insole-specific footwear. In this study, a
   diabetic insole was manufactured by means of a fused deposition
   modeling-(FDM) based system and a thermoplastic polymer. Biomechanical
   functionality was determined according to the applied polymer analysis
   on each produced sample and foam material. Subsequently, finite element
   analysis (FEA) was performed to target insole geometry to ensure the
   quality of the final medical product. Additive and traditional
   manufactured insoles are compared according to the cost and function. As
   a result, fabrication of an insole, based on the FDM method, was
   improved down to 8 h and 9 m. The weight of an insole prototype was
   74.74 g, and the material cost was \$3.44 while total cost of the
   traditional foam casting was determined as \$35.37 and weight of the
   insole was 72.6 g for this study. Consequently, benefits of the applied
   method are evaluated.},

Abstract = {Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is a versatile additive manufacturing
   technique for producing polymeric parts. Incorporating a foaming agent
   into the filament material enables the FDM-printing of thermoplastic
   foams, which opens up new possibilities for achieving desired mechanical
   property combinations. This study explored the process-property design
   space of FDM-printed polylactic acid (PLA) foams. Tensile and
   compression specimens were produced at a wide range of printing
   parameters using a commercial thermoplastic filament containing a
   foaming agent. Increasing the nozzle temperature and decreasing the
   filament feed rate increased the extent of foaming. Adjustment of the
   nozzle temperature, feed rate, and infill ratio controlled porosity over
   a density range of 0.24 to 1.17 g/cm3. Tuning of the mechanical
   properties over an order of magnitude was demonstrated, with elastic
   moduli ranging from 0.24 to 3.7 GPa and tensile strength ranging from
   4.2 to 34.5 MPa. The mechanical behavior closely followed the
   Gibson-Ashby model predictions. Foaming filaments provide a new tool for
   tuning the mechanical response of FDM-printed parts to achieve unique
   combinations of mechanical properties that are not attainable through
   conventional methods.},

Title = {A Comparative Study of Pellet-Based Extrusion Deposition of Short, Long,
   and Continuous Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Polymer Composites for
   Large-Scale Additive Manufacturing},

Abstract = {Pellet-based extrusion deposition of carbon fiber-reinforced composites
   at high material deposition rates has recently gained much attention due
   to its applications in large-scale additive manufacturing. The
   mechanical and physical properties of large-volume components largely
   depend on their reinforcing fiber length. However, very few studies have
   been done thus far to have a direct comparison of additively fabricated
   composites reinforced with different carbon fiber lengths. In this
   study, a new additive manufacturing (AM) approach to fabricate long
   fiber-reinforced polymer (LFRP) was first proposed. A pellet-based
   extrusion deposition method was implemented, which directly used
   thermoplastic pellets and continuous fiber tows as feedstock materials.
   Discontinuous long carbon fibers, with an average fiber length of 20.1
   mm, were successfully incorporated into printed LFRP samples. The
   printed LFRP samples were compared with short fiber-reinforced polymer
   (SFRP) and continuous fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) counterparts
   through mechanical tests and microstructural analyses. The carbon fiber
   dispersion, distribution of carbon fiber length and orientation, and
   fiber wetting were studied. As expected, a steady increase in flexural
   strength was observed with increasing fiber length. The carbon fibers
   were highly oriented along the printing direction. A more uniformly
   distributed discontinuous fiber reinforcement was found within printed
   SFRP and LFRP samples. Due to decreased fiber impregnation time and
   lowered impregnation rate, the printed CFRP samples showed a lower
   degree of impregnation and worse fiber wetting conditions. The
   feasibility of the proposed AM methods was further demonstrated by
   fabricating large-volume components with complex geometries.},

   composite structures: A study on manufactured tolerances},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {15},
Pages = {78-86},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Composite textiles have found widespread use and advantages in various
   industries and applications. The constant demand for high-quality
   products and services requires companies to minimize their manufacturing
   costs and delivery time in order to compete with general and niche
   marketplaces. Creation of molding and tooling options for advanced
   composites encompasses a large portion of fabrication time, making it a
   costly process and a restraining factor. This research discusses a
   preliminary investigation into the use and control of soluble polymer
   compounds and additive manufacturing to fabricate sacrificial molds.
   These molds suffer from dimensional errors due to several factors, which
   have also been characterized. The basic soluble mold of a composite is
   3D printed to meet the desired dimensions and geometry of holistic
   structures or spliced components. The time taken to dissolve the mold
   depends on the rate of agitation of the solvent. This process is steered
   towards enabling the implantation of optoelectronic devices within the
   composite to provide a sensing capability for structural health
   monitoring. The shape deviation of the 3D printed mold is also studied
   and compared to its original dimensions to optimize the dimensional
   quality to produce dimensionally accurate parts of up to 0.02\% error.

Journal = {ADVANCED MATERIALS},

Abstract = {The development of high-temperature structural materials, such as
   ceramics, is limited by their extremely high melting points and the
   difficulty in building complicated architectures. Four-dimensional (4D)
   printing helps enhance the geometrical flexibility of ceramics. However,
   ceramic 4D printing systems are limited by the separate processes for
   shape and material transformations, low accuracy of morphing systems,
   low resolution of ceramic structures, and their time-intensive nature.
   Here, a paradigm for a one-step shape/material transformation,
   high-2D/3D/4D-precision, high-efficiency, and scalable 4D
   additive-subtractive manufacturing of shape memory ceramics is
   developed. Original/reverse and global/local multimode shape memory
   capabilities are achieved using macroscale SiOC-based ceramic materials.
   The uniformly deposited Al2O3-rich layer on the printed SiOC-based
   ceramic lattice structures results in an unusually high flame ablation
   performance of the complex-shaped ceramics. The proposed framework is
   expected to broaden the applications of high-temperature structural
   materials in the aerospace, electronics, biomedical, and art fields.},

   concentrations (up to 90\%) of solid particle additives, including
   soda-lime glass, aluminum oxide, and copper powders, were mixed with the
   polymer and printed, which was difficult or impossible to realize using
   conventional injection molding or standard fused filament fabrication
   (FFF) 3D printing. Effects of laser melting/sintering parameters and
   manufacturing strategy of each type of polymeric composite were
   investigated. A successful delivery of very difficult-to-feed fine
   powder mixtures such as PA11/Al2O3 with irregular powder geometry via a
   new configuration of ultrasonic feeding was demonstrated. Three examples
   of 3D functionally graded components (part of a shoe sole, a turbine
   blade, and components of a ball bearing) were printed to illustrate the
   potential applications of the method.},

Abstract = {The advents in continuous fibre-reinforced polymer additive
   manufacturing (CFRP-AM) present unprecedented opportunities for the
   rapid development of next-generation high-performance composites with
   selectively and spatially distributed reinforcement. However, the widely
   adopted 3-degree-of-freedom motion configuration in current CFRP-AM
   systems hinders the exploration of composite structures with non-planar
   fibre layouts. This work presents a novel conformal CFRP-AM system to
   fabricate grid-stiffened shell structures leveraging its multi-DoF
   motion to pattern spatial features. The system integrates a 6-axis robot
   with an optimally designed co-extrusion module and operates through a
   design-to-manufacturing workflow. The proposed workflow includes three
   steps: system calibration, conformal toolpath generation, and process
   implementation. The conformal toolpath generation is a
   surface-mapping-based method that allows a simultaneous exploration of
   various geometric designs and their toolpaths. Experimental comparisons
   were made between parts fabricated by different processes, i.e., planar
   and conformal based, with different toolpaths, i.e., shells filled with
   zigzag and arc-offset patterns, and with various geometric designs,
   i.e., stiffener ribs with different crossline angles. The results
   manifest that the proposed system can significantly improve the
   compression strength and stiffness of grid-stiffened shell structures.
   Meanwhile, the additional design freedom on process and structure opens
   up a new possibility to customise their mechanical performance.},

Title = {Optimization of AZ91D Process and Corrosion Resistance Using Wire Arc
   Additive Manufacturing},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Progress on Additive Manufacturing (AM) techniques focusing on ceramics
   and polymers evolves, as metals continue to be a challenging material to
   manipulate when fabricating products. Current methods, such as Selective
   Laser Sintering (SLS) and Electron Beam Melting (EBM), face many
   intrinsic limitations due to the nature of their processes. Material
   selection, elevated cost, and low deposition rates are some of the
   barriers to consider when one of these methods is to be used for the
   fabrication of engineering products. The research presented demonstrates
   the use of a Wire and Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) system for the
   creation of metallic specimens. This project explored the feasibility of
   fabricating elements made from magnesium alloys with the potential to be
   used in biomedical applications. It is known that the elastic modulus of
   magnesium closely approximates that of natural bone than other metals.
   Thus, stress shielding phenomena can be reduced. Furthermore, the
   decomposition of magnesium shows no harm inside the human body since it
   is an essential element in the body and its decomposition products can
   be easily excreted through the urine. By alloying magnesium with
   aluminum and zinc, or rare earths such as yttrium, neodymium, cerium,
   and dysprosium, the structural integrity of specimens inside the human
   body can be assured. However, the in vivo corrosion rates of these
   products can be accelerated by the presence of impurities, voids, or
   segregation created during the manufacturing process. Fast corrosion
   rates would produce improper healing, which, in turn, involve subsequent
   surgical intervention. However, in this study, it has been proven that
   magnesium alloy AZ91D produced by WAAM has higher corrosion resistance
   than the cast AZ91D. Due to its structure, which has porosity or
   cracking only at the surface of the individual printed lines, the
   central sections present a void-less structure composed by an HCP
   magnesium matrix and a high density of well dispersed aluminum-zinc rich
   precipitates. Also, specimens created under different conditions have
   been analyzed in the macroscale and microscale to determine the
   parameters that yield the best visual and microstructural results.},

Abstract = {Herein, we proposed a novel laser assisted additive manufacturing (AM)
   methodology that utilizes prepreg composites (glass fiber-polypropylene)
   with continuous fiber reinforcement to fabricate 3D objects by
   implementing laser assisted bonding and laser cutting. The
   microstructure analysis demonstrated no visible void content and
   excellent interfacial bonding. The bonding strength of the proposed
   method was evaluated through lap shear strength and peel strength
   testing; resulting in 50\% higher peel strength than hot compaction
   method, with lap shear strength up to 96\% of compression molding
   benchmark data. Tensile properties of components printed by our method
   were superior to those of fused deposition modeling (FDM) printed short
   fiber composites with 300\% and 150\% of increase in tensile strength
   and modulus, respectively. Tensile strength of our printed components
   was comparable to compression molding and stamping, however, tensile
   modulus was 50\% lower in average. Flexural strength of the laser
   assisted AM parts was also in the range of stamping and compression
   molding methods, with flexural modulus up to 100\% higher than these
   methods. Overall, our proposed new technique offers an alternative
   direction in AM of continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic polymer
   composites to solve the issues associated with current techniques.},

Abstract = {Background: This review aimed to identify antimicrobial agents
   incorporated into den-tal materials obtained through additive
   manufacturing and their efficacy.Methods: Protocol registration was
   performed in Open Science Framework (osf.io/sp3xa/) and an electronic
   search was carried out in the databases PubMed, Science Direct, Embase,
   Lilacs, and Scopus, up to February 2022, combining the terms
   ({''}additive manufacturing{''} OR ``3D printing{''}) AND
   (antimicrobial). Eligibility criteria included: experimental studies
   that incorporated 3D print-ing material with an antimicrobial agent for
   dental application; that evaluated antimicrobial activ-ity; articles
   published in peer-reviewed journals and in English.Results: The database
   search resulted in 1139 references. The manual selection was carried out
   in 851 studies. Twenty-five articles were selected for full-text
   reading, of which 8 were included in this review. Polymers were the
   dental materials most often modified with antimicrobial agents for 3D
   printing, followed by metal alloy. The antimicrobials used were mainly
   nanoparticles, metal parti-cles, antifungals, monomers containing
   quaternary ammonium salt, and antiseptics such as
   chlorhexidine.Conclusion: The addition of the antimicrobial agents in
   polymers and alloy for additive manu-facturing showed promising efficacy
   against Candida spp., Gram-positive and Gram-negative bac-teria.(c) 2022

Abstract = {This study introduces the first steel micro fuel cells with enclosed
   channel flowfield made by laser additive manufacturing. These are also
   the first microfluidic devices with enclosed channels made from
   stainless steel by additive manufacturing. One important benefit of such
   fabrication methods is ultrafast prototyping, which we made use of in
   this study to optimize the performance of our fuel cells. The
   fabrication process consists of preparing a 3D model using a suitable
   computer-aided design software and then uploading the model file to the
   laser additive manufacturing machine. This process requires minimal
   manual intervention. The use of stainless steel as the fabrication
   material results in extremely durable, robust, chemically and thermally
   stable devices. Micro fuel cells with three different stainless steel
   flowfields were fabricated and characterized, two of which with enclosed
   channels, and one with traditional open grooves. Both enclosed channel
   flowfield fuel cells produced significantly higher power and current
   densities compared to the open groove counterpart: the maximum current
   density obtained was 1.515 A cm(-2) and maximum power density was 363 mW
   cm(-2). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a new digitally driven manufacturing process chain
   for the production of high performance, three-dimensional RF devices.
   This is achieved by combining Fused Filament Fabrication of
   polyetherimide based polymer with selective light-based synthesis of
   silver nanoparticles and electrochemical deposition of copper. The
   resultant manufacturing method produces devices with excellent DC
   electrical resistivity (6.68 mu Omega cm) and dielectric properties
   (relative permittivity of 2.67 and loss tangent of 0.001). Chemically
   modifying and patterning the substrate to produce the metallization
   overcomes many of the limitations of direct write deposition methods
   resulting in improved performance, adhesion and resolution of the
   antenna pattern. The fabricated demonstrators cover a broadband range of
   0.1 GHz-10 GHz and the measured results show a direct agreement with the
   simulated design over a wide frequency band. Overall the materials used
   as a substrate have a low relative permittivity and lower dielectric
   loss than FR-4, thereby making them well suited for antenna
   applications.},

Abstract = {Biodegradable polymer plays a major role in Additive Manufacturing (AM)
   technologies due to its novel characteristics that include its complete
   degradability and eco-friendly nature. The present research work aims to
   obtain smooth and stable Poly Lactic Acid (PLA)/Eggshell particles (E)
   composite filaments with enhanced mechanical and thermal properties for
   additive manufacturing applications. Composite filaments were developed
   by varying the ratio of E/PLA to 4-6-8-10-12 weight percentages (wt.\%)
   using a single screw extruder. A study of physical, chemical,
   mechanical, and thermal properties for the manufactured filaments was
   made. The extruded filaments were subjected to thermal analysis using
   Melt Flow Index (MFI) to obtain the optimum value for AM applications.
   XRD analysis made on 4 wt.\% eggshell revealed a higher crystallinity
   than neat PLA. The thermal results of neat PLA and various weight
   compositions of E revealed there is a decrease in thermal stability and
   thermal decomposition due to an increase in filler content. 4 wt.\% of E
   shows the good tensile strength of 49.29 MPa with smooth and stable
   E/PLA composite filaments during extrusion. The SEM images of the
   composites revealed the interaction between the filler and the matrix.
   Based on the experimental work, it is observed that the addition of
   eggshell powder into the PLA increases the mechanical properties with an
   optimum content of 4 wt.\% of E.},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to present a survey concerning the accuracy of
   thermoplastic polymeric parts fabricated by additive manufacturing (AM).
   Based on the scientific literature, the aim is to provide an updated map
   of trends and gaps in this relevant research field. Several technologies
   and investigation methods are examined, thus giving an overview and
   analysis of the growing body of research. Design/methodology/approach
   Permutations of keywords, which concern materials, technologies and the
   accuracy of thermoplastic polymeric parts fabricated by AM, are used for
   a systematic search in peer-review databases. The selected articles are
   screened and ranked to identify those that are more relevant. A
   bibliometric analysis is performed based on investigated materials and
   applied technologies of published papers. Finally, each paper is
   categorised and discussed by considering the implemented research
   methods. Findings The interest in the accuracy of additively
   manufactured thermoplastics is increasing. The principal sources of
   inaccuracies are those shrinkages occurring during part solidification.
   The analysis of the research methods shows a predominance of empirical
   approaches. Due to the experimental context, those achievements have
   consequently limited applicability. Analytical and numerical models,
   which generally require huge computational costs when applied to complex
   products, are also numerous and are investigated in detail. Several
   articles deal with artificial intelligence tools and are gaining more
   and more attention. Originality/value The cross-technology survey on the
   accuracy issue highlights the common critical aspects of thermoplastics
   transformed by AM. An updated map of the recent research literature is
   achieved. The analysis shows the advantages and limitations of different
   research methods in this field, providing an overview of research trends
   and gaps.},

Abstract = {Plastic packaging materials represent a new class of low-cost and
   sustainable additive manufacturing feedstocks. Recycled polyethylene
   terephthalate (PET) has been shown to be a robust material for material
   extrusion additive manufacturing, with mechanical properties comparable
   with acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene. However, due to PET's high
   crystallinity, it is generally a brittle material and can be subject to
   premature fracture. It is well known that the addition of rubbers can
   serve to toughen PET. In this work, micronized rubber powder, as well as
   non-reactive and functionalized styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene
   (SEBS) elastomers were compounded with recycled PET. Tensile strength
   was not significantly affected, but toughness increased 85\% with the
   addition of 5 wt\% rubber, 350\% with SEBS and over 550\% with maleic
   anhydride functionalized SEBS compared to neat recycled PET. Fracture
   surface analysis revealed evidence of ductile fracture and cavitation in
   the rubber toughened samples. Published 2020. This article is a U.S.

Abstract = {The hybrid laminar composite stack of carbon fiber reinforced polymer
   (CFRP) and titanium (Ti) are widely used in several critical engineering
   applications, including aerospace and automobile sectors. The joining of
   CFRP and Ti through conventional methods has several limitations such as
   weight additional, material damage, and lower fatigue life. Ultrasonic
   additive manufacturing (UAM) is a solid-state manufacturing process
   capable of joining layers of dissimilar materials. Experimental studies
   have successfully demonstrated the welding of CFRP and Ti through UAM
   process. However, there is a lack of understanding of the exact bonding
   process and influence of process parameter on weld quality during UAM.
   The present study investigates the bonding process and the effects of
   critical parameters in the UAM process of CFRP and Ti layers using
   finite element analysis and simulation technique. The simulation study
   reveals that the CFRP/titanium stacks encounter interfacial cyclic shear
   stresses and shear strains. The study found that the vibrational
   amplitude and surface roughness of the substrates play a critical role
   in achieving a proper weld. The simulation results are validated using
   experimentation. The finding of this study can help advance the
   commercialization of UAM process for welding dissimilar materials and
   composites.},

Title = {Predicting mechanical property plateau in laser polymer powder bed
   fusion additive manufacturing via the critical coalescence ratio},
Journal = {MATERIALS \& DESIGN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {201},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The state of the art in property-process relationships in the laser
   polymer powder bed fusion (LPPBF) subcategory of powder bed fusion (PBF)
   has derived relationships between the energy supplied and polymer
   thermal properties governing melting and degradation, so-called the
   ``energy melt ratio (EMR).{''} The EMR provides a framework for process
   parameter value selection based solely on melting behavior. However,
   coalescence, and not merely melting, is the basis for mechanical
   properties in LPPBF printed parts. The authors present a method for (1)
   predicting polymer coalescence based on transient temperature profiles
   resulting from a combination of LPPBF process parameter values and (2)
   connecting the predicted coalescence response to the observed onset of a
   plateau in mechanical properties. This work tests the hypothesis that
   the observed onset of a mechanical property plateau corresponds with a
   transition in consolidation physics. Complete coalescence must be
   achieved prior to the onset of physical gelation. For this work, in situ
   transient temperature profiles were obtained using infrared
   thermography. Coalescence prediction, via the Upper-convected Maxwell
   model, and physical gelation prediction, via Lauritzen-Hoffman and
   Avrami equations, were found to successfully identify LPPBF parameter
   combinations resulting in parts with density and tensile strength inside
   the plateau region. The hypothesis that the plateau occurs at the onset
   of closed pore morphology is supported.

Title = {Stereolithographic Additive Manufacturing of High Precision Glass
   Ceramic Parts},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Lithography based additive manufacturing (AM) is one of the most
   established and widely used 3D-printing processes. It has enabled the
   processing of many different materials from thermoplast-like polymers to
   ceramics that have outstanding feature resolutions and surface quality,
   with comparable properties of traditional materials. This work focuses
   on the processing of glass ceramics, which have high optical demands,
   precision and mechanical properties specifically suitable for dental
   replacements, such as crowns. Lithography-based ceramic manufacturing
   (LCM) has been chosen as the optimal manufacturing process where a light
   source with a defined wavelength is used to cure and structure ceramic
   filled photosensitive resins. In the case of glass ceramic powders,
   plastic flow during thermal processing might reduce the precision, as
   well as the commonly observed sintering shrinkage associated with the
   utilized temperature program. To reduce this problem, particular sinter
   structures have been developed to optimize the precision of 3D-printed
   glass ceramic crowns. To evaluate the precision of the final part,
   testing using digitizing methods from optical to tactile systems were
   utilized with the best results were obtained from micro computed
   tomography (CT) scanning. These methods resulted in an optimized process
   allowing for possible production of high precision molar crowns with
   dimensional accuracy and high reproducibility.},

Title = {Large-format additive manufacturing of polymer extrusion-based
   deposition systems: review and applications},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JAN 17},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) of polymer large parts is a technological
   research area with great growth potential if the main barriers to its
   implementation are successfully addressed. In this research, a review of
   large-format AM (LFAM) processes for polymers is presented, followed by
   market research concerning the identification of large-format polymer
   commercial printers. An overview was performed covering the current LFAM
   systems configurations and their control aspects. The design and
   modelling approaches related with the fabrication of polymer large parts
   by AM, and the materials currently being applied and under development,
   were described. Finally, a summary of LFAM applications with a focus in
   the Transportation, Academic, Construction and Energy sectors, was
   presented. The current main advances in the LFAM of polymers are linked
   with the possibility of producing large parts in a faster, cheaper, and
   reliable way. The market research analysis concerning results for all AM
   families involving polymer materials reveals that, currently, the
   material extrusion AM process family is potentially the most suitable to
   produce large parts, with a significant number of applications attesting
   its capability to produce such large-format components.},

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are gaining popularity due to their
   application in military, private, and public sector, especially being
   attractive for fields where human operator is not required. Light-weight
   UAVs are more desirable as they have better performance in terms of
   shorter take-off range and longer flight endurance. However, light
   weight structures with complex inner features are hard to fabricate
   using conventional manufacturing methods. The ability to print complex
   inner structures directly without the need of a mould gives additive
   manufacturing (AM) an edge over conventional manufacturing. Recent
   development in composite and multi-material printing opens up new
   possibilities of printing lightweight structures and novel platforms
   like flapping wings with ease. This paper explores the impact of
   additive manufacturing on aerodynamics, structures and materials used
   for UAV5. The review will discuss state-of-the-art AM technologies for
   UAVs through innovations in materials and structures and their
   advantages and limitations. The role of additive manufacturing to
   improve the performance of UAVs through smart material actuators and
   multi-functional structures will also be discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Title = {Load-Oriented Nonplanar Additive Manufacturing Method for Optimized
   Continuous Carbon Fiber Parts},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The process of the additive manufacturing (AM) of
   carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) parts based on the process of
   fused deposition modeling (FDM) has seen considerable research in recent
   years, which amplifies the importance of adapted slicing and
   pathplanning methods. In particular, load-oriented techniques are of
   high interest when employing carbon fiber materials, as classical
   methods, such as tape-laying and laminating, struggle with highly curved
   and complex geometries and require the costly production of molds. While
   there have been some promising propositions in this field, most have
   restricted themselves to a planar slicing approach, which severely
   limits the ability to place the fibers along stress paths. In this
   paper, a nonplanar slicing approach is presented that utilizes principal
   stress directions to construct optimized nonplanar constituting layers
   on which pathplanning can be carried out. These layers are oriented such
   that the effect of the weak interlayer adhesion is minimized. Support
   material is adaptively generated to enable the use of arbitrary part
   geometry. Furthermore, a continuous pathplanning method and
   post-processor are applied to yield manufacturing instructions. The
   approach is verified for its viability of application through
   experimental investigation on a multi-axis robotic 3D printer. This
   constitutes an important step in allowing the fabrication of CFRP parts
   to further utilize the possibilities of additive manufacturing.},

Abstract = {Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is close to be accepted as a production
   technique (Additive Manufacturing). However, one problem limiting
   employment of SLS for additive manufacturing in a wide-ranging
   industrial scope is the narrow variety of applicable polymers. The
   commonly applied SLS powder to date is polyamide 12 (PA 12). PA 12 or
   ccompounds of PA 12 (dry blends) are approximately 90 \% of complete
   industrial consumption. The remaining small quantity is distributed on
   polyamide 11 (PA11) and some other `exotic' polymers (TPU, PEBA,
   P(E)EK). Industry is awaiting commodity polymers like polypropylene (PP)
   or polyethylene (PE) crucial to open new market segments. But several
   approaches launching those polymers failed. But what are the reasons for
   the difficulties in developing new SLS powders? The contribution is to
   answer this and highlights the combination of intrinsic and extrinsic
   polymer properties necessary to generate a polymer powder promising for
   SLS application. Particle shape, powder distribution, thermal,
   theological and optical requirements must be considered and only a
   particularly controlled property combination leads to successful SLS
   implementation. Thermal behavior, particle shape and -distribution is
   discussed in detail, although the other properties can't be disregarded
   for providing new commercially successful SLS powder finally.},

Abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) is an upcoming technology used in the making
   of structural parts for space applications. This new technology uses
   primarily metallic materials like Ti6Al4V or aluminum alloys. The
   benefits are obvious: Due to the freedom of construction with
   AM-Technology, there is an enormous potential for mass reduction
   compared with parts made by traditional processes such as turning or
   milling.
   For further mass reduction, however, the use of polymers is becoming
   more and more in demand. The main challenges with using polymers are low
   mechanical strength and the outgassing of water and monomers that occurs
   in space. Metallizing these polymer parts by electroplating increase the
   mechanical strength of the polymers via the so-called sandwich effect. A
   dense metallic layer can also prevent the problem of outgassing from
   occurring.
   This paper will present the fundamentals of this idea and discuss the
   metallization of additive manufacturing polymer parts for space
   applications.},

   were inserted into the selective laser melting process. Due to the
   process influences, the inserted foreign particles were partially
   ablated by laser input or gas flow. The particles which remained in the
   final printed specimen's mi-crostructure were analyzed using optical
   microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed the
   influence of organic impurities in the Ti-6Al-4V structure. A new phase
   was formed, which can be distinguished from the surrounding martensitic
   titanium structure by its own structure and morphology.},

Title = {Bioprocess-Inspired Microscale Additive Manufacturing of Multilayered
   TiO<sub>2</sub>/Polymer Composites with Enamel-Like Structures and High
   Mechanical Properties},

Abstract = {Natural structure-forming processes found in biological systems are
   fantastic and perform at ambient temperatures, in contrast with
   anthropogenic technologies that commonly require harsh conditions. A new
   research direction ``bioprocess-inspired fabrication{''} is proposed to
   develop novel fabrication techniques for advanced materials. Enamel, an
   organic-inorganic composite biomaterial with outstanding mechanical
   performance and durability, is formed by repeating the basic blocks
   consisting of columnar hydroxyapatite or fluorapatite and an organic
   matrix. Inspired by the enamel formation process, a microscale additive
   manufacturing method is proposed for achieving a multilayered
   organic-inorganic columnar structure. In this approach, rutile titanium
   dioxide (TiO2) nanorods, polymers, and graphene oxide (GO) are
   sequentially assembled in a layer-by-layer fashion to form an
   organic-inorganic structure. In particular, GO serves as a substrate for
   TiO2 nanorods and interacts with polymers, jointly leading to the
   strength of the composites. Impressively, this enamel-like structure
   material has hardness (1.56 +/- 0.05 GPa) and ultrahigh Young's modulus
   (81.0 +/- 2.7 GPa) comparable to natural enamel, and viscoelastic
   property (0.76 +/- 0.12 GPa) superior to most solid materials.
   Consequently, this biomimetic synthetic approach provides an in-depth
   understanding for the formation process of biomaterials and also enables
   the exploration of a new avenue for the preparation of organic-inorganic
   composite materials.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing has many advantages over traditional
   manufacturing methods and has been increasingly used in medical,
   aerospace, and automotive applications. The flexibility of additive
   manufacturing technologies to fabricate complex geometries from copper,
   polymer, and ferrous materials presents unique opportunities for new
   design concepts and improved machine power density without significantly
   increasing production and prototyping cost. Topology optimization
   investigates the optimal distribution of single or multiple materials
   within a defined design space, and can lead to unique geometries not
   realizable with conventional optimization techniques. As an enabling
   technology, additive manufacturing provides an opportunity for machine
   designers to overcome the current manufacturing limitation that inhibit
   adoption of topology optimization. Successful integration of additive
   manufacturing and topology optimization for fabricating magnetic
   components for electrical machines can enable new tools for electrical
   machine designers. This article presents a comprehensive review of the
   latest achievements in the application of additive manufacturing,
   topology optimization, and their integration for electrical machines and
   their magnetic components.},

Abstract = {To enable the advancement of large-scale additive manufacturing
   processes, it is necessary to establish and standardize methodologies to
   characterize the mechanical properties of printed test coupons. Due to
   the large size of the print beads, conventional test standards are
   inadequate. The focus of this study was to determine the feasibility of
   using Digital image correlation (DIC) technology as a key enabler for
   robust data collection of strain measurements of large 3D printed parts.
   To incorporate the DIC measurements, a novel method was developed to
   prepare large 20\% (by wt.) glass filled ABS test coupons for adequate
   contrast. Through this technique, Poisson's ratio and elastic modulus
   were measured and stress strain curves were generated. The data produced
   by DIC correlated well with failure analysis performed on spent test
   coupons. Additionally, fracture surface analysis of the specimens
   revealed poor adhesion among the ABS matrix and glass fibers. This
   matrix/fiber debonding demonstrated the need for improved printing
   parameters to maximize tensile strength. Finally, critical length
   analysis of the fibers revealed them to be dimensionally inadequate.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing' (AM) refers to a class of manufacturing
   processes based on the building of a solid object from three-dimensional
   (3D) model data by joining materials, usually layer upon layer. Among
   the vast array of techniques developed for the production of
   tissue-engineering (TE) scaffolds, AM techniques are gaining great
   interest for their suitability in achieving complex shapes and
   microstructures with a high degree of automation, good accuracy and
   reproducibility. In addition, the possibility of rapidly producing
   tissue-engineered constructs meeting patient's specific requirements, in
   terms of tissue defect size and geometry as well as autologous
   biological features, makes them a powerful way of enhancing clinical
   routine procedures. This paper gives an extensive overview of different
   AM techniques classes (i.e. stereolithography, selective laser
   sintering, 3D printing, melt-extrusion-based techniques, solution/slurry
   extrusion-based techniques, and tissue and organ printing) employed for
   the development of tissue-engineered constructs made of different
   materials (i.e. polymeric, ceramic and composite, alone or in
   combination with bioactive agents), by highlighting their principles and

Abstract = {The additive manufacturing of natural fibre-reinforced polymers is a
   pivotal method in developing sustainable engineering solutions. Using
   the fused filament fabrication method, the current study investigates
   the additive manufacturing of hemp-reinforced polybutylene succinate
   (PBS) alongside its mechanical characterization. Two types of hemp
   reinforcement are considered: short fibres (max. length smaller than 2
   mm) and long fibres (max. length smaller than 10 mm), which are compared
   against non-reinforced (pure) PBS. A detailed analysis is performed
   regarding the determination of suitable 3D printing parameters (overlap,
   temperature, nozzle diameter). In a comprehensive experimental study,
   additionally to general analyses regarding the influence of hemp
   reinforcement on the mechanical behaviour, the effect of printing
   parameters is determined and discussed. Introducing an overlap in the
   additive manufacturing of the specimens results in improved mechanical
   performance. The study highlights that the Young's modulus of PBS can be
   improved by 63\% by introducing hemp fibres in conjunction with overlap.
   In contrast, hemp fibre reinforcement reduces the tensile strength of
   PBS, while this effect is less pronounced considering overlap in the
   additive manufacturing process.},

Title = {Design, additive manufacturing and component testing of pneumatic rotary
   vane actuators for lightweight robots},

Volume = {28},

Pages = {20-32},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to investigate the suitability of a multi-step
   prototyping strategy for producing pneumatic rotary vane actuators
   (RVAs) for the development of lightweight robots and actuation systems.
   Design/methodology/approach RVAs typically have cast aluminum housings
   and injection-molded seals that consist of hard thermoplastic cores and
   soft elastomeric overmolds. Using a combination of additive
   manufacturing (AM), computer numerical control (CNC) machining and
   elastomer molding, a conventionally manufactured standard RVA was
   replicated. The standard housing design was modified, and polymeric
   replicas were obtained by selective laser sintering (SLS) or PolyJet
   (PJ) printing and subsequent CNC milling. Using laser-sintered molds,
   actuator seals were replicated by overmolding laser-sintered polyamide
   cores with silicone (SIL) and polyurethane (PU) elastomers. The replica
   RVAs were subjected to a series of leakage, friction and durability
   experiments. Findings The AM-based prototyping strategy described is
   suitable for producing functional and reliable RVAs for research and
   product development. In a representative durability experiment, the RVAs
   in this study endured between 40,000 and 1,000,000 load cycles.
   Frictional torques were around 0.5 Nm, which is 10\% of the theoretical
   torque at 6 bar and comparable to that of the standard RVA. Models and
   parameters are provided for describing the velocity-dependent frictional
   torque. Leakage experiments at 10,000 load cycles and 6 bar differential
   pressure showed that PJ housings exhibit lower leakage values (6.8
   L/min) than laser-sintered housings (15.2 L/min), and PU seals exhibit
   lower values (8.0 l/min) than SIL seals (14.0 L/min). Combining PU seals
   with PJ housings led to an initial leakage of 0.4 L/min, which increased
   to only 1.2 L/min after 10,000 load cycles. Overall, the PU material
   used was more difficult to process but also more abrasion- and
   tear-resistant than the SIL elastomer. Research limitations/implications
   More work is needed to understand individual cause-effect relationships
   between specific design features and system behavior. Originality/value
   To date, pneumatic RVAs have been manufactured by large-scale production
   technologies. The absence of suitable prototyping strategies has limited
   the available range to fixed sizes and has thus complicated the use of
   RVAs in research and product development. This paper proves that
   functional pneumatic RVAs can be produced by using more accessible
   manufacturing technologies and provides the tools for prototyping of
   application-specific RVAs.},

Abstract = {Electromechanical, adhesion, and viscoelastic properties of polymers and
   polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) are of interest for additive manufacturing
   (AM) and flexible electronics. Development/optimization of inks for AM
   is complex, expensive, and substrate/interface dependent. This study
   investigates properties of free standing films of a thermoplastic
   polyurethane (TPU) polymer and an Ag-carbon black (Ag-CB) TPU PNC in a
   lightly loaded low strain compression contact as a rough measure of
   their suitability for AM. The TPU exhibited high hysteresis and a large
   viscoelastic response, and sufficient dwell time was needed for polymer
   chain relaxation and measurable adhesion. A new discovery is that large
   enough contact area is needed to allow longer time constant polymer
   ordering in the contact that led to higher adhesion and better
   performance/reliability. This has previously unknown implications for
   interface size relative to polymer chain length in AM design. The
   standard linear model was found to be a good fit for the viscoelastic
   behavior of the TPU. The PNC exhibited no adhesion (new result), low
   electrical resistance, and relatively small viscoelastic response. This
   implies potential for AM electrical trace as well as switch
   applications.},

Title = {A review on spacers and membranes: Conventional or hybrid additive
   manufacturing?},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {188},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Over the past decade, 3D printing or additive manufacturing (AM)
   technology has seen great advancement in many aspects such as printing
   resolution, speed and cost. Membranes for water treatment experienced
   significant breakthroughs owing to the unique benefits of additive
   manufacturing. In particular, 3D printing's high degree of freedom in
   various aspects such as material and prototype design has helped to
   fabricate innovative spacers and membranes. However, there were
   conflicting reports on the feasibility of 3D printing, especially for
   membranes. Some research groups stated that technology limitations today
   made it impossible to 3D print membranes, but others showed that it was
   possible by successfully fabricating prototypes. This paper will provide
   a critical and comprehensive discussion on 3D printing specifically for
   spacers and membranes. Various 3D printing techniques will be
   introduced, and their suitability for membrane and spacer fabrication
   will be discussed. It will be followed by a review of past studies
   associated with 3D-printed spacers and membranes. A new category of
   additive manufacturing in the membrane water industry will be introduced
   here, known as hybrid additive manufacturing, to address the
   controversies of 3D printing for membrane. As AM technology continues to
   advance, its possibilities in the water treatment is limitless. Some
   insightful future trends will be provided at the end of the paper. (C)

Title = {Design and Development of a Multi-Functional Bioinspired Soft Robotic
   Actuator via Additive Manufacturing},
Journal = {BIOMIMETICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The industrial revolution 4.0 has led to a burst in the development of
   robotic automation and platforms to increase productivity in the
   industrial and health domains. Hence, there is a necessity for the
   design and production of smart and multi-functional tools, which combine
   several cutting-edge technologies, including additive manufacturing and
   smart control systems. In the current article, a novel multi-functional
   biomimetic soft actuator with a pneumatic motion system was designed and
   fabricated by combining different additive manufacturing techniques. The
   developed actuator was bioinspired by the natural kinematics, namely the
   motion mechanism of worms, and was designed to imitate the movement of a
   human finger. Furthermore, due to its modular design and the ability to
   adapt the actuator's external covers depending on the requested task,
   this actuator is suitable for a wide range of applications, from soft
   (i.e., fruit grasping) or industrial grippers to medical exoskeletons
   for patients with mobility difficulties and neurological disorders. In
   detail, the motion system operates with two pneumatic chambers bonded to
   each other and fabricated from silicone rubber compounds molded with
   additively manufactured dies made of polymers. Moreover, the pneumatic
   system offers multiple-degrees-of-freedom motion and it is capable of
   bending in the range of -180 degrees to 180 degrees. The overall
   pneumatic system is protected by external covers made of 3D printed
   components whose material could be changed from rigid polymer for
   industrial applications to thermoplastic elastomer for complete soft
   robotic applications. In addition, these 3D printed parts control the
   angular range of the actuator in order to avoid the reaching of extreme
   configurations. Finally, the bio-robotic actuator is electronically
   controlled by PID controllers and its real-time position is monitored by
   a one-axis soft flex sensor which is embedded in the actuator's
   configuration.},

Abstract = {Phase change materials (PCMs) can enhance the performance of energy
   systems by time shifting or reducing peak thermal loads. The
   effectiveness of a PCM is defined by its energy and power density-the
   total available storage capacity (kWh m(-3)) and how fast it can be
   accessed (kW m(-3)). These are influenced by both material properties as
   well as geometry of the energy systems; however, prior efforts have
   primarily focused on improving material properties, namely, maximizing
   latent heat of fusion and increasing thermal conductivity. The latter is
   often at the expense of the former. Advanced manufacturing techniques
   hold tremendous potential to enable co-optimization of material
   properties and device geometry, while potentially reducing material
   waste and manufacturing time. There is an emerging body of research
   focused on additive manufacturing of PCM composites and devices for
   thermal energy storage (TES) and thermal management. In this article,
   the fundamentals and applications of PCMs are reviewed and recent
   additive manufacturing advances in latent heat TES for both the PCM
   composite and associated heat exchanger are discussed. A forward-looking
   perspective on the future and potential of PCM additive manufacturing
   for TES and thermal management is provided.},

Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {69},
Month = {MAY 5},
Abstract = {The crystalline structures and their spatial distributions of polyamide
   12 (PA12) parts processed by material extrusion additive manufacturing
   (MEAM) were studied in this work by means of microfocus wide-angle X-ray
   scattering combined with transmission electron microscopy. There are two
   types of gradient structures observed in the PA12 parts. One of the
   gradient structures is found in the topmost layer, where the total
   crystallinity drops gradually from the free surface to the core region
   further to the weld region. Moreover, the coexistence of alpha and gamma
   crystals is found in all regions. The gradient structure in the topmost
   layer arises from partial melting and chain relaxation occurring during
   the welding of the free surfaces between adjacent layers. Another
   gradient structure is that the crystallinity in PA12 parts demonstrates
   a gradual variation with decreasing the distance from the deposited
   layer to the platform, especially at a platform temperature above 60
   degrees C. Specifically, the bottom layer has much higher crystallinity
   than the top layer, with the middle layer in between, since the
   annealing effect of the hot platform gradually weakens from bottom to
   top due to the low heat conduction of PA12. This work provides a
   detailed insight into the crystallization mechanism of polyamide
   materials during MEAM process, which is meaningful for the manipulation
   of crystal structures in MEAM-printed semicrystalline polymers.},

Title = {Accelerating heat transfer modeling in material extrusion additive
   manufacturing: From desktop to big area},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {55},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Thermal modeling informs the understanding of cooling phenomena and
   structural evolution during material extrusion (MatEx) additive
   manufacturing to help predict and tune final part properties. For fused
   filament fabrication (FFF) and big area additive manufacturing (BAAM),
   in particular, thermal models are well-suited to augment parameter
   optimization and closed-loop control for high throughput manufacturing
   of custom parts and products. However, limitations in computational
   time, speed, and cost pose a challenge to modeling large structures with
   sufficient multi-dimensional granularity over extended timescales, with
   many models confined either to high-resolution studies on short length
   and timescales or low-resolution, lumped approximations for larger
   timescale simulations. Thus, the goal of this work is to develop a
   high-fidelity thermal model applicable from desktop to BAAM systems with
   minimal computational constraint.
   Here we present a scalable, 2D finite volume ``proof-of-concept `` model
   and algorithm to rapidly simulate thermal histories across both FFF and
   BAAM length and time scales. Our approach implements a two-dimensional
   implicit numerical strategy that confers reduced computational
   complexity while offering fine scale granularity in capturing critical
   inter- and intralayer cooling dynamics and radiative heat transfer.
   Further, analysis of the effective Biot number (Bi) reveals that, on the
   BAAM scale, layer width and radiative heat transfer both drive the
   formation of intralayer temperature gradients, exceeding 51 degrees C
   between the layer center and edge. We further simulate the fabrication
   of single road-width acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) walls at the
   BAAM scale (50 layers) to demonstrate both the relative speed of the
   computational approach and its ability to capture the complex dynamics
   of a multilayer build. The model agrees with published experimental
   measurements, and results gauge the influence of layer thickness and
   proximity to print bed on cooling behavior, with larger layers and
   separation from the print bed lending to longer periods for interlayer
   welds to form above the ABS glass transition temperature (T-g). Finally,
   a BAAM case study highlights the model's utility in design for additive
   manufacturing (DfAM) and print optimization, demonstrating how changes
   in bed temperature and layer time can impact interlayer bonding.},

Abstract = {A relatively new additive manufacturing machine called Freeformer was
   employed as an alternative to common Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF)
   machines. While FFF machines are fed with expensive and few commercially
   available filament feedstock, Freeformer is fed with cheap and common
   polymer pellets. In this study, more than 400 dumbbells made of
   Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) were processed varying many
   processing conditions to evaluate their impacts on the structure and so
   on, the mechanical properties of 3D parts. Among processing parameter,
   nozzle temperature, manufacturing chamber temperature, discharge
   parameters, filling density, raster geometry, slicing distance, number
   of contour lines, processing speed, filling raster-contour lines
   overlap, and processing angles were studied. Images obtained with a
   scanning electron microscope and 3D part density estimations reveal
   strong changes on the 3D part structure as a function of the processing
   parameters so that tensile tests exhibit high variations between the 3D
   part mechanical properties.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing of optical elements out of polymer allow new
   design concepts for optics. The parts are built up layer by layer.
   Unlike polymer binding with glass particles with its sintering process
   no secondary step is necessary for polymer printing to create the final
   part. With more and more printers and transparent materials available,
   this technology becomes more and more relevant for prototyping or custom
   optics. Therefor a deep understanding of the optical effects in the part
   is desirable. Key property of optical elements is the refractive index.
   The materials for polymer printing are most commonly resins that cure
   under UV-exposure and show lower refractive indices in liquid phase than
   cured. Assuming a dependency of the refractive index on the grade of
   polymerization and therefor the UV-exposure, the layering process of
   additive manufacturing causes variations of the refractive index within
   the part. Using the Scanning Focused Refractive Index Microscopy, the
   distribution of the refractive index within and between the layers is
   analyzed. The analysis includes comparisons between raw parts after
   printing and parts after UV post curing. Additionally, layer free
   samples from a Continuous Liquid Interface Printing System are examined
   for the homogeneity of the refractive index distribution.
   The purpose of the presentation is to give a detailed insight into the
   optical effects occurring at the layer interfaces of elements created by
   additive manufacturing. Possible use cases of the refractive index
   distributions within the part are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Purpose To compare the implant replica position accuracy on a duplicated
   complete edentulous maxillary implant definitive cast made either using
   conventional procedures or material jetting additive manufacturing (AM)
   technology using a coordinate measuring machine (CMM).
   Material and methods A complete edentulous maxillary cast with 6 implant
   replicas was prepared. The definitive cast was duplicated using two
   manufacturing procedures namely conventional (CNV group) and additive
   manufacturing procedures (AM group). On the CNV, an AM Co-Cr framework
   and a custom AM custom tray with a polyether impression material were
   used to obtain an impression of the definitive cast at room temperature
   (23 degrees C). On the AM group, the definitive cast was digitized using
   a laboratory scanner. The standard tessellation language (STL) file was
   exported and used to manufacture the polymeric AM specimens using a
   multijet printer following manufacturer ` s recommendations. A new
   digital implant replica was located on each corresponding housing of
   each AM specimen. A total of 10 specimens per group was obtained. A CMM
   was selected to measure the position of each implant replica on the
   definitive cast, CNV, and AM specimens. Linear and angular discrepancies
   were computed for each specimen. Thus, the Mann Whitney U test was used
   to analyze the data (p = 0.05).
   Results There was no significant difference in x-, y-, and z- linear and
   XZ angular discrepancy between both groups. However, the AM group
   revealed a significantly higher median YZ angular discrepancy than the
   CNV group (p = 0.007).
   Conclusions Material jetting AM technology demonstrated no significant
   difference in trueness and precision values of the linear and angular
   implant replica positions when compared to the conventional technique.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (or 3D printing) opens the possibility of
   creating new designs and manufacturing objects with new materials
   rapidly and economically. Particularly for use with polymers and polymer
   composites, simple printers can make high quality products, and these
   can be produced easily in offices, schools and in workshops and
   laboratories. This technology has opened a route for many to test ideas
   or to make custom devices. It is possible to easily manufacture complex
   geometries that would be difficult or even impossible to create with
   traditional methods. Naturally this technology has attracted attention
   in many fields that include the production of medical devices and
   prostheses, mechanical engineering as well as basic sciences. Materials
   that are highly problematic to machine can be used. We illustrate
   process developments with an account of the production of printer parts
   to cope with polymer fillers that are hard and abrasive; new nozzles
   with ruby inserts designed for such materials are durable and can be
   used to print boron carbide composites. As with other materials, complex
   parts can be printed using boron carbide composites with fine
   structures, such as screw threads and labels to identify materials.
   General ideas about design for this new era of manufacturing customised
   parts are presented.},

Abstract = {Electropolymerization of pyrrole is commonly employed to fabricate
   intrinsically conductive polymer films that exhibit desirable
   electromechanical properties. Due to their monolithic nature,
   electroactive polypyrrole films produced via this process are typically
   limited to simple linear or bending actuation modes, which has hindered
   their application in complex actuation tasks. This initiative aims to
   develop the specialized fabrication methods and polymer formulations
   required to realize three-dimensional conductive polymer structures
   capable of more elaborate actuation modes.
   Our group has previously reported the application of the digital light
   processing additive manufacturing process for the fabrication of
   three-dimensional conductive polymer structures using ultraviolet
   radiation. In this investigation, we further expand upon this initial
   work and present an improved polymer formulation designed for digital
   light processing additive manufacturing using visible light. This
   technology enables the design of novel electroactive polymer sensors and
   actuators with enhanced capabilities and brings us one step closer to
   realizing more advanced electroactive polymer enabled devices.},

Abstract = {This work reports the thermal, rheological, and crystallographic
   structural behavior of recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET)
   derived from bottle waste. The intent is to optimize it to an upcoming
   source for additive manufacturing by modulating its behavior using a
   chain extender triphenyl phosphite (TPP), nanofiller montmorillonite
   (MMT K-10), and catalyst antimony trioxide (Sb2O3). FT-IR (Fourier
   Transform Infrared) analysis showed an increase in absorbance due to the
   Sb2O3. The thermal analysis of the rPET using differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) ascertains a 10
   degrees C decrease in T-g with a substantial increase in the degradation
   onset of 7 degrees C due to MMT content. The melt flow index (MFI) study
   showed an increase with a similar range in intrinsic viscosity and
   weight average molecular weight (M-w) due to the additives. The
   percentage crystallinity, interlayer distance, and average crystallite
   size are determined and analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and DSC
   curves. The results are within the comparative range of both tests. The
   presence of Sb2O3 with higher MMT content showed agglomeration, and
   increased TPP showed low crystalline properties. These results provide
   that rPET can be altered to manufacture feedstock to suit different 3D
   printing techniques for prototyping.},

Title = {Using life cycle assessment to determine if high utilization is the
   dominant force for sustainable polymer additive manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Previous studies on the environmental impacts of polymeric additive
   manufacturing (AM) have shown that higher printer utilization
   dramatically improves impacts per part-so much so that it might dominate
   all other interventions if taken to an extreme. High utilization can be
   both temporal (printing constantly) and spatial (printing many parts at
   once). In this study, life cycle assessments (LCAs) were performed for
   an inkjet fusion printer with exceptionally high spatial utilization
   capacity and were compared to previous LCAs of nine printers printing
   with eight materials. Comparisons were performed in different
   utilizations, both temporal and spatial, to determine if high
   utilization reduces the environmental impact of AM more than other
   interventions, such as using sustainable print materials. For the inkjet
   fusion printer, maximum utilization dramatically reduced the
   environmental impact per part to less than 1\% of its impact in lowest
   utilization; this was below the impacts of other printers in low
   utilizations. However, when compared in the same utilization scenarios,
   the inkjet fusion printer still caused a higher environmental impact per
   part than almost all printers, primarily due to high energy use. The
   lowest-impact printer used both high spatial utilization and low-impact
   materials that also enabled a low-energy printing process. Therefore,
   printer utilization is not the overriding factor and must be combined
   with energy efficiency and material choice.},

Title = {An investigation of in situ impregnation for additive manufacturing of
   thermoplastic composites},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {64},
Pages = {972-981},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Due to the increasing popularity of additive manufacturing with
   continuous fibers thermoplastic composites (TPC), this paper
   investigates the process of in situ impregnation of dry fiber tow with
   molten thermoplastic resin as a means to reduce material cost. To better
   understand impregnation with high-viscosity polymer melts, a 1D version
   of Darcy?s Law is derived along with Gebart?s equations for estimating
   fiber tow impregnation and permeability. Rheology of the two polymer
   melts tested, nylon 6/12 and polycarbonate, were measured using a
   capillary viscometer. The experimental setup consisted of a heated and
   weighted plunger system to maintain polymer melt pressure in a
   temperature-controlled pultrusion chamber, through which a dry 3 K
   carbon fiber tow passes through at a constant velocity for in situ
   impregnation. The resulting TPC tape was collected on a reel and not
   used directly for AM. The setup allowed three process variables in
   Darcy?s equation, i.e. chamber pressure, polymer viscosity (via
   temperature), and exposure time, to be varied. The degree of
   impregnation of the thick tape specimens ? quantified using digital
   microscopy and image analysis on polished cross-sections ? matched
   theoretical predictions quite well (average errors of -10\% for nylon
   and -15\% for polycarbonate). However, despite pressures up to 1.2 MPa
   and exposure times (5.5-15 sec) consistent with current AM system feed
   rates, the extremely high melt viscosities (290?980 Pa?sec) make full
   impregnation of thick tapes nearly impossible in a practical setting.
   Improvements to the in situ impregnation process based on experimental
   results and impregnation models are suggested.},

Abstract = {This paper contributes a concurrent topological structure and

   process-induced material anisotropy through microscopic geometric
   modeling obtained by scanning electron micrographs. Numerical
   homogenization is performed to evaluate the equivalent effective
   properties of the 100-percentage cross-infilled local microstructures,
   and by introducing fitting functions, the relationship between
   equivalent effective material properties and varying cross-infill angles
   is empirically constructed. Then, optimization problems involving
   cross-infill angles as design variables are formulated, including
   concurrent optimization formulation. Numerical and experimental studies
   are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
   Both the numerical and experimental results demonstrate that the
   structural stiffness obtained by our proposed method has evidently

Title = {Large-scale additive manufacturing with bioinspired cellulosic materials},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {Cellulose is the most abundant and broadly distributed organic compound
   and industrial by-product on Earth. However, despite decades of
   extensive research, the bottom-up use of cellulose to fabricate 3D
   objects is still plagued with problems that restrict its practical
   applications: derivatives with vast polluting effects, use in
   combination with plastics, lack of scalability and high production cost.
   Here we demonstrate the general use of cellulose to manufacture large 3D
   objects. Our approach diverges from the common association of cellulose
   with green plants and it is inspired by the wall of the fungus-like
   oomycetes, which is reproduced introducing small amounts of chitin
   between cellulose fibers. The resulting fungal-like adhesive material(s)
   (FLAM) are strong, lightweight and inexpensive, and can be molded or
   processed using woodworking techniques. We believe this first
   large-scale additive manufacture with ubiquitous biological polymers
   will be the catalyst for the transition to environmentally benign and
   circular manufacturing models.},

Abstract = {A novel hybrid additive manufacturing (AM) technology combining digital
   light projection (DLP) stereolithography (SL) with 3D micro-dispensing
   alongside conventional surface mount packaging is presented in this
   work. This technology overcomes the inherent limitations of individual
   AM processes and integrates seamlessly with conventional packaging
   processes to enable the deposition of multiple materials. This
   facilitates the creation of bespoke end-use products with complex 3D
   geometry and multi-layer embedded electronic systems. Through a
   combination of four-point probe measurement and non-contact focus
   variation microscopy, it was identified that there was no obvious
   adverse effect of DLP SL embedding process on the electrical
   conductivity of printed conductors. The resistivity maintained to be
   less than 4 x 10(-4) Omega . cm before and after DLP SL embedding when
   cured at 100 degrees C for 1 h. The mechanical strength of SL specimens
   with thick polymerized layers was also identified through tensile
   testing. It was found that the polymerization thickness should be
   minimised (less than 2 mm) to maximise the bonding strength. As a
   demonstrator a polymer pyramid with embedded triple-layer 555 LED
   blinking circuitry was successfully fabricated to prove the technical
   viability.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing technology is suitable for producing
   energy-absorbing devices with tunable mechanical properties and improved
   crashworthiness performance. In this study, the mechanical properties
   and macrostructural crushing behaviour of five additively manufactured
   polymer-based honeycomb structures (HS) are investigated. Subjected to
   in-plane loading, the experimental results of the HS are compared with
   numerical findings and theoretical predictions. Results indicate that
   deformation modes and overall crushing performance are influenced by
   utilising different parent materials. The polymer HS made from
   polyethylene terephthalate glycol gives the best overall crushing
   performance over the other polymers and polymer-fibre reinforcement HS.
   However, the crush force efficiency of HS made from polylactic acid is
   the least promising. The polymer-fibre reinforced HS outperforms some of
   the pure polymer-based ones in terms of specific energy absorption and
   shows a characteristic lightweight advantage. Hence, spotting it as a
   promising energy absorber utilised for crashworthiness application
   especially where ultra-lightweight property is highly desired.},

Abstract = {This work describes the use of deposition-based additive manufacturing
   (AM) techniques to fabricate air-cooled, two-fluid heat exchangers. The
   project focused on a Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning
   application and used an industry-standard copper/aluminum heat exchanger
   manufactured with conventional technology as the basis for assessing
   performance. The manufacturing constraints associated with using
   deposition-based AM technology for this application include the need for
   a continuous tool path within each build layer that allows uninterrupted
   extrusion and therefore defect-free water channel walls that correspond
   to a reliably leak-tight heat exchanger. A geometry that respects these
   constraints was developed, simulated, optimized and finally manufactured
   and tested. The material used was a composite of polymer filled with
   conductive flakes in order to provide high conductivity in the direction
   that heat must flow in this heat exchanger, across the wall separating
   the fluids. The measured performance for several test coupons matched
   the predicted performance and the test coupons exhibited performance
   that approach and in some cases exceeds conventional technology},

Title = {X-ray computed tomography evaluations of additive manufactured
   multimaterial composites},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MICROSCOPY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {285},
Number = {3, SI},
Pages = {131-143},

Abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) often produces complex engineered structures
   by precisely distributing materials in a layer-by-layer fashion.
   Multimaterial AM is a particularly flexible technique able to combine a
   range of hard and soft materials to produce designed composites.
   Critically, the design of AM multimaterial structures requires the
   development of precise three-dimensional (3D) computed aided design
   (CAD) files. While such digital design is heavily used, techniques able
   to validate the physically manufactured composite against the digital
   design from which it is generated are lacking for AM, especially as any
   evaluations must be able to distinguish material variation across the 3D
   space. Nowadays, there is a growing interest in volumetric tools that
   can provide topological information hidden by the surface of shaped
   materials. So far, technologies such as Optical microscopy (OM),
   Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Coordinate Measuring Machine
   (CMM) have paved the way into the metrology field to measure the
   external geometry of physical objects. Currently, alongside conventional
   metrology tools, X-ray computed tomography (XCT) is emerging to measure
   the subsurface of the objects but maintaining the integrity of the
   probed samples. Thereby, the volumetric nature of the XCT investigations
   and its associated imaging techniques, ensure 3D quantitative
   measurements comparable to the output data from 2D metrology tools, but
   above all, supply the missing subsurface description for an exhaustive
   metrology study. The reward associated with XCT applied to multimaterial
   AM is a map reflecting the fabricated distribution of materials
   following CAD, with the benefits of better understanding the mechanical
   interplay within phases, hence, describing the hidden processes as well
   as the changes in phases due to a range of mechanical or chemical
   phenomena. In this study, a nondestructive approach using X-ray computed
   tomography (XCT) is used to fully evaluate the 3D distribution of
   multimaterials from an AM process. Specifically, two diverse hard and
   soft materials are alternatively produced in the form of a fibre
   embedded in a matrix via ink-jet printing. XCT coupled with imaging
   evaluation were able to distinguish between the differing materials and,
   importantly, to demonstrate a reduction in the expected fabricated
   volumes when compared to the respective CAD designs.
   Lay description Additive Manufacturing (AM) has recently become
   important in producing complex engineered structures. Using 3D CAD files
   and/or reconstructed data sets from imaging, hard and soft materials are
   manufactured independently or in combination, according to geometrical
   features and shapes in the input data. However, the evaluation of the
   resultant manufactured parts in comparison with the original 3D drawing
   is currently lacking. In this sense, X-ray computed tomography (XCT)
   provides an important metrology tool for mono and multimaterial AM. In
   this work a volumetric metrology investigation is proposed using higher
   resolution XCT to provide 3D information comparable to that of the 3D
   CAD drawings. A commercial high-resolution multijetting material printer
   (ProJet 5500X, 3D Systems, USA) is used to manufacture single fibre
   composites, through a complementary deposition of photo sensible
   polymers. Hard and soft plastics are produced using a UV curable step,
   resulting in materials of similar attenuation under an X-ray probe.
   A critical aim of the evaluations is the potential for XCT to
   distinguish between different UV curable 3D printing materials.},

Abstract = {Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites have been used
   extensively in the aerospace and automotive industries due to their high
   strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios. Compared with
   conventional manufacturing processes for CFRP, additive manufacturing
   (AM) can facilitate the fabrication of CFRP components with complex
   structures. While AM offers significant advantages over conventional
   processes, establishing the structure-property relationships in
   additively manufactured CFRP remains a challenge because the mechanical
   properties of additively manufactured CFRP depend on many design
   parameters. To address this issue, we introduce a data-driven modeling
   approach that predicts the flexural strength of continuous carbon
   fiber-reinforced polymers (CCFRP) fabricated by fused deposition
   modeling (FDM). The predictive model of flexural strength is trained
   using machine learning and validated on experimental data. The
   relationship between three structural design factors, including the
   number of fiber layers, the number of fiber rings as well as polymer
   infill patterns, and the flexural strength of the CCFRP specimens is
   quantified.},

Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {By using filaments comprising metal or ceramic powders and polymer
   binders, solid metal and ceramic parts can be created by combining
   low-cost fused filament fabrication (FFF) with debinding and sintering.
   In this work, we explored a fabrication route using a FFF filament
   filled with 316 L steel powder at 55 vol.-\%. We investigated the
   printing, debinding and sintering parameters and optimized them with
   respect to the mechanical properties of the final part. Special focus
   was placed on debinding and sintering in order to obtain components of
   low residual porosity. Solvent debinding of the printed green bodies
   created an internal network of interconnected pores and was followed by
   thermal debinding. Thermal debinding allowed for complete removal of the
   remaining binder and produced mechanically stable brown parts. Sintering
   at 1360 degrees C provided densification of the parts and generated
   nearly isotropic linear shrinkage of about 20\%. Using optimized
   parameters, it was possible to fabricate 316 L steel components with a
   density greater than 95\% via the material extrusion additive
   manufacturing, debinding and sintering route, with achievable
   deflections in a 3-point bending test similar to rolled sheet material,
   albeit at lower strength.},

   electronics with additive manufacturing. This review primarily focuses
   on the prospective developments in convergence with flexible electronics
   manufacturing technologies. Specifically, this paper covers the latest
   3D printing and hybrid manufacturing technologies, the utility of
   specific types of materials, their functionalization and
   characterization, post-processing and testing strategies toward
   fabricating robust and application-specific flexible electronics.
   Besides exploring the advances in this area of research-it also
   highlights the limitations and gaps that have been observed in the
   previous years that will challenge and offer opportunities for advancing

Title = {Development of Weather-Resistant 3D Printed Structures by Multi-Material
   Additive Manufacturing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, has had a big impact on the
   manufacturing world through its low cost, material recyclability, and
   fabrication of intricate geometries with a high resolution.
   Three-dimensionally printed polymer structures in aerospace, marine,
   construction, and automotive industries are usually intended for service
   in outdoor environments. During long-term exposures to harsh
   environmental conditions, the mechanical properties of these structures
   can be degraded significantly. Developing coating systems for 3D printed
   parts that protect the structural surface against environmental effects
   and provide desired surface properties is crucial for the long-term
   integrity of these structures. In this study, a novel method was
   presented to create 3D printed structures coated with a
   weather-resistant material in a single manufacturing operation using
   multi-material additive manufacturing. One group of specimens was 3D
   printed from acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) material and the
   other group was printed from ABS and acrylic-styrene-acrylonitrile (ASA)
   as a substrate and coating material, respectively. The uncoated ABS
   specimens suffered significant degradation in the mechanical properties,
   particularly in the failure strain and toughness, during exposure to UV
   radiation, moisture, and high temperature. However, the ASA coating
   preserved the mechanical properties and structural integrity of ABS 3D
   printed structures in aggressive environments.},

Title = {Uncertainty quantification in dimensions dataset of additive
   manufactured NIST standard test artifact},
Journal = {DATA IN BRIEF},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {38},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The printed features on an additive manufactured part will often deviate
   from the nominal values of the 3D model's features due to the factors
   such as printer resolution, printing parameters, printing technology,
   and the measurement method. The National Institute of Standards and
   Technology (NIST) standard test artifact contains a collection of
   various features that can be used to characterize a 3D printer's
   performance and has been used to benchmark metal printers. There is
   limited documentation on how well different additive manufacturing
   processes can fabricate the NIST artifact. This dataset records the
   dimensional uncertainty of selective printed features of the NIST
   artifact manufactured with polymer and resin printing processes. It
   contains the post-processing dimensional measurements of geometric
   features on the printed test artifacts. In order to generate the data, a
   total of 16 samples of the test artifact were printed with fused
   deposition modelling (FDM) and stereolithography (SLA) additive
   manufacturing methods. The percentage error between the measurement of
   features in the printed samples and their nominal computer aided design
   (CAD) values are calculated. For future reusability of this data, the
   same NIST test artifact CAD model can be printed, and the features'
   measurements can be compared with the dataset presented in this article.

Title = {Realisation of acoustic black holes using multi-material additive
   manufacturing},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {DEC 12},
Abstract = {Acoustic black holes (ABHs) have been widely accepted as an effective
   passive vibration control technique, with multiple configurations
   investigated for different applications. However, traditional
   manufacturing techniques may limit the potential geometries and
   configurations of the ABH. For example, the required damping layer has
   to be applied to the surface of the ABH taper rather than being embedded
   throughout or within the taper. In addition, conventional subtractive
   manufacturing is particularly wasteful for the realisation of ABHs,
   which rely on the removal of material to create a tapering structure.
   Therefore, in this work, we investigate the use of multi-material
   additive manufacturing as a potential solution, which avoids waste
   material in the manufacturing process and is capable of realising
   complex geometries, such as enclosing one material inside another. An
   ABH taper in a beam termination application has been implemented using
   polymer multi-material inkjet printing. The additively manufactured ABH
   was modelled using finite element analysis, before being manufactured
   and experimentally tested to enable an investigation of the vibration
   attenuation capabilities of such an ABH realisation.},

Abstract = {Do extrusion temperature, printing speed, and layer time affect
   mechanical performance of interlayer bonds in material extrusion
   additive manufacturing (MEAM)? The question is one of the main
   challenges in 3D printing of polymers. This article aims to analyze the
   independent effect of printing parameters on interlayer bonding in MEAM.
   In previous research, printing parameters were unavoidably interrelated,
   such as printing speed and layer cooling time. Here, original specimen
   designs allow the effects to be studied independently for the first time
   to provide new understanding of the effects of a wide range of thermal
   factors on mechanical properties of 3D-printed polylactide. The
   experimental approach used direct GCode design to manufacture specially
   designed single-filament-thick specimens for tensile testing to measure
   mechanical and thermal properties normal to the interface between
   layers. In total, five different extrusion temperatures (a range of 60
   degrees C), five different printing speeds (a 16-fold change in the
   magnitude) and four different layer times (an 8-fold change) were
   independently studied. The results demonstrate interlayer bond strength
   to be equivalent to that of the bulk material within experimental
   scatter. This study provides strong evidence about the crucial role of
   microscale geometry for apparent interlayer bond strength relative to
   the role of thermal factors. By designing specimens specifically for the
   MEAM process, this study clearly demonstrates that bulk-material
   strength can be achieved for interlayer bonds in MEAM even when printing
   parameters change severalfold. Widespread industrial and academic
   efforts to improve interlayer bonding should be refocused to study
   extrusion geometry-the primary cause of anisotropy in MEAM.},

Abstract = {In this work, a high thermal conductivity (TC) sample is prepared by
   extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM). Polyurethane/polylactide
   (TPU/PLA) is chosen as the matrix material, and hexagonal boron nitride
   (h-BN) acts as the filler. Although the loading of h-BN is fixed at 30
   wt\%, the TC values can shift from 0.63 to 1.80 W m K, which shows the
   importance of processing control. The influences of filler size, filler
   system, and process strategy are discussed systematically. This work
   provides some new ideas in preparing high TC polymer composite. The
   sample can be potentially utilized at some conditions which need rapid
   prototyping, good thermal conductivity, and good ductility.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {As one of the most important categories in the additive manufacturing
   (AM) field, powder-based techniques, such as selective laser sintering,
   electron beam melting and selective laser melting, utilize laser or
   electronic beams to selectively fuse polymeric, metallic, ceramic or
   composite powders layer-by-layer into desired products according to
   their computer-aided design models. With unique mechanical, thermal,
   electrical, biocompatible and fire-retardant properties, polymeric
   composite materials for powder-based AM have been attracting intensive
   research interests because of their potential for a wide variety of
   functional applications in aerospace, automobile, marine and offshore,
   medical and many other industries.
   This article provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on
   polymeric composite materials, their powder preparation for AM, and
   functionalities and applications of their printed products. It begins
   with the introduction of thermoplastic polymers that have been used as
   the main matrices of the polymeric composites and various composite
   reinforcements such as metallic, ceramic, carbon-based fillers and
   polymer blends for strengthening and functionality purposes. Discussion
   is then made on the processes for manufacturing such polymeric
   composites into powder form, which include shear pulverization,
   solution-based methods and melt compounding methods, with a focus on
   their advantages, limitations and challenges in terms of their
   productivity and processibility as well as powder printability.
   Thereafter, the properties and functionalities of the printed products
   and their various intriguing applications particularly in biomedical
   (anatomical models, tissue engineering and drug delivery), aerospace,
   automobile, military, energy and environmental, acoustic devices and
   sports equipment are highlighted. Finally, this review is concluded with
   an outlook on polymeric composites for powder-based AM, new
   opportunities, major challenges and possible solutions. (C) 2018

Abstract = {The development of a flexible surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor as
   microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) device has been gradually emerged
   due to its unobtrusive size, passive, and wireless competencies. The
   concept behind this work is to additively develop a flexible surface
   acoustic wave (SAW) device with enhanced electromechanical properties
   capable of detecting mechanical strain occurring in aerospace
   applications. The nanocomposite substrate is made of polyvinylidene
   fluoride (PVDF) owing to its flexibility, piezoelectricity, long-term
   stability, and easy processing incorporated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
   as nanofillers. Adding CNTs to the polymer matrix for electromechanical
   properties enhancement is investigated through additive manufacturing
   (AM) process. Both the thin substrate and the interdigital transducer
   (IDT) are fabricated through direct digital manufacturing (DDM),
   exhibiting favorable piezoelectric and electrical properties. Various
   device characteristics of fabricated SAW sensor, including the
   generation and propagation of Rayleigh waves and the changes in wave
   characteristics, such as frequency, admittance, and impedance, are
   discussed in this paper. The effects of IDT dimensions and the resonant
   frequency response of the developed SAW device are also examined with
   numerical analysis.},

Abstract = {Additive Manufacturing, often known as 3D printing, is a process that
   uses a variety of materials to manufacture highly accurate items layer
   by layer. However, this technology has its limitations. One such
   limitation is the inability to print components larger than the
   printer's size due to the limited size of the build chamber. 4D additive
   manufacturing or 4D printing is an innovative development based on 3D
   printing that allows objects to be reshaped after printing, using
   stimuli-responsive materials that require external stimuli. This article
   present a review on 4D printing. Four databases, Google Scholar,
   ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus database, were systematically
   searched for relevant review articles to identify and classify research
   studies. Specific keywords (4D printing, additive manufacturing, smart
   materials, stimuli, and application) were identified and used to guide
   the discovery of relevant studies. A total of 28 full articles were
   reviewed to study the applications of 4D printing, smart materials for
   4D printing, as well as the effect of various stimuli on 4D printed
   objects. In conclusion, this review gives a summary of 4D printing and
   highlights its potential for revolutionizing manufacturing and further
   research is required to solve the limitations posed by this technology.},

Title = {Design of a low-cost, high-temperature inverted build environment to
   enable desktop-scale additive manufacturing of performance polymers},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {33},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A heated build environment in Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) additive
   manufacturing (AM) is used to promote layer bonding in printed parts and
   reduce the difference in temperature between the extrusion and
   environment decreasing the shrinkage, residual stresses, and part
   deformation. A build environment capable of maintaining a
   high-temperature (> 200 degrees C) is often required to enable
   high-quality FFF printing of high-glass-transition, high-performance
   polymers such as nylon, PPSF, and ULTEM. Industrial-scale AM systems are
   capable of printing such polymers, as they offer a controlled,
   high-temperature printing environment; however, the machine cost often
   exceeds > \$100,000. High-temperature printers are now available and at
   lower costs; however, the cost is still expensive (similar to \$30,000).
   Many of these printers use bed heating rather than controlled
   environment heating, which can lead to inhomogeneous heat transfer and
   inconsistent properties. The key barrier to offering high-temperature
   environments for desktop-scale FFF systems in a cost-effective manner is
   that the electrical components must be compatible with, protected from,
   or removed from environments exceeding 100 degrees C.
   To enable desktop-scale FFF printing of high-performance polymers at a
   low cost and high quality, the authors present a novel inverted FFF
   system design that provides a build environment of up to 400 degrees C.
   The inverted configuration effectively isolates the system electronics
   from the heated build environment, which allows for the use of
   inexpensive components. In this paper, the authors verify the inverted
   design concept analytically via a computational fluid dynamics model.
   The concept is then experimentally validated via a comparison of the
   strength of PPSF components printed on the inverted desktop-scale FFF
   system.},

Abstract = {Fabrication of 3D dielectric photonic crystals in the visible and in the
   infrared range typically requires sub-micron structural features and
   high-refractive index materials. We developed a template-free additive
   manufacturing (AM) process based on direct laser writing (DLW) that can
   create complex 3D architectures out of titania (TiO2) with similar to
   100 nm resolution. In this process, we synthesize hybrid
   organic-inorganic materials that contain titanium clusters coordinated
   with acrylic ligands to prepare a photoresist that is amenable to
   two-photon lithography (TPL). We sculpt a pre-ceramic architecture using
   TPL and then pyrolyze in air at 900 degrees C to remove the organic
   constituents to produce a replica of the original structure with similar
   to 70\% reduced linear dimensions. Energy-Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS)
   and Raman spectroscopy confirm the constituent solid to consist
   predominantly out of rutile titania.
   We demonstrate this process by fabricating titania woodpile structures
   with lateral dimensions of 70 x 70 mu m and lateral periodicities
   between 1.0 and 1.3 mu m. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
   reveals passive tuning of the reflectance peak between 1.7 and 2.3 mu m,
   which agrees with Plane Wave Expansion simulations. This titania AM
   process offers a promising pathway to efficiently fabricate complex 3D
   nano-architectures out of a high-index material for 3D dielectric
   photonic crystals in the visible and the infrared.},

Abstract = {In lithography-based additive manufacturing, mostly crosslinking
   monomers with acrylate functionality are applied, which yield brittle
   materials with inhomogeneous network architectures. The toughening of
   state-of-the-art materials is an integral requirement for the
   advancement of photopolymer-based three-dimensional (3D) products. Here
   we show that the final material properties of acrylate networks can be
   adjusted through regulation of the radical curing mechanism using
   difunctional vinyl sulfonate esters to obtain toughened 3D structured
   materials. A substantial improvement of the thermomechanical behavior of
   resulting materials over materials regulated by state-of-the-art
   reagents (e.g. thiols) is presented and first 3D parts have successfully
   been printed. Resulting materials exhibit reduced shrinkage stress,
   reduced warpage, higher overall conversion and higher glass transition
   temperatures compared with the pure acrylate network. (c) 2022 The

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) of polymer-based composites in the
   automotive industry has enjoyed tremendous progress in recent times. The
   use of this manufacturing technique has made it possible for the
   manufacturing of cost-effective, single, complex and customized
   automotive components. Of all the available additive manufacturing
   techniques, stereolithography (SLA), selective laser sintering (SLS),
   fused deposition modelling (FDM), laminated object manufacturing (LOM)
   and inkjet are the most used in the creation of polymer composite parts
   in the automotive industry. In spite of the success recorded in the use
   of AM of polymer composites in the automotive industry, the technology
   is limited by the size and quantity of parts produced as some of the
   components are massive in size and often requires mass production.
   Hence, AM should be a complement and not a replacement to traditional
   manufacturing methods in the automotive industry. In this review, the
   progress made and some of the challenges that are associated with the
   use of AM of polymer-based composites in the automotive industry are
   presented.},

Abstract = {Material jetting is an additive manufacturing technique that allows to
   produce three-dimensional solid parts without tooling and with minimum
   material wastage. In this context, magnetically loaded polymer
   composites with oriented magnetic particles are promising for many
   electrical and electronic applications. In this study, permanent magnet
   based alignment configurations were evaluated and compared in terms of
   different magnetic flux density using the finite element method. The
   particle alignment in cured droplet specimens and the stability of
   magnetically loaded polymer droplets deposited on a substrate were
   characterized for a material jetting based additive manufacturing
   process. Particle alignment and droplet deformation under the influence
   of the magnetic field was captured using real-time optical microscopy.
   The influence of rheological additives in controlling droplet stability
   in the magnetic field and mitigating particle settling were studied
   through experiments. The primary goal of this research was to identify
   parameters that facilitate high particle alignment, and material
   combinations that enhance droplet stability and mitigate particle
   settling. This fundamental research serves to enhance the understanding
   of processes and material behaviour for material jetting based additive
   manufacturing.},

Abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) printing or Additive Manufacturing (AM)
   technology is an innovative tool with great potential and diverse
   applications in various fields. As 3D printing has been burgeoning in
   recent times, a tremendous transformation can be envisaged in medical
   care, especially the manufacturing procedures leading to personalized
   medicine. Stereolithography (SLA), a vat-photopolymerization technique,
   that uses a laser beam, is known for its ability to fabricate complex 3D
   structures ranging from micron-size needles to life-size organs, because
   of its high resolution, precision, accuracy, and speed. This review
   presents a glimpse of varied 3D printing techniques, mainly expounding
   SLA in terms of the materials used, the orientation of printing, and the
   working mechanisms. The previous works that focused on developing
   pharmaceutical dosage forms, drug-eluting devices, and tissue scaffolds
   are presented in this paper, followed by the challenges associated with
   SLA from an industrial and regulatory perspective. Due to its excellent
   advantages, this technology could transform the conventional ``one dose
   fits all{''} concept to bring digitalized patient-centric medication
   into reality.},

Abstract = {Laser additive manufacturing (LAM) is a near-net-shape production
   technique by which a part can be built up from 3D CAD model data,
   without material removal. Recently, these production processes gained
   attention due to the spreading of polymer-based processes in private and
   commercial applications. However, due to the insufficient development of
   metal producing processes regarding design, process information and
   qualification, resistance on producing functional components with this
   technology is still present. To overcome this restriction further
   studies have to be undertaken. The present research proposes a
   parametric study of additive manufacturing of hot work tool steel, H11.
   The selected LAM process is wire-based laser metal deposition (LMD-W).
   The study consists of parameters optimization for single beads (laser
   power, travel speed and wire feed rate) as well as lateral and vertical
   overlap for layer-by-layer technique involved in LMD process. Results
   show that selection of an ideal set of parameters affects substantially
   the surface quality, bead uniformity and bond between substrate and
   clad. Discussion includes the role of overlapping on the soundness of
   parts based on the height homogeneity of each layer, porosity and the
   presence of gaps. For the conditions tested it was shown that once the
   deposition parameters are selected, lateral and vertical overlapping
   determines the integrity and quality of parts processed by LAM.},

Title = {Experimental and analytical study of the polymer melt flow through the
   hot-end in material extrusion additive manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Material extrusion additive manufacturing utilizes a thermoplastic
   polymer in the form of a solid filament as a built material. The polymer
   melts inside the hot-end channel and flows under the pressure generated
   by the filament feeding force. The flow of polymer through the hot-end
   is not fully understood yet, as it involves many complex phenomena, such
   as phase transition, shear rate and temperature dependent viscosity, as
   well as viscoelastic effects. In this paper, we investigate
   experimentally the filament feeding force, as a function of the feeding
   rate, for different materials (PLA and ABS), liquefier temperatures,
   nozzle diameters, and lengths of the liquefier. Two extrusion regimes
   are identified: a linear regime with a stable flow, and a non-linear
   regime with fluctuations in the feeding force, which are concomitant to
   unstable extrusion. Increasing the liquefier length and liquefier
   temperature are found to extend the linear extrusion regime. It is shown
   that the filament feeding force predicted by the analytical models
   available in the literature deviates from the measurements, especially
   at high feeding rates. A model solely based on heat transfer
   considerations is proposed to estimate the maximum feeding rate before
   the extrusion becomes unstable. The modelling results agree well with
   the measurements. The model can be used to select the hot-end design as
   well as appropriate printing parameters.},

Abstract = {The high hardness, melting temperature and environmental resistance of
   most ceramic materials makes them well-suited for propulsion,
   tribilogical and protective applications. However, these same attributes
   pose difficulties for manufacturing and machining of ceramics and
   ultimately limit the achievable design space of these materials.
   Recently, a new class of preceramic photopolymers has been developed
   that enables additive manufacturing of ceramics using commercially
   available stereolithography systems. By consolidating preceramic
   monomers via layer-wise exposure to ultraviolet light and subsequently
   pyrolyzing under an inert atmosphere to form a ceramic, this method
   allows for complex geometry parts that cannot be produced with
   traditional sintering, pressing or vapor infiltration processes. In
   order to retain geometric fidelity and generate flaw-free
   microstructures, volumetric and gravimetric changes during the
   polymer-to-ceramic conversion must be quantified. To this end, we
   present x-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) measurements of the
   dimensional stability and uniformity of additively manufactured
   silicon-based ceramics as a function of geometry and processing
   conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The latest industrial revolution, Industry 4.0, is driven by the
   emergence of digital manufacturing and, most notably, additive
   manufacturing (AM) technologies. The simultaneous material and structure
   forming in AM broadens the material and structural design space. This
   expanded design space holds a great potential in creating improved
   engineering materials and products that attract growing interests from
   both academia and industry. A major aspect of this growing interest is
   reflected in the increased adaptation of data-driven tools that
   accelerate the exploration of the vast design space in AM. Herein, the
   integration of data-driven tools in various aspects of AM is reviewed,
   from materials design in AM (i.e., homogeneous and composite material
   design) to structure design for AM (i.e., topology optimization). The
   optimization of AM tool path using machine learning for producing
   best-quality AM products with optimal material and structure is also
   discussed. Finally, the perspectives on the future development of
   holistically integrated frameworks of AM and data-driven methods are
   provided.},

   science AM is very much useful in the development of Bone Scaffolds. The
   bone scaffold needs the good level of porosity for the cultivation of
   cells. In this work, an algorithm for a novel structure with the theme
   of flexible porosity was introduced. Scaffold models were developed
   using CATIA V5 for four different porosities. The novel structures made
   of Poly Amide (PA 2200) material were fabricated using a commercially
   available Selective Laser Sintering machine (SLS). The differences in
   scaffold theoretical and experimental porosities were investigated and
   the percentage of error was discussed.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, additive manufacturing otherwise known as three-dimensional
   (3D) printing is fully implemented into the production of hard tissue
   replacements. Department of Biomedical Engineering and Measurement
   together with Biomedical Engineering company designed and produced more
   than 300 implants made of Ti64 ELI titanium alloy using additive
   technologies, which were subsequently implanted by surgeons worldwide.
   3D printing of PEEK, bioceramic and magnesium alloys implants is
   recently tested to offer alternative materials to titanium for
   cranioplasties or biodegradable impalnts. 3D bioprinting is being
   applied to regenerative medicine to address the need for tissues and
   organs suitable for transplantation. Compared with non-biological
   printing, 3D bioprinting involves additional complexities, such as the
   choice of materials, cell types, growth and differentiation factors, and
   technical challenges related to the sensitivities of living cells and
   the construction of tissues. The 3D bioplotter was used to prepare
   tubular structures made of PLA + PHB polymer for substitutes of human
   urethra. Tubular structures were tested from geometrical point of view
   to assure required precision, repeatability and possibility to print
   porous structures for application of epithelial and muscle cells and
   their growth. Several studies on PEEK spinal implants manufactured by 3D
   printing were realized, where mechanical testing, simulations and
   testing of biocompatibility were implemented. Presented research covers
   selected case studies of patient specific implants made by additive
   manufacturing and research in medical 3D bioprinting for tissue
   engineering.},

Abstract = {Ultrasonic additive manufacturing (UAM) is a low temperature
   manufacturing method capable of embedding printed electronics in metal
   components. The effect of UAM processing on the resistivity of
   conductive tracks printed with five different conductive pastes based on
   silver, copper or carbon flakes/particles in either a thermoplastic or
   thermoset filler binder are investigated. For all but the carbon-based
   paste, the resistivity changed linearly with the UAM energy input. After
   UAM processing, a resistivity increase of more than 150 times was
   recorded for the copper based thermoset paste. The silver based pastes
   showed a resistivity increase of between 1.1 and 50 times from their
   initial values. The carbon-based paste showed no change in resistivity
   after UAM processing. Focussed ion beam microstructure analysis of the
   printed conductive tracks before and after UAM processing showed that
   the silver particles and flakes in at least one of the pastes partly
   dislodged from their thermoset filler creating voids, thereby increasing
   the resistivity, whereas the silver flakes in a thermoplastic filler did
   not dislodge due to material flow of the polymer binder. The lowest
   resistivity (8 x 10(-5) Omega cm) after UAM processing was achieved for
   a thermoplastic paste with silver flakes at low UAM processing energy.

Abstract = {Biopolymers are promising environmentally benign materials applicable in
   multifarious applications. They are especially favorable in implantable
   biomedical devices thanks to their excellent unique properties,
   including bioactivity, renewability, bioresorbability, biocompatibility,
   biodegradability and hydrophilicity. Additive manufacturing (AM) is a
   flexible and intricate manufacturing technology, which is widely used to
   fabricate biopolymer-based customized products and structures for
   advanced healthcare systems. Three-dimensional (3D) printing of these
   sustainable materials is applied in functional clinical settings
   including wound dressing, drug delivery systems, medical implants and
   tissue engineering. The present review highlights recent advancements in
   different types of biopolymers, such as proteins and polysaccharides,
   which are employed to develop different biomedical products by using
   extrusion, vat polymerization, laser and inkjet 3D printing techniques
   in addition to normal bioprinting and four-dimensional (4D) bioprinting
   techniques. This review also incorporates the influence of nanoparticles
   on the biological and mechanical performances of 3D-printed tissue
   scaffolds. This work also addresses current challenges as well as future
   developments of environmentally friendly polymeric materials
   manufactured through the AM techniques. Ideally, there is a need for
   more focused research on the adequate blending of these biodegradable
   biopolymers for achieving useful results in targeted biomedical areas.

Title = {Hybrid microfabrication of 3D pyrolytic carbon electrodes by
   photolithography and additive manufacturing},
Journal = {MICRO AND NANO ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We report a novel hybrid method for fabricating high aspect ratio 3D
   pyrolytic carbon electrodes combining UV photolithography and additive
   manufacturing with commercially available SLA 3D printers and materials.
   By using a 3D printed chip holder, aligned 3D printing on a patterned
   silicon chip was possible. This allowed for the fabrication of
   cylindrical polymer micropillars with a height of 2173 +/-\& nbsp;26 mu
   m and a width of 316 +/-\& nbsp;11 mu m on SU-8 precursor structures
   defining the leads, contact pads and underlying 2D electrode prepared
   using UV lithography. Microfabrication of 3D structures with these
   dimensions is impossible to achieve with SU-8 photolithography alone.
   The hybrid polymer structures were converted into 3D carbon electrodes
   with high structural integrity using a 3-step pyrolysis process
   optimized for the specific 3D print resin. During this process, the
   micropillars shrunk to 30 +/-\& nbsp;3\% in height and 35 +/-\& nbsp;1\%
   in width of the polymer precursor structures, while maintaining the
   macroscopic shape and microscopic surface roughness. Electrochemical
   experiments confirmed that the pyrolytic carbon formed a monolithic
   conductive 3D electrode. The surface roughness contributed to a 17 +/-\&
   nbsp;5\% increase in electroactive surface area compared to the
   geometrical surface area of the micropillars.},

Title = {Mechanical response of adhesive and hybrid joints containing novel

Journal = {CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {379},
Month = {MAY 23},
Abstract = {The paper presents a novel concept of purely adhesive and hybrid joints
   fabrication with the application of Additive Manufacturing (AM)
   technology. 5 different models of metal-polymer single lap joints (SLJ)
   were manufactured using VHB (Very High Bonding) 5925 double-sided tape
   and experimentally tested. To reduce the SLJ eccentricity during the
   tensile loading an appropriate chamfering of the polymer part shape was
   proposed by applying the AM technology. The Zortax M300 printer was used
   to produce the polymer adherends and ``dog bone{''} type specimens,
   which allowed the determination of tensile strength, which value was
   6.62 MPa. The effectiveness of the joints was assessed by the maximum
   force values, the absorption energy, and the repeat-ability of the
   results for each model. The highest force of 400.4 N was obtained for
   the single-lap reference model. Finally, hybrid joints were produced by
   the application of double-sided tape and mechanical connectors, like
   tenons placed in the 3D printed polymer part and mortises situated in
   the aluminium adherends. This new joining technique allowed for an
   increase in maximum force to a value of 832.5 N.},

Journal = {POWDER TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {422},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {The flowability and spreadability of three different polymer powders for
   selective laser sintering were investigated by analysing the powder at
   different temperatures. These measurements were performed using both the
   Revolution Powder Analyzer and the Schulze Ring Shear Tester. The latter
   device was modified with a selfdeveloped heating system to allow testing
   at temperatures up to 170 degrees C. Overall, the results of both tests
   showed that the powders' flowability decreases as the temperature
   increases, with the largest decrease observed near the materials'
   melting point. Afterwards, recoating tests were conducted on an EOS P395
   machine, which utilized a self-built AI monitoring system to detect and
   evaluate the severity of defects in the powder bed. The tests revealed
   that the number and severity of defects also increases with temperature.
   When approaching the sintering window, the number and severity of
   defects greatly decreases, and the powder bed becomes stronger and more
   resistant to defects.},

Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {29},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper proposes an additive manufacturing method that combines fused
   filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printing and an electroforming technology
   to fabricate multi-material structures composed of resin and metal. In
   this method, an FFF 3D printer prints a resin mold that functions as a
   structural unit in a multi-material structure and as a sacrificial
   plastic mold for the addition of the metal material. This sacrificial
   mold is eventually removed. Electroforming the interior of a printed
   resin mold enables the fabrication of multi-material structures using
   resin and metal materials. The fabrication conditions for multi-material
   structures when using the proposed method were investigated and the
   surfaces of the resulting structures were evaluated. The fabrication
   conditions for the specified thickness per process and the total
   thicknesses from all the processes were determined. Furthermore, our
   results indicated that the shape of the side of the metal portion
   depended on the forming precision of the FFF 3D printer. We present an
   example of the fabrication of a gear shape from resin and metal.},

Abstract = {A disk-shaped ceramic catalyst made by 3D printing (3DP) is used to
   reform syngas. We select two Al2O3 powders (a-and high-surface-area
   theta-Al2O3) and polymeric binders for preparing the 3DP feedstock.
   Catalyst stacked Al2O3 disks are made by kneading the polymers with
   ceramic powders and extruding to produce filaments, which are melted and
   used for 3D additive manufacturing (AM). The processing parameters
   (sequence of addition, viscosity of the feedstock, etc.), the phase
   transformation of the.-powder, and catalytic properties of the made
   carrier are examined. The made alumina disks were densified to a
   relative density (RD) of 40\% -65\%. Two porous disks were coated with
   catalyst NiO and CeO2, and used to reform syngas made from waste paper.
   The best case reforms the CH4 content in the syngas from 25.7\% down to
   0.15\% or lower. The reformed gaseous fuel is suitable for solid oxide
   fuel cells (SOFCs).},

Abstract = {Metal additive manufacturing (AM) has been receiving unprecedented
   attention for its transformational role in extending the AM materials
   from polymers to various metals. However, various quality issues,
   especially porosity, significantly impacts the mechanical properties and
   fatigue life of the final products, which imposes barriers for the
   widespread adoption of metal AM processes. In this study, we use the
   deep learning (DL) techniques to comprehensively investigate the
   relationships between pore microstructure and processing parameters.
   Specifically, a novel hybrid deep generative prediction network (HDGPN)
   that leverages both variational autoencoder and generative adversarial
   network is proposed to characterize the complex pore microstructure with
   in-depth representations and predict pore morphology under arbitrary
   processing parameters. By visualizing the predicted pore morphology, the
   complicated interaction dynamics between the processing parameters and
   pore microstructure are directly revealed, which may guide the
   optimization of metal AM manufacturing processes to fabricate
   defect-free products. A case study of a selective laser melting (SLM)
   process is conducted to validate the proposed modeling and prediction
   framework.},

Title = {Linking Processing Parameters and Rheology to Optimize Additive
   Manufacturing of k-Carrageenan Gel Systems},
Journal = {GELS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing-in particular, three-dimensional (3D)
   printing-has been introduced since the late 1980s, offering a novel
   paradigm for engineering design and manufacturing, as it allows the
   fabrication of very complex structures. Additive manufacturing of
   hydrogels is a very popular method to produce scaffolds to be used in
   tissue engineering and other biomedical applications, as well as in
   other advanced technological areas. When printing a thermoreversible
   physical hydrogel, a subtle balance between thermal and rheological
   parameters exists. The characteristic times of the sol-gel transition,
   regulated by a well-defined thermal history, must be optimized with
   respect to the characteristic processing times. In this work, we use
   this thermo-rheological approach to the additive manufacturing of a
   physical hydrogel. A low-cost desktop 3D printer for thermoplastic
   polymers was suitably modified to print a 1.5 wt\% solution of
   k-carrageenan. The thermal behavior of the printer was determined by
   performing experimental measurements of the temperature-time evolution
   during the different processing steps, from solution loading, to the
   extrusion of the incoming gel, to the final solidification stage. In
   parallel, linear viscoelastic oscillatory shear measurements were
   performed in a rotational rheometer under thermal histories as close as
   possible to those previously measured in the printing process. The
   comparison between the rheological results and the quality of printing
   under different thermal histories is presented and discussed,
   highlighting the main relations between rheological and processing
   behavior, which are helpful in the assessment and optimization of the

   it is the most common plastic used in FDM due to its good mechanical
   properties, stiffness, and strength. Upon production process
   optimization, filaments with rCF loadings of 5 and 10\% wt are produced
   and analyzed. A particular attention is devoted to the evaluation of the
   production process on the carbon fibers (CFs) length and the study of

Abstract = {With the growing interest in 3D printing, many studies are being
   conducted to replace conventional manufacturing processes. In terms of
   mechanical applications, however, research on the tribological
   characteristics of 3D printing components has not been sufficiently
   conducted. This study investigated the influences of surface texturing
   and roughness on 3D printed specimens. Specimens with and without
   surface texture were printed using a 3D printer, and their frictional
   behavior was compared. The friction coefficient of the textured specimen
   was smaller than that of the untextured specimen. Contact analysis was
   conducted to evaluate the mechanism. The analysis suggested that the
   real contact area of the untextured specimen was similar to that of the
   textured specimen during the initial stage. However, the wear of
   asperities during the friction test increased the real contact area of
   the untextured specimen. Surface roughness was verified to influence the
   untextured specimen more significantly than the textured specimen in
   terms of tribological behavior.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY},

Abstract = {Objectives: To investigate the influence of additive manufacturing
   method and build angle on surface characteristics and Candida albicans
   (C. albicans) adhesion to 3D printed denture base polymers. Methods:
   Specimens of 3D printing denture base polymers were prepared by two
   printers, namely, stereolithography (SLA, Form 3B) and digital light
   processing technology (DLP, Solflex 350 plus). Three build angles were
   used: 0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees. Surface topography was
   examined by scanning electron microscopy. Also, arithmetical mean height
   (Sa) values were calculated. An adhesion test was performed to observe
   initial C. albicans adhesion to the specimens. The data were
   statistically analyzed using the two-way analysis of variance and
   Tukey's multiple comparison test. Results: The data of Sa values had
   statistically significant differences, which were mainly determined by
   the main factor of build angle (p < 0.05). Moreover, the quantitative
   results of C. albicans adhesion exhibited no significant differences:
   printing techniques (p = 0.7794) and build angle (p = 0.0589),
   respectively. Conclusions: Surface roughness was significantly
   influenced by the build angle rather than by the AM method. Whereas, AM
   method (SLA and DLP) and build angle (0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90o)
   had no impacts on the C. albicans adhesion to the 3D printed denture
   bases. Clinical Significance: Build angle dominates the surface
   roughness and topography of the 3D printed denture polymers. Our results
   indicate that C. albicans' adhesion might not be influenced by AM method
   and build angle.},

Title = {Design for additive manufacturing from a force-flow perspective},
Journal = {MATERIALS \& DESIGN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {204},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {With the increasing application of additive manufacturing (AM) in the
   industry, more attention has been paid to the performance of the
   additively manufactured part. How to maximize the structural efficiency
   of a part to achieve the desired performance has become the focus and
   challenge of design for additive manufacturing (DFAM). To give full play
   to the complex-geometry, multi-material, multi-scale, and multi-function
   manufacturing capabilities of AM, new approaches in DFAM have to be
   explored. The relationship between stress and growth in biology
   indicates that naturally evolved perfect structures are all optimal
   responses to their applied force. This work discusses a novel method to
   DFAM at the macroscale, mesoscale and microscale from a force-flow
   perspective, aiming to achieve an organic integration of force-flow
   based design with AM-driven manufacturing. Firstly, the characteristics
   of force-flow and its embodiment in nature and engineering are analyzed.
   Then, an overview of topology optimization, lattice/cellular structure
   design and infill pattern design are respectively provided in the
   combination of force-flow and AM. Finally, the future development
   directions of DFAM based on force flow are proposed according to the
   limitations of current research.

Title = {Additively manufactured carbon fiber-reinforced composites: State of the
   art and perspective},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {While polymer additive manufacturing (AM) has advanced significantly
   over the past few decades, the limitations in material properties, speed
   of manufacture, and part size have relegated this technology to the
   space of rapid prototyping rather than the legitimate manufacture of
   end-use parts. Carbon fiber offers a low density, a low coefficient of
   thermal expansion, and high thermal conductivity and is an ideal
   material for bringing polymer-based AM from the realm of form and fit to
   that of form, fit, and function. Use of carbon fiber in AM can improve
   material properties, reduce the time required to manufacture functional
   parts compared with traditional subtractive technologies, and reduce
   warping, thereby enabling a larger possible build envelope. Therefore,
   the addition of carbon fiber to various AM technologies is of increasing
   interest in academic and industrial communities. This paper examines the
   work performed in this fast-growing area to date. Specifically, the
   effects of fiber reinforcement on the structure and mechanical
   properties of 3D printed parts are investigated within the body of
   literature. Upper bounds for tensile properties of carbon fiber
   composites are theoretically evaluated and compared with experimentally
   measured values. Moreover, current and potential applications of
   additively manufactured carbon fiber composites in the context of
   desktop 3D printing and big area AM are discussed. Recent innovations
   and industry breakthroughs in this field are also examined. This review
   is intended to organize and synthesize the present body of work
   surrounding AM of carbon fiber reinforced plastics, identify the most
   promising technologies, and prescribe viable research and development
   paths forward to advance AM from the application space of rapid
   prototyping to that of functional, load-bearing, end-use parts.},

Title = {Wave Attenuation in Additively Manufactured Polymer Acoustic Black Hole
   Structures Considering the Viscoelastic Effect},
Journal = {POLYMERS},

Abstract = {The acoustic black hole (ABH) is a feature commonly found in thin-walled
   structures that is characterized by a diminishing thickness and damping
   layer with an efficient wave energy dissipation effect, which has been
   extensively studied. The additive manufacture of polymer ABH structures
   has shown promise as a low-cost method to manufacture ABHs with complex
   geometries, exhibiting even more effective dissipation. However, the
   commonly used elastic model with viscous damping for both the damping
   layer and polymer ignores the viscoelastic changes that occur due to
   variations in frequency. To address this, we used Prony exponential
   series expansion to describe the viscoelastic behavior of the material,
   where the modulus is represented by a summation of decaying exponential
   functions. The parameters of the Prony model were obtained through
   experimental dynamic mechanical analysis and applied to finite element
   models to simulate wave attenuation characteristics in polymer ABH
   structures. The numerical results were validated by experiments, where
   the out-of-plane displacement response under a tone burst excitation was
   measured by a scanning laser doppler vibrometer system. The experimental
   results illustrated good consistency with the simulations, demonstrating
   the effectiveness of the Prony series model in predicting wave
   attenuation in polymer ABH structures. Finally, the effect of loading
   frequency on wave attenuation was studied. The findings of this study
   have implications for the design of ABH structures with improved wave
   attenuation characteristics.},

Abstract = {For the tens past years, important development has been achieved on the
   adaptation of additive manufacturing to the construction industry using
   concrete. They mostly concerns control rheology at fresh state, setting
   time, and technology advances. Nevertheless, the reinforcement of 3D
   printed part remains an open question. Different reinforcement protocols
   have been proposed in the literature, often based on traditional way of
   reinforcement. In this context, the aim of this paper is to present an
   alternative way to reinforce extruded concrete or other pasty materials
   inspired by the composite industry. The present patented manufacturing
   methodology is based on extrusion-based additive manufacturing, inspired
   by pultrusion and co-extrusion process of polymer composites, but taking
   full advantage of the specific rheological behaviour of cementitious
   matrix. It consists in the continuous addition of numerous continuous
   yarn in the extruded mortar before the final extrusion. A comparison
   between those processes is made. Depending on the number of yarns and
   their sizes, this process is showed to provide ductility for limited
   amount of reinforcement and have the potential to be an alternative to
   passive rebar traditionally used in concrete by providing a true
   reinforcement in traction to the structure for larger number of yarns,
   changing extruded concrete in unidirectional composite with brittle
   matrix. Using appropriate matrix formulation, the mastering of its yield
   stress during the extrusion is showed to be the most important process
   parameters. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {This work presents a novel methodology for the quality assessment of
   material extrusion parts through AI-based Computer Vision. To this end,
   different techniques are integrated using inspection methods that are
   applied to other areas in additive manufacturing field. The system is
   divided into four main points: (1) pre-processing, (2) color analysis,
   (3) shape analysis, and (4) defect location. The color analysis is
   performed in CIELAB color space, and the color distance between the part
   under analysis and the reference surface is calculated using the color
   difference formula CIE2000. The shape analysis consists of the
   binarization of the image using the Canny edge detector. Then, the Hu
   moments are calculated for images from the part under analysis and the
   results are compared with those from the reference part. To locate
   defects, the image of the part to be analyzed is first processed with a
   median filter, and both the original and filtered image are subtracted.
   Then, the resulting image is binarized, and the defects are located
   through a blob detector. In the training phase, a subset of parts was
   used to evaluate the performance of different methods and to set the
   values of parameters. Later, in a testing and validation phase, the
   performance of the system was evaluated using a different set of parts.
   The results show that the proposed system is able to classify parts
   produced by additive manufacturing, with an overall accuracy of 86.5\%,
   and to locate defects on their surfaces in a more effective manner.},

Abstract = {Anisotropic materials are important functional materials in many fields.
   The use of these materials is currently being expanded through the rapid
   development of additive manufacturing. However, there is still no
   universal method for fabricating two-dimensional anisotropic polymer
   composites. Here, polylactic acid-carbon fiber composites were prepared
   using the droplet spray method, and their mechanical and friction
   properties were studied. The tensile strength in the X-Y plane
   perpendicular to the direction of the droplet spray was significantly
   higher than that in the direction of droplet ejection. Similar trends
   were observed for the elongation at breaking and the impact strength.
   The friction coefficient was smallest in the X-Y plane. Scanning
   electron microscopy showed that carbon fibers were oriented in the X-Y
   plane, which enhanced the mechanical and friction properties in this
   plane.},

   collector and active layers, and a gel polymer electrolyte, all simply
   printed. Two types of supercapacitors, electrochemical double-layer
   capacitor (EDLC) and pseudocapacitor (PC), were developed with activated
   carbon and graphene-Mn3O4 nanocomposite-based active layers,
   respectively. The all-printed supercapacitors show specific power and
   specific energy of 800.3 W/kg and 1.17 Wh/kg (at 0.5 A/g) for the EDLC
   and 1601 W/kg and 10.6 Wh/kg (at 1 A/g) for the PC. Extended durability
   tests reveal that the EDLC exhibits negligible performance deviation

Abstract = {An additive manufacturing-enabled bi-continuous piezocomposite
   architecture is presented to achieve mechanical flexibility and
   piezoelectricity simultaneously in piezoelectric materials. This
   architecture comprises an active ferroelectric ceramic phase and a
   passive flexible polymer phase, which are separated by a tailorable
   phase interface. Triply periodic minimal surfaces were used to define
   the phase interface, due to their excellent elastic properties and load
   transfer efficiency. A suspension-enclosing projection-stereolithography
   process was used to additively manufacture this material. Postprocesses
   including polymer infiltration, electroding, and poling are introduced.
   Piezoelectric properties of the piezocomposites are numerically and
   experimentally studied. The results highlight the role of tailorable
   triply periodic phase interfaces in promoting mechanical flexibility and
   piezoelectricity of bi-continuous piezocomposites.},

Title = {Development of modified release 3D printed tablets (printlets) with

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to manufacture 3D printed tablets (printlets)
   from enteric polymers by single filament fused deposition modeling (FDM)
   3D printing (3DP). Hot melt extrusion was used to generate
   paracetamol-loaded filaments from three different grades of the
   pharmaceutical excipient hypromellose acetate succinate (HPMCAS), grades
   LG, MG and HG. One-step 3DP was used to process these filaments into
   enteric printlets incorporating up to 50\% drug loading with two
   different infill percentages (20 and 100\%). X-ray Micro Computed
   Tomography (Micro-CT) analysis revealed that printlets with 20\% infill
   had cavities in the core compared to 100\% infill, and that the density
   of the 50\% drug loading printlets was higher than the equivalent
   formulations loaded with 5\% drug. In biorelevant bicarbonate
   dissolution media, drug release from the printlets was dependent on the
   polymer composition, drug loading and the internal structure of the
   formulations. All HPMCAS-based printlets showed delayed drug release
   properties, and in the intestinal conditions, drug release was faster
   from the printlets prepared with polymers with a lower pH-threshold:
   HPMCAS LG > HPMCAS MG > HPMCAS HG. These results confirm that FDM 3D
   printing makes it possible not only to manufacture delayed release
   printlets without the need for an outer enteric coating, but it is also
   feasible to adapt the release profile in response to the personal
   characteristics of the patient, realizing the full potential of additive
   manufacturing in the development of personalised dose medicines. (C)

Abstract = {Cementitious material is mechanically brittle and weak in tensile by
   nature. Moreover, 3D printed cementitious material is orthotropic and
   have a weakness line between layers. Conventional reinforcement
   technique for concrete utilizes rigid rebars to impart mechanical
   performance of concrete structures and improve its loading carrying
   capacity. However, rigid rebars limit the free-form capabilities of
   additive manufacturing and goes against its freedom of design principle.
   To overcome this issue, glass fiber reinforced polymer and carbon fiber
   reinforced polymer sheets were used to reinforced 3D printed
   cementitious material in this study. The reinforced printed concrete
   specimens were tested on four-point bending test, and the influence of
   FRP on 3D printable mortar and fiber reinforced mortar were analyzed
   based on load capacity, ductility, fracture energy and failure mode.},

Abstract = {Within this contribution liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and
   precipitation from ethanol was studied as an approach to produce
   polyamide 11 (PA11) powders for selective laser sintering (SLS). To this
   end, the cloud point and solution temperature curve of the PAll-ethanol
   system was determined experimentally via turbidity measurements. The
   proper range of system composition and temperature for particle
   formation was deduced. The dependence of particle characteristics on
   process parameters (polymer concentration, stirring conditions and
   temperature regime) during LLPS and precipitation was assessed and the
   products were characterized with respect to their size and morphology.
   Furthermore, structural, rheological and thermal characteristics were
   analyzed and correlated with process parameters. Molecular weight
   distributions were determined. After removal of fines and dry coating
   with hydrophobic fumed silica, an optimized PA11 powder with mean
   particle size of 91 mu m showing good flowability for SLS was obtained.
   SLS processability of this optimized PA11 powder was demonstrated by
   building multilayered test specimens in a laser sintering machine. With
   this contribution, we present a comprehensive workflow for the process
   development, product characterization and product application of a SLS
   powder manufactured via precipitation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Despite its recent popularity, additive manufacturing (AM) still faces
   many technical challenges for the insufficiency of process reliability,
   controllability, and product quality. To enhance the process
   repeatability, effective in-situ monitoring methods for AM processes are
   needed. In this study, an online monitoring method for AM process
   failure detection is proposed, where acoustic emission (AE) is applied
   as the sensing technique. Its application to polymer material extrusion,
   also known as the technology of fused deposition modeling (FDM), is
   demonstrated. Experimental results show that the proposed monitoring
   method allows for the real time identification of major process
   failures. The occurring time of major failures and failure modes can be
   identified by analyzing the time- and frequency-domain features of AE
   hits respectively. A K-means clustering algorithm is applied to verify
   and demonstrate the classification procedure. The automated failure
   identification can reduce the waste of fabrication with enhanced machine
   intelligence.},

   sectors with high benefit such as the Medtech. The AM of continuous
   fiber reinforced composite is a technology that, although still in its

   be particularly interesting for the production of prosthetic devices for
   sports (ESAR devices such as foot or foil). In this work, is explored
   the potential of additive manufacturing in the field of prosthetics of
   the lower limb through an multidisciplinary approach, involving several
   competences from the clinical evaluation, integration of biomechanics,
   development of new composite and hybrid materials based on polymers,
   carbon fibres and metal inserts, and implementation of optical sensors
   with their integration in the composites for the continuous monitoring
   of prosthetic devices and their durability.},

Abstract = {Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) has been the focus of substantial additive
   manufacturing research for two principal reasons: (a) the mechanical
   performance approaches that of aluminum at relatively high temperatures
   for thermoplastics and (b) the potential for qualification in both the
   aerospace and biomedical industries. Although PEEK provides outstanding
   strength and thermal stability, printing can be difficult due to the
   high melting point. Recently, high-temperature soluble support has
   enabled the printing of lattices and stochastic foams with overhanging
   features in these high-performance carbon fiber thermoplastics, in which
   density can be optimized to strike a balance between weight and strength
   to enhance performance in applications such as custom implants or
   aerospace structures. Although polymer powder bed fusion has long been
   capable of the combination of these geometries and materials, material
   extrusion with high-temperature sacrificial support is dramatically less
   expensive. This research provides a comprehensive mechanical analysis
   and CT-scan-based dimensional study of carbon fiber PEEK lattice
   structures enabled with high-temperature support and including model
   validation.},

Abstract = {Fabricating a robotic component comprising 100s of distributed,
   connected sensors can be very difficult with current approaches. To
   address these challenges, we are developing a novel additive
   manufacturing technology to enable the integrated fabrication of robotic
   structural elements with distributed, interconnected sensors and
   actuators. The focus is on resistive and capacitive sensors and
   electromagnetic actuators, though others are anticipated. Anticipated
   applications beyond robotics include advanced prosthetics, wearable
   electronics, and defense electronics. This paper presents preliminary
   results for printing polymers and conductive material simultaneously to
   form small sensor arrays. Approaches to optimizing sensor performance
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {In an effort to simplify power electronics integration, we explored an
   additive manufacturing (AM) process, or commonly known as
   three-dimensional (3D) printing for fabricating magnetic components. A
   commercial fused-deposition-model (FDM) 3D printer was modified to
   extrude pastes of powder materials into 3D structures. We formulated a
   low-temperature curable Poly-Mag paste, which is a mixture of magnetic
   powder and a polymer, as a feed material for printing the magnetic core
   and used a commercial nanosilver paste for printing the winding. After
   the structure was printed, it was cured at 250 degrees C for an hour
   without any external pressure to form the magnetic component. The
   electrical resistivity of the printed winding was about three times
   higher than that of bulk silver. This is because of the low curing
   temperature resulted in a lower density than the bulk. The relative
   permeability dispersion of the printed core had a bandwidth up to 10 MHz
   with a static relative permeability of about 10. Both the winding and
   core magnetic properties will be improved by adjusting the feed paste
   formulations and their flow characteristics and fine-tuning the printer
   parameters, such as motor speeds, extrusion rate, and nozzle sizes.},

Abstract = {Thermoplastic polymer-filler composites are excellent materials for bone
   tissue engineering (TE) scaffolds, combining the functionality of
   fillers with suitable load-bearing ability, biodegradability, and
   additive manufacturing (AM) compatibility of the polymer. Two key
   determinants of their utility are their rheological behavior in the
   molten state, determining AM processability and their mechanical
   load-bearing properties. We report here the characterization of both
   these physical properties for four bone TE relevant composite
   formulations with poly(ethylene oxide terephthalate)/poly(butylene
   terephthalate (PEOT/PBT) as a base polymer, which is often used to
   fabricate TE scaffolds. The fillers used were reduced graphene oxide
   (rGO), hydroxyapatite (HA), gentamicin intercalated in zirconium
   phosphate (ZrP-GTM) and ciprofloxacin intercalated in MgAl layered
   double hydroxide (MgAl-CFX). The rheological assessment showed that
   generally the viscous behavior dominated the elastic behavior (G{''} >
   G') for the studied composites, at empirically determined extrusion
   temperatures. Coupled rheological-thermal characterization of ZrP-GTM
   and HA composites showed that the fillers increased the solidification
   temperatures of the polymer melts during cooling. Both these findings
   have implications for the required extrusion temperatures and bonding
   between layers. Mechanical tests showed that the fillers generally not
   only made the polymer stiffer but more brittle in proportion to the
   filler fractions. Furthermore, the elastic moduli of scaffolds did not
   directly correlate with the corresponding bulk material properties,
   implying composite-specific AM processing effects on the mechanical
   properties. Finally, we show computational models to predict
   multimaterial scaffold elastic moduli using measured single material
   scaffold and bulk moduli. The reported characterizations are essential
   for assessing the AM processability and ultimately the suitability of
   the manufactured scaffolds for the envisioned bone regeneration
   application.},

Title = {Continuous basalt fibers into fireproof and thermal insulation
   architectures using an additive manufacturing manipulator},
Journal = {MATERIALS \& DESIGN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {235},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Continuous basalt fiber is an emerging high-performance foundational
   material that can be widely used in fields such as road construction,
   energy conservation and environmental protection, aerospace, military
   equipment, and marine ships. However, it is difficult for existing
   processing techniques to form continuous basalt architectures with
   three-dimensional (3D) complex shapes. In addition, the basalt fibers in
   the architectures are filled with polymers, which cannot fully utilize
   the performance of basalt fibers. Therefore, here, we report the
   fabrication of continuous basalt fibers with fireproof and thermal
   insulation performance through the combination of an Additive
   manufacturing (AM) manipulator, two-step precursor infiltration and
   pyrolysis (PIP) processes. Using SiOC ceramics to fill between
   continuous basalt fibers will help improve the architectures' fire and
   thermal insulation performance. The continuous basalt fibers coated with
   thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) were processed into 3D architectures
   under the action of the laser. Through the vacuum infiltration of the
   SiOC precursor and debinding process, TPU in the 3D architectures was
   removed. In order to reduce the structural defects generated by the
   first PIP process, the final part with fireproof and thermal insulation
   performance was fabricated through the second PIP process. We further
   demonstrated the final part with excellent fireproof and thermal
   insulation performance. The final part had a shell temperature of 788.8
   degrees C and an internal temperature of about 50 degrees C under the
   flame spray gun for the 20 s. By replacing polymers with inorganic
   materials, our basalt architectures exhibit their potential applications
   in military, aviation, and civil fireproof and thermal insulation
   equipment.},

Title = {Additive Manufacturing of an Extended-Release Tablet of Tacrolimus},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {An extended-release tablet of tacrolimus as once-daily dosing was
   fabricated using 3D printing technology. It was developed by combining
   two 3D-printing methods in parallel. Indeed, an optimized mixture of
   PVA, sorbitol, and magnesium stearate as a shell compartment was printed
   through a hot-melt extrusion (HME) nozzle while an HPMC gel mixture of
   the drug in the core compartment was printed by a pressure-assisted
   micro-syringe (PAM). A 3D-printed tablet with an infill of 90\% was
   selected as an optimized formula upon the desired dissolution profile,
   releasing 86\% of the drug at 12 h, similar to the commercial one. The
   weight variation, friability, hardness, assay, and content uniformity
   determination met USP requirements. A microbial evaluation showed that
   the 3D-printed tablet does not support microbial growth. SEM analysis
   showed smooth surfaces with multiple deposited layers. No peak
   interference appeared based on FTIR analysis. No decomposition of the
   polymer and drug was observed in the printing temperature, and no change
   in tacrolimus crystallinity was detected based on TGA and DSC analyses,
   respectively. The novel, sTable 3D-printed tablet, fabricated using
   controllable additive manufacturing, can quickly provide tailored dosing
   with specific kinetic release for personalized medicine at the
   point-of-care.},

Abstract = {Tremendous growth has been witnessed in the field of additive
   manufacturing (AM) technology over the last few decades. It offers a
   plethora of applications and is already being utilized in almost every
   sphere of life. Owing to inherent differences between each AM technique,
   newer fields of research consistently emerge and demand attention. Also,
   the innovative applications of AM open up newer challenges and thus
   avenues for focused attention. One such avenue is AM materials. Raw
   material plays an important role in determining the properties of
   fabricated part. The type and form of raw material largely depend on the
   type of AM fabricators. There is a restriction on material compatibility
   with most of the established AM techniques. This review aims to provide
   an overview of various aspects of AM materials highlighting the progress
   made especially over the past two decades.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Abstract = {Featured Application Additive manufacturing of lightweight structures in
   copper. Material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEX) is a versatile
   technology for producing complex specimens of polymers, ceramics and
   metals. Highly-filled filaments composed of a binder system and a
   high-volume content of sinterable powders are needed to produce ceramic
   or metal parts. After shaping the parts via MEX, the binder is removed
   and the specimens are sintered to obtain a dense part of the sintered
   filler particles. In this article, the applicability of this additive
   manufacturing process to produce copper specimens is demonstrated. The
   particular emphasis is on investigating the production of lightweight
   specimens that retain mechanical properties without increasing their
   weight. The effect of infill grades and the cover presence on the
   debinding process and the flexural properties of the sintered parts was
   studied. It was observed that covers could provide the same flexural
   strength with a maximum weight reduction of approximately 23\%. However,
   a cover on specimens with less than 100\% infill significantly slows
   down the debinding process. The results demonstrate the applicability of
   MEX to produce lightweight copper specimens.},

Title = {Additive manufacturing of re-entrant structures: Well-tailored
   structures, unique properties, modelling approaches and real
   applications},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {78},
Month = {SEP 25},
Abstract = {Re-entrant (RE) structures arise from unique construction enabling them
   to yield a negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) under tension or compression
   loading, which is required in various applications such as pressure
   garments for hypertrophic scar treatment, impact absorbers for
   automobiles, wing fillers for aircrafts and strain sensors. Conventional
   manufacturing techniques, namely extrusion and injection moulding,
   cannot be applied to fabricate RE structures since they contain lattice
   structures typically with complex geometries. This issue has been
   tackled by additive manufacturing (AM), which enables the creation of RE
   structures from various materials including polymers and metals. This
   paper provides a comprehensive review on structural design,
   manufacturing techniques and unique properties that are crucial for
   sophisticated development of novel metamaterials. Modelling approaches
   including an optimisation method to obtain the best structure and
   desired properties are also discussed. Finally, real applications of RE

Abstract = {This study examines the changes in physical and mechanical properties of
   acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) when manufactured using fused
   filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printing across multiple recycling phases.
   Tests were carried out initially using virgin ABS, which subsequently
   underwent two successive closed-loop filament extrusion and 3D printing
   phases. For each endpoint manufacturing phase, samples were examined to
   monitor the changes in thermal characteristics, mechanical properties,
   and polymer degradation. It was found that there was a series of
   physical changes of the polymer, which resulted in reduced melt flow,
   increased glass transition temperature, and the generation of carbonyl
   groups, which may be attributed to the thermal oxidative breakdown of
   both styrene acrylonitrile (SAN) and butadiene components of ABS. The
   recycled polymer also showed a reduction in both tensile and compressive
   strengths compared to the virgin material. However, compared to one-time
   recycled ABS, two-times recycled ABS showed increased strength, implying
   that increased recycle state of the polymer may be advantageous with
   respect to mechanical properties and potential manufacturing
   applications. This study ultimately demonstrates the potential to
   leverage additive manufacturing (AM) toward a closed-loop manufacturing
   paradigm by using waste ABS across several life cycles.},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Sustainability in additive manufacturing refers mainly to the recycling
   rate of polymers and composites used in fused filament fabrication
   (FFF), which nowadays are rapidly increasing in volume and value.
   Recycling of such materials is mostly a thermomechanical process that
   modifies their overall mechanical behavior. The present research work
   focuses on the acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) polymer, which is
   the second most popular material used in FFF-3D printing. In order to
   investigate the effect of the recycling courses on the mechanical
   response of the ABS polymer, an experimental simulation of the recycling
   process that isolates the thermomechanical treatment from other
   parameters (i.e., contamination, ageing, etc.) has been performed. To
   quantify the effect of repeated recycling processes on the mechanic
   response of the ABS polymer, a wide variety of mechanical tests were
   conducted on FFF-printed specimens. Regarding this, standard tensile,
   compression, flexion, impact and micro-hardness tests were performed per
   recycle repetition. The findings prove that the mechanical response of
   the recycled ABS polymer is generally improved over the recycling
   repetitions for a certain number of repetitions. An optimum overall
   mechanical behavior is found between the third and the fifth repetition,
   indicating a significant positive impact of the ABS polymer recycling,
   besides the environmental one.},

Abstract = {Rapid prototyping for material deposition or additive manufacturing has
   been widely used for short time production of parts with complex
   geometry in small series. The three-dimensional printing process needs
   post-processing to improve the strength, stiffness and/or surface finish
   of the parts. Printed parts in pristine condition are generally very
   brittle with a porous structure, so infiltrates have been introduced to
   improve their mechanical and physical characteristics. This work
   investigates the effect of two infiltrates, epoxy polymer and
   cyanoacrylate, under a vacuum pressure system on the mechanical
   properties of powder-based composites made by three-dimensional
   printing. Samples printed under pristine and infiltrated conditions were
   tested under tensile, flexural, compressive and impact loadings. The
   infiltrated samples achieved superior mechanical properties, especially
   when the epoxy polymer was applied via a vacuum system. The
   microstructural analysis showed that the infiltrates were not able to
   penetrate the entire sample, revealing a porous structure in the centre,
   mainly when the cyanoacrylate was used. The epoxy polymer infiltrate was
   able to substantially increase the mechanical performance of
   three-dimensional samples, being a promising material when higher
   structural requirements are required.},

Abstract = {Design flexibility, product customization, waste reduction, and the
   capability to construct complex components, and efficient prototyping,
   are all advantages of 3D printing or additive manufacturing (AM).
   Because the area is continually expanding, it is necessary to conduct
   periodic assessments of one's perceptive of AM processes and their
   progression. Additive manufacturing has enormous promise for a wider
   application, particularly in medical, aerospace, and automotive
   industries. To meet this demand, this article provides a thorough
   assessment of the evolution of materials in Additive Manufacturing (AM)
   and the issues connected with them. The innovatory uses of AM in
   aircraft, biomedical, defensive constructions and buildings were
   particularly emphasised. It starts with an introduction to several AM
   methods, then highlights the trajectory of their advancement. Material
   demands, significant developments in recently discovered materials, and
   prospective applications are all examined in depth and summarised.
   Finally, this review concluded by outlining the primary problems
   currently experienced in the use of AM materials and offering insights
   into the important potential and disadvantages it offers, like standard

Abstract = {SiCN(Fe) ceramics with excellent electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption
   performance were successfully prepared from a preceramic polymer doped
   with ferrocene. Additive manufacturing (Digital Light Processing),
   providing enhanced structural design ability, was employed to fabricate
   samples with complex architectures. During pyrolysis, ferrocene
   catalyzed the in-situ formation of a large amount of turbostratic
   carbon, graphite and SiC nanosized phases, which formed carrier channels
   in the electromagnetic field and increased the conductivity loss.
   Meanwhile, it also increased the dipole polarization, interface
   polarization and the dielectric properties of the material, which
   finally enhanced the EMW absorption capacity of SiCN(Fe) ceramics. When
   containing 0.5 wt \% ferrocene, the material showed good performance
   with EAB 4.57 GHz at 1.30 mm, and RLmin-61.34 dB at 2.22 mm. The RLmin
   of 3D-SiCN-0.5 ceramics was-6 dB, and the RL of the X-band was lower

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing offers flexibility in designing, customizing,
   minimization of waste, manufacturing complex profiles and faster
   prototyping. Among these, polyjet and fused deposition modelling (FDM)
   process are widely employed to manufacture the parts for different
   applications. Hence, a comprehensive review on the mechanical properties
   of polyjet printed and FDM printed parts has been carried out in this
   paper. Under polyjet printing, influence of process parameters such as
   built orientation, built mode, finish type, part spacing and layer
   thickness on the mechanical properties has been discussed. Under FDM
   process, mechanical properties of important and potential polymeric
   materials such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polylactic acid,
   polyether-ether-ketone and polyetherimide have been reviewed.
   Altogether, this paper gives an overview of mechanical properties of 3D
   printed parts, including a survey on selection of process parameters in
   polyjet process and materials selection in FDM process.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing has shown potential for manufacturing parts out
   of metals, plastics and even ceramics. This paper reports on Selective
   Laser Melting (SLM) for depositing glass which has significantly
   different material properties from metals, ceramics or polymers. A CO2
   laser is used to locally melt portions of a powder bed to explore the
   effects of process parameters on stationary particle formation as well
   as continuous line quality. Numerical modeling is also applied to gain
   insight into the physical process. The experimental and numerical
   results indicate that the absorptivity of the glass powder is nearly
   constant with respect to the processing parameters. Finally we show that
   higher quality parts can be created using a wire-fed instead of powder
   bed process. Industrially, the additive manufacturing of glass is
   potentially relevant for gradient index optics, systems with embedded
   optics and applications where glass is used to form a hermetic seal.},

Abstract = {A recent revolution in additive manufacturing technologies and access to
   3D Computer Assisted Design (CAD) software has spurred an explosive
   growth of new technologies in biomedical engineering. This includes
   biomodels for diagnosis, surgical training, hard and soft tissue
   replacement, biodevices and tissue engineering. Moreover, recent
   developments in high-definition additive manufacturing systems such as
   Multi-Jet Modelling (MJM) and Stereolithography (SLA), capable of
   reproducing feature sizes close to 100 mu m, promise brand new
   capabilities in fabrication of optical-grade biomicrofluidic
   Lab-on-a-Chip and MEMS devices.
   Compared with other rapid prototyping technologies such as soft
   lithography and infrared laser micromachining in PMMA, SLA and MJM
   systems can enable user-friendly production of prototypes, superior
   feature reproduction quality and comparable levels of optical
   transparency. Prospectively they can revolutionize fabrication of
   microfluidic devices with complex geometric features and eliminate the
   need to use clean room environment and conventional microfabrication
   techniques.
   In this work we demonstrate preliminary data on toxicity profiling of a
   panel of common polymers used in 3D printing applications. The main
   motivation of our work was to evaluate toxicity profiles of most
   commonly used polymers using standardized biotests according to OECD
   guidelines for testing of chemic risk assessment. Our work for the first
   time provides a multispecies view of potential dangers and limitation
   for building biocompatible devices using FDM, SLA and MJM additive
   manufacturing systems. Our work shows that additive manufacturing holds
   significant promise for fabricating LOC and MEMS but requires caution
   when selecting systems and polymers due to toxicity exhibited by some 3D
   printing polymers.},

Title = {Investigation and characterization of the additive manufacturing of
   polycaprolactone/bioactive glass hybrid scaffolds for bone tissue
   engineering via material extrusion processing},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 19},
Abstract = {Thanks to its versatility and effectiveness, additive manufacturing is
   expected to completely revolutionize the biomedical science field. In
   bone regenerative medicine, in particular, additive manufacturing has
   the great potential of opening new avenues of development for
   patient-specific ad hoc therapies. In theory, a defect could be scanned
   and precisely replicated, thus offering the best fitting for each
   patient. The main bottleneck to date is the relatively scarce
   availability of materials that can be printed reliably and consistently.
   This is the case for organic/inorganic hybrids, materials produced by
   sol-gel chemistry that combine the advantages of polymers and
   bioinorganics at the molecular scale. Due to their complex structure and
   unique rheological and mechanical properties, the printing of hybrids
   remains challenging. With this study, we aim to investigate the
   rheological, thermal and molecular properties of a class I
   polycaprolactone/bioactive glass hybrid and discover how they correlate
   with the printability of the material. The molecular weight distribution
   (gel permeation chromatography), thermal properties (thermal gravimetric
   analysis, differential scanning calorimetry) and rheological properties
   of each hybrid material were investigated at all stages of processing.
   Printing trials via direct material extrusion processing followed by
   morphological characterization were performed on both polymers and
   hybrids. Their apatite-forming ability in simulated body fluid was
   evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and particle-induced X-ray
   emission. Results confirmed the successful manufacturing of
   organic/inorganic hybrids using direct material extrusion processing for
   the first time. Three-dimensional scaffolds were successfully produced
   without the need for further processing. No additional solvents or
   convoluted indirect approaches were necessary. Thanks to the thermal
   analysis, an ideal temperature window for printing was identified. SBF
   immersion assays confirmed that the material's bioactivity is retained
   after printing. Considering the presented findings, material extrusion
   processing might develop into an essential technique for fabricating
   superior 3D bioactive scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.},

Abstract = {Flexible ternary carbon black/Bi2Te3 based alloy/polylactic acid
   (CB/BTBA/PLA) composites were fabricated by additive manufacturing and
   their thermoelectric properties were investigated from 300 K to 360 K.
   At 300 K, as the mass ratios of BTBAs in the composites increased from
   38.5\% to 71.4\%, both the electrical conductivity and Seebeck
   coefficient of the composites increased from 5.8 S/cm to 13.3 S/cm, and
   from 60.2 mV/K to 119.9 mV/K, respectively, and the thermal conductivity
   slightly increased from 0.15 W m(-1)K(-1) to 0.25 W m(-1)K(-1), as a
   result, the ZT value of the composites increased from 0.004 to 0.023. As
   the temperature increased from 300 K to 360 K, the electrical
   conductivity of all the composites slightly decreased, while the thermal
   conductivity slowly increased, and a highest ZT value of 0.024 was
   achieved for the composites with 71.4\% BTBAs at 320 K. Unlike
   traditional sterolithography, fused deposition modeling, selective laser
   melting, etc., this additive manufacturing process can directly print
   the solutions which contain inorganic fillers and polymer matrixes into
   almost any designed intricate geometries of thermoelectric composites,
   therefore this process has great potential to be used for fabrication of
   flexible polymer based thermoelectric composites and devices. (C) 2020

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) technology is not only used to make 3D
   objects but also for rapid prototyping. In industry and laboratories,
   quality controls for these objects are necessary though difficult to
   implement compared to classical methods of fabrication because the
   layer-by-layer printing allows for very complex object manufacturing
   that is unachievable with standard tools. Furthermore, AM can induce
   unknown or unexpected defects. Consequently, we demonstrate terahertz
   (THz) imaging as an innovative method for 2D inspection of polymer
   materials. Moreover, THz tomography may be considered as an alternative
   to x-ray tomography and cheaper 3D imaging for routine control. This
   paper proposes an experimental study of 3D polymer objects obtained by
   additive manufacturing techniques. This approach allows us to
   characterize defects and to control dimensions by volumetric
   measurements on 3D data reconstructed by tomography. (C) 2016 Optical

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a growing method due to the ability to
   produce with little to no waste, construction of previously impossible
   designs, and less tooling needed for fabrication. While every
   manufacturing method has advantages and drawbacks, this paper covers AM
   techniques for 2D, 3D, and 4D printing, demonstrating RF devices which
   utilize each dimension and discussing the challenges related to using
   each technology towards microwave designs. Complex, previously
   impossible, modules can be fabricated rapidly setting the foundation for
   the way new designs are prototyped and manufactured.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a novel additive manufacturing process, namely the
   laser melting of polymer-metal colloids (LMC), which is advantageous for
   repairing features and reducing contamination sources. The developed
   polymer-metal colloids are conveyed via the designed spindle-driven
   dispensing system to demonstrate consolidations of the metallic phase
   onto heterogeneous substrate materials via laser melting. Modelling of
   the flow rate, velocity and pressure fields is linked to the geometric
   design of the mechanical devices in the spindle-driven process. The
   equilibriums of the heat transfer equations in the colloid element were
   initiated and presented for the estimations of input laser energy. When
   the input heat was absorbed by the colloid element, the average energy
   density could be obtained by the ratio of the overall energy density and
   the engaged laser scanning volume. In the experimental work of the
   validation tests, the polymer-metal colloid was consolidated on the
   substrate material with three different results: unconsolidated,
   partially consolidated and consolidated. The consolidation and bonding
   of metallic fractions on the heterogeneous substrate materials in the
   laser melting actions were evaluated and reported.},

   technologies: A narrative review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective: To review the elements of the vat-polymerization workflow,
   including the 3D printing parameters, support structures, slicing, and
   post-processing procedures, as well as how these elements affect the
   characteristics of the manufactured dental devices.
   Data: Collection of published articles related to vat-polymerization
   technologies including manufacturing workflow description, and printing
   parameters definition and evaluation of its influence on the mechanical
   properties of vat-polymerized dental devices was performed.
   Sources: Three search engines were selected namely Medline/PubMed,
   EBSCO, and Cochrane. A manual search was also conducted.
   Study selection: The selection of the optimal printing and supporting
   parameters, slicing, and post-processing procedures based on dental
   application is in continuous improvement. As well as their influence on
   the characteristics of the additively manufactured (AM) devices such as
   surface roughness, printing accuracy, and mechanical properties of the
   dental device.
   Results: The accuracy and properties of the AM dental devices are
   influenced by the technology, printer, and material selected. The
   printing parameters, printing structures, slicing methods, and the
   post-processing techniques significantly influence on the surface
   roughness, printing accuracy, and mechanical properties of the
   manufactured dental device; yet, the optimization of each one may vary
   depending on the clinical application of the additively manufactured
   device.
   Conclusions: The printing parameters, supporting structures, slicing,
   and post-processing procedures have been identified, but additional
   studies are needed to establish the optimal manufacturing protocol and
   enhance the properties of the AM polymer dental devices.
   CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The understanding of the factors involved in the
   additive manufacturing workflow leads to a printing success and better
   outcome of the additively manufactured dental device.},

Journal = {MACROMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 7},
Abstract = {The development of tailored additive manufacturing (AM) approaches is
   resulting in novel strategies for engineering the macro/microstructural
   details of potential medical devices made of biocompatible polymers. The
   aim of this work is the employment of a multifunctional AM machine for
   fabricating poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) constructs with a
   predefined shape and porous architecture, by either melt- or
   solution-extrusion AM. In particular, PMMA porous scaffolds are
   manufactured by employing fused filament fabrication (FFF) or
   computer-aided wet-spinning (CAWS). The comparative characterization of
   the two developed PMMA implant prototypes demonstrates significant
   differences in terms of porous structure, polymer surface topography,
   material composition, glass transition temperature, and mechanical
   properties. As a consequence, FFF-printed PMMA samples support a faster
   in vitro proliferation of a murine fibroblast cell line in comparison to
   PMMA scaffolds by CAWS. The results achieved encourage further research
   on the developed processing protocols, aimed at the development of
   tailored PMMA implants for personalized surgery applications.
   A multifunctional additive manufacturing machine is applied to fabricate
   poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) scaffolds by either fused filament
   fabrication or computer-aided wet-spinning. Significant differences in
   terms of morphology, composition, mechanical properties, and in vitro
   cell adhesion between the two developed kinds of PMMA scaffold are
   highlighted in relationship to the different employed processing
   approaches.image},

Journal = {PROGRESS IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 20},
Abstract = {Application of additive manufacturing methods is escalating in numerous
   sectors including the medical field owing to its enhanced productivity,
   functionality, patient-specific fabrication, and affordability. Additive
   manufacturing is considered a digital manufacturing technique that is
   rapidly transforming the medical space in terms of printing distinctive
   body parts with complex shapes and proposing customized and tailored
   resolutions to individual patients. In previous times, Additive
   Manufacturing (AM) is employed as a flexible and profitable technique
   for fabricating geometrically intricate medical organs, dental implants,
   and bones. Though patient-specific implants for bone disease, injury,
   and organ replacement are still a significant challenge for medical
   practitioners and researchers. In spite of the broad studies which were
   concluded on the characteristics of AM materials, there is still a
   necessity for a vigorous understanding of application-specific needs,
   processes, challenges, and considerations related to these techniques.
   Thus, the aim of this study is to present a comprehensive review of the
   most general AM processes, types of materials employed in AM, and
   applications of various AM techniques in the biomedical field. This
   study also outlines current limitations and challenges, which inhibit
   medical sciences to completely benefiting from the advanced AM
   opportunities, comprising production volume, post-processing, standards
   compliance, product quality, materials range, and maintenance.},

Title = {Towards Distributed Recycling with Additive Manufacturing of PET Flake
   Feedstocks},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This study explores the potential to reach a circular economy for
   post-consumer Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate (rPET) packaging and
   bottles by using it as a Distributed Recycling for Additive
   Manufacturing (DRAM) feedstock. Specifically, for the first time, rPET
   water bottle flake is processed using only an open source toolchain with
   Fused Particle Fabrication (FPF) or Fused Granular Fabrication (FGF)
   processing rather than first converting it to filament. In this study,
   first the impact of granulation, sifting, and heating (and their
   sequential combination) is quantified on the shape and size distribution
   of the rPET flakes. Then 3D printing tests were performed on the rPET
   flake with two different feed systems: an external feeder and feed tube
   augmented with a motorized auger screw, and an extruder-mounted hopper
   that enables direct 3D printing. Two Gigabot X machines were used, each
   with the different feed systems, and one without and the latter with
   extended part cooling. 3D print settings were optimized based on thermal
   characterization, and both systems were shown to 3D print rPET directly
   from shredded water bottles. Mechanical testing showed the importance of
   isolating rPET from moisture and that geometry was important for uniform
   extrusion. The mechanical strength of 3D-printed parts with FPF and
   inconsistent flow is lower than optimized fused filament, but adequate
   for a wide range of applications. Future work is needed to improve
   consistency and enable water bottles to be used as a widespread DRAM
   feedstock.},

Title = {Assessing the Radiological Density and Accuracy of Mandible Polymer
   Anatomical Structures Manufactured Using 3D Printing Technologies},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Nowadays, 3D printing technologies are among the rapidly developing
   technologies applied to manufacture even the most geometrically complex
   models, however no techniques dominate in the area of craniofacial
   applications. This study included 12 different anatomical structures of
   the mandible, which were obtained during the process of reconstructing
   data from the Siemens Somatom Sensation Open 40 system. The
   manufacturing process used for the 12 structures involved the use of 8
   3D printers and 12 different polymer materials. Verification of the
   accuracy and radiological density was performed with the CT160Xi
   Benchtop tomography system. The most accurate results were obtained in
   the case of models manufactured using the following materials: E-Model
   (Standard Deviation (SD) = 0.145 mm), FullCure 830 (SD = 0.188 mm),
   VeroClear (SD = 0.128 mm), Digital ABS-Ivory (SD = 0.117 mm), and
   E-Partial (SD = 0.129 mm). In the case of radiological density, ABS-M30
   was similar to spongious bone, PC-10 was similar to the liver, and
   Polylactic acid (PLA) and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were similar
   to the spleen. Acrylic resin materials were able to imitate the
   pancreas, kidney, brain, and heart. The presented results constitute
   valuable guidelines that may improve currently used radiological
   phantoms and may provide support to surgeons in the process of
   performing more precise treatments within the mandible area.},

Journal = {CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Cellulose nanomaterials (CNMs) have attracted great attention in the
   last decades due to the abundance of the biopolymer, the biorenewable
   character and the outstanding mechanical properties they account for.
   These, together with their biocompatibility makes them ideal candidates
   for tissue engineering (TE) applications. Additive manufacturing is an
   ideal biofabrication approach for TE, providing rapid and reliable
   technologies to produce scaffolds aimed for the guidance of host or
   implanted cells to form functional tissues. However, the control of
   parameters at the nanoscale that regulate cellular functions such as
   proliferation and differentiation remain challenging. This review
   article presents the latest advances in the use of CNMs as platforms to
   guide cellular functions in additive manufactured scaffolds. Special
   attention is given to functionalization routes, methods to exploit them
   as topographical cues and to improve the local mechanical properties

Title = {A 3D Printed Morphing Nozzle to Control Fiber Orientation during
   Composite Additive Manufacturing},
Journal = {ADVANCED MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Fiber-filled composite materials offer a unique pathway to enable new
   functionalities for systems built via extrusion-based additive
   manufacturing (or ``3D printing{''}); however, challenges remain in
   controlling the fiber orientations that govern ultimate performance. In
   this work, a multi-material, shape-changing nozzle-constructed by means
   of PolyJet 3D printing-is presented that allows for the spatial
   distribution of short fibers embedded in polymer matrices to be
   modulated on demand throughout extrusion-based deposition processes.
   Specifically, the nozzle comprises flexible bladders that can be
   inflated pneumatically to alter the geometry of the material extrusion
   channel from a straight to a converging-diverging configuration, and in
   turn, the directional orientation of fibers within printed filaments.
   Experimental results for printing carbon microfiber-hydrogel composites
   reveal that increasing the nozzle actuation pressure from 0 to 100 kPa
   reduced the proportion of aligned fibers, and notably, prompted a
   transition from anisotropic to isotropic water-induced swelling
   properties (i.e., the ratio of transverse to longitudinal swelling
   strain decreased from 1.73 +/- 0.37 to 0.93 +/- 0.39, respectively). In
   addition, dynamically varying the nozzle geometry during the extrusion
   of continuous composite filaments effects distinct swelling behaviors in
   adjacent regions, suggesting potential utility of the presented approach
   for emerging ``4D printing{''} applications.},

Title = {Feature Engineering for Surrogate Models of Consolidation Degree in
   Additive Manufacturing},
Journal = {MATERIALS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Surrogate models (SM) serve as a proxy to the physics- and
   experiment-based models to significantly lower the cost of prediction
   while providing high accuracy. Building an SM for additive manufacturing
   (AM) process suffers from high dimensionality of inputs when part
   geometry or tool-path is considered in addition to the high cost of
   generating data from either physics-based models or experiments. This
   paper engineers features for a surrogate model to predict the
   consolidation degree in the fused filament fabrication process. Our
   features are informed by the physics of the underlying thermal processes
   and capture the characteristics of the part's geometry and the
   deposition process. Our model is learned from medium-size data generated
   using a physics-based thermal model coupled with the polymer healing
   theory to determine the consolidation degree. Our results demonstrate
   high accuracy (>90\%) of consolidation degree prediction at a low
   computational cost (four orders of magnitude faster than the numerical
   model).},

Abstract = {Vibration-assisted 3D printing (VAP) is a new direct-write additive
   manufacturing (AM) method that combines the conventional use of back
   pressure with the novel addition of vibrations induced at the syringe
   tip to activate the flow and allow higher-viscosity materials to be
   printed. This work compares the print capabilities of a custom-made VAP
   printer to those of an established commercial printer using polymer
   clay. Characterization tests were conducted comparing the two methods in
   their turning quality. In addition, a variety of other shapes were
   printed by both printers to evaluate feature resolution, unsupported
   overhang angle, negative space feature construction, and
   less-than-fully-dense self-supported 3D lattices. The porosity and
   regularity of the printed lattices were characterized using X-ray
   microtomography (MicroCT) scans. The quality of the shapes was compared
   using statistical methods and a MATLAB edge-finding code. The results
   show that the VAP printer can manufacture parts of superior resolution
   than the commercial printer due to its ability to extrude highly viscous
   material through a smaller nozzle diameter. The VAP print speeds were
   also found to be as high as twenty times those of the direct write
   printer. This work lays the foundation for leveraging AM in the printing
   of highly loaded or viscous shear-thinning inks as a means of improving
   their final quality.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Large structural parts manufactured by Extrusion Additive Manufacturing
   (EAM) are limited by strong anisotropy due to insufficient bond
   formation and reduced molecular entanglement along the layer interface.
   To understand the correlation between process and material parameters
   and to enable digital modeling of EAM, the effect of different substrate
   temperatures and layer heights on tensile strength was investigated. A
   simple testing methodology for pelletized carbon fiber-filled polyamide
   6 was developed. Tensile tests were performed in a full factorial Design
   of Experiments (DoE) to determine the tensile properties. For bulk
   simulation, the nominal strength and modulus were also determined based
   on contact width obtained by optical microscopy. The results
   demonstrated high anisotropy, with the maximum transverse tensile
   strength reaching only 27\% of the corresponding longitudinal results
   and the transverse tensile modulus reaching only 20\% of its
   longitudinal value. The effects of varying layer height were less
   significant than varying substrate temperature. The results support the
   hypothesis that sufficient transverse tensile strength is achieved
   between the extrapolated crystallization onset and melt temperature. The
   methodology of this study can be used as a benchmark method to qualify
   new thermoplastic polymers for EAM processes and to determine optimal
   process parameters for improved fusion bonding.},

Abstract = {ABSTRACT: We demonstrate tunable structural color patterns that span the
   visible spectrum using atomic layer deposition (ALD). Asymmetric
   metal-dielectric-metal structures were sequentially deposited with
   nickel, zinc oxide, and a thin copper layer to form an optical cavity.
   The color response was precisely adjusted by tuning the zinc oxide (ZnO)
   thickness using ALD, which was consistent with model predictions. Owing
   to the conformal nature of ALD, this allows for uniform and tunable
   coloration of nonplanar three-dimensional (3D) objects, as exemplified
   by adding color to 3D-printed parts produced by metal additive
   manufacturing. Proper choice of inorganic layered structures and
   materials allows the structural color to be stable at elevated
   temperatures, in contrast to traditional paints. To print multiple
   colors on a single sample, polymer inhibitors were patterned in a
   desired geometry using electrohydrodynamic jet (e-jet) printing,
   followed by area-selective ALD in the unpassivated regions. The ability
   to achieve 3D color printing, both at the micro- and macroscales,
   provides a new pathway to tune the optical and aesthetic properties
   during additive manufacturing.},

Abstract = {Additive Manufacturing (AM) is the significantly progressing field in
   terms of methods, materials, and performance of fabricated parts.
   Periodical evaluation on the understanding of AM processes and its
   evolution is needed since the field is growing rapidly. To address this
   requirement, this paper presents a detailed review of the Additive
   Manufacturing (AM) methods, materials used, and challenges associated
   with them. A critical review of the state of art materials in the
   categories such as metals and alloys, polymers, ceramics, and
   biomaterials are presented along with their applications, benefits, and
   the problems associated with the formation of microstructures,
   mechanical properties, and controlling process parameters. The
   perspectives and the status of different materials on the fabrication of
   thin-walled structures using AM techniques have also been discussed.
   Additionally, the main challenges with AM techniques such as inaccuracy,
   surface quality, reinforcement distribution, and other common problems
   identified from the literature are presented. On the whole, this paper
   provides a comprehensive outlook on AM techniques, challenges, and
   future research directions.},

Abstract = {For practical applications of the MFC technology, the design as well as
   the processes of manufacturing and assembly, should be optimised for the
   specific target use. Another burgeoning technology, additive
   manufacturing (3D printing), can contribute significantly to this
   approach by offering a high degree of design freedom. In this study, we
   investigated the use of commercially available 3D printable polymer
   materials as the MFC membrane and anode. The best performing membrane
   material, Gel-Lay, produced a maximum power of 240 +/- 11 mu W, which
   was 1.4-fold higher than the control CEM with PMAX of 177 +/- 29 mu W.
   Peak power values of Gel-Lay (133.8-184.6 mu W) during fed-batch cycles
   were also higher than the control (133.4-160.5 mu W). In terms of
   material cost, the tested membranes were slightly higher than the
   control CEM, primarily due to the small purchased quantity. Finally, the
   first 3D printable polymer anode, a conductive PLA material, showed
   significant potential as a low-cost and easy to fabricate MFC anode,
   producing a stable level of power output, despite poor conductivity and
   relatively small surface area per unit volume. These results demonstrate
   the practicality of monolithic MFC fabrication with individually
   optimised components at relatively low cost. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Title = {Characterisation of carbon fibre-reinforced polyamide manufactured by
   selective laser sintering},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {7-13},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Polymers and reinforced plastics are employed in various load-bearing
   applications, from household objects to aerospace products. These
   materials are light, strong, and relatively cheap but can be difficult
   to form into complex geometries. However, the development of additive
   manufacturing processes has made it easier to manufacture reinforced
   plastics in complex shapes. The aim of this work was to study the
   internal features and mechanical properties of carbon fibre-reinforced
   polyamide (CF/PA12) fabricated with the additive manufacturing technique
   of selective laser sintering. The test specimens were studied using
   computed tomography to analyse the internal geometry, and the material
   proved to be highly porous. Moreover, the test specimens revealed an
   internal layered structure, which was found to have a great effect on
   the tensile properties of the material. The results highlight that there
   is room for further optimisation of the manufacturing parameters for
   CF/PA12, because the layered structure makes it challenging to design
   end user parts with acceptable mechanical properties. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {3D printing, more formally known as Additive Manufacturing (AM), is
   already being adopted for rapid prototyping and soon rapid
   manufacturing. This review provides a brief discussion about AM and also
   the most employed AM technologies for polymers. The commonly-used ASTM
   and ISO mechanical test standards which have been used by various
   research groups to test the strength of the 3D-printed parts have been
   reported. Also, a summary of an exhaustive amount of literature
   regarding the mechanical properties of 3D-printed parts is included,
   specifically, properties under different loading types such as tensile,
   bending, compressive, fatigue, impact and others. Properties at low
   temperatures have also been discussed. Further, the effects of fillers
   as well as post-processing on the mechanical properties have also been
   discussed. Lastly, several important questions to consider in the
   standardization of mechanical test methods have been raised. (C) 2017

   write of polymer nanocomposites},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Inorganic-polymer hybrid colloids present a modular and tunable route to
   fabricate polymer nanocomposites from low viscosity precursors; however,
   their use in additive manufacturing remains limited. This manuscript
   describes photocurable ``hybrid colloids{''} to enable layered
   fabrication of elastomeric nanocomposites, i.e., combination of
   continuous-phase photocrosslinking chemistry with hybrid colloids of
   water-dispersible silica nanoparticles and styrene-butadiene rubber
   (SBR) latex particles. Varying the relative concentrations of polymeric
   and inorganic particles afforded precise tuning of filler loading in the
   final nanocomposite and introduced a bimodal particle size distribution
   with desirable rheological behavior for extrusion-based additive
   manufacturing. Specifically, ultraviolet-assisted direct ink write
   (UV-DIW) processing of the photocurable hybrid colloid pastes generated
   free-standing green bodies, which contained a combination of SBR and
   silica nanoparticles. Subsequent drying of the green bodies allowed SBR
   particle coalescence and penetration through the scaffold and
   surrounding the silica nanoparticles, which yielded a
   semi-interpenetrating network (sIPN) nanocomposite. Facile tuning of
   silica concentrations in the hybrid colloid enabled tuning of both the
   colloidal ink rheology and mechanical properties of the final sIPN
   nanocomposites to achieve additive manufacturing of silica-SBR
   nanocomposites with ultimate tensile strains exceeding 300 \% and
   ultimate tensile strengths above 10 MPa.},

   by day due to their ability to produce very complex shapes or
   geometries. Investigating the fracture and fatigue behavior of
   additively manufactured parts are essential not only to understand their
   mechanical response but also to predict and prevent their failure. In
   this study, fracture and fatigue properties of additively manufactured
   polymers are investigated experimentally combining the servohydraulic
   material testing system (MTS 810) and the three-dimensional digital
   image correlation technology. The polymers used for the analysis are
   acrylonitrile styrene acrylate (ASA) and Onyx, which are readily
   available and more prevalent in AM applications. Both notched (i.e.,
   pre-cracked) and unnotched specimens are printed in the edge and flat
   orientations by the fused deposition modeling printer in the shape of
   the standard ASTM sub-size flat dogbone structure. The tensile strain is
   studied ahead of the crack formation, and the crack propagation is
   observed in the photos obtained from the digital image correlation
   system. A finite element model of similar contemplation is generated for
   the validation and extended results. Results show that the orientation
   of manufacturing has a noticeable effect on the failure of the specimen.
   In the unnotched specimens, the crack occurs near the neck due to a
   high-stress concentration. Results for the high cycle fatigue test
   indicate that fatigue life decreases as the load increases for all types
   of specimens.},

   eco-friendly aliphatic polyketone},

Abstract = {Aliphatic polyketone is a new-age eco-friendly, high-performance
   engineering thermoplastic. However, its potential for replacing other
   polymers depends on its ability to be processed. Considering that the
   first aliphatic polyketone suitable for processing was developed
   relatively recently (2015), the material gained new research potential.
   In this paper screw extrusion-based process was developed for additive
   manufacturing of aliphatic polyketone. A detailed characterisation of
   the process and printed samples was done. It was shown that the
   extruder-base process can produce stable additivemanufactured parts
   depending on printing speed (process parameters). The interpass
   temperature has a significant influence on printing properties and it
   depends on printing speed (travel speed of building platform and
   extruder rotational speed). With the increase in the printing speed, the
   interpass temperature increases as well. If it is low causes
   insufficient heat for diffusion to occur causing delamination and if it
   is too high causes geometrical deviation of workpieces which leads to
   defects causing a reduction in interroad strength. The tensile strength
   of specimens with raster angle 0 degrees was 62.7 +/- 1.4 MPa, which is
   slightly higher than the tensile strength of base material guaranteed by
   the supplier (60 MPa) while the elongation up to the first crack was
   32.8 +/- 4.6\%. Iinter-road strength in specimens with a raster angle of
   90 degrees was 37.2 +/- 0.8 MPa which is 62\% of the base material while
   interpass temperature was 189 +/- 3.3 degrees C.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

Abstract = {Impellers are referred to as a core component of turbomachinery. The use
   of impellers in various applications is considered an integral part of
   the industry. So, increased performance and the optimization of
   impellers have been the center of attention of a lot of studies. In this
   regard, studies have been focused on the improvement of the efficiency
   of rotary machines through aerodynamic optimization, using
   high-performance materials and suitable manufacturing processes. As
   such, the use of polymers and polymer composites due to their lower
   weight when compared to metals has been the focus of studies. On the
   other hand, methods of the manufacturing process for polymer and polymer
   composite impellers such as conventional impeller manufacturing,
   injection molding and additive manufacturing can offer higher economic
   efficiency than similar metal parts. In this study, polymeric and
   polymer composites impellers are discussed and conclusions are drawn
   according to the manufacturing methods. Studies have shown promising
   results for the replacement of polymers and polymer composites instead
   of metals with respect to a suitable temperature range. In general,
   polymers showed a good ability to fabricate the impellers, however in
   more difficult working conditions considering the need for a substance
   with higher physical and mechanical properties necessitates the use of
   composite polymers. However, in some applications, the use of these
   materials needs further research and development.},

Journal = {MATERIALS TODAY PHYSICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {20},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Functional metastructures exhibiting unique optical properties are
   desirable for advancements in microfluidics, optoelectronics, nonlinear
   photonics, biochemical sensing, and metamaterials. Additive
   manufacturing techniques are expected to enable rapid prototyping of
   complex 3D architectonics required for such applications. We report the
   fabrication of highly fluorescent all-organic metastructures via carbon
   quantum dot assisted in-situ polymerization of acrylate and carbon dot
   composite resin. The polymerized structures fabricated from acrylate and
   carbon dot composite resin exhibit excellent linear and nonlinear
   optical properties due to the presence of two-photon active carbon
   quantum dots incorporated in the resin. By activating the two-photon
   process, we eliminated the need for adding two-photon absorbing toxic
   chemicals for initiating the polymerization process. The fabrication of
   functional nanostructures using acrylate and carbon dot composite resin
   opens the door for rapid prototyping of metastructures for various
   applications such as developing functional metamaterials, solid-state
   lighting, live monitoring of cells in cultures, fluorescent tagging and
   detection of counterfeiting among others. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The paper addresses the prototypical development and implementation of
   an innovative and functionally integrated gear stage for next-generation
   electric vehicles, produced by using Laser Beam Melting (LBM) and Fused
   Deposition Modeling (FDM). Two new design targets are addressed by our
   approach: Oil-free operation is achieved by innovative coating of gear
   teeth which enables almost maintenance-free operation. Furthermore, a
   higher damping of sound transmission from tooth mesh to bearings is
   implemented by an optimal wheel body geometry that is realized by a
   combination of printable carbon-containing polymers (flange) and steel
   (gear rim). The innovative approach is to extend components by areas
   that cannot be produced by milling and casting, e.g. complex structures,
   contour-following fluid-carrying cooling elements by means of LBM, thus
   creating a significant benefit compared to state-of-the-art gearboxes.
   Function integration made possible by additive manufacturing results in
   a very high component complexity. It is combined with gear grinding and
   final ta-C coatings ensuring maximum efficiency in dry operation, to
   achieve economically viable production processes. The increase in tooth
   mesh efficiency is achieved by optimization approaches in the design to
   minimize heat losses while at the same time maintaining highest possible
   strength and lowest noise emission.},

   Pellet Extrusion-Based Additive Manufacturing},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Recent developments in additive manufacturing have moved towards a new
   trend in material extrusion processes (ISO/ASTM 52910:2018), dealing
   with the direct extrusion of thermoplastic and composite material from
   pellets. This growing interest is driven by the reduction of costs,
   environmental impact, energy consumption, and the possibility to
   increase the range of printable materials. Pellet additive manufacturing
   (PAM) can cover the same applications as fused filament fabrication
   (FFF), and in addition, can lead to scale towards larger workspaces that
   cannot be covered by FFF, due to the limited diameters of standard
   filaments. In the first case, the process is known as micro- or
   mini-extrusion (MiE) in the literature, in the second case the
   expression big area additive manufacturing (BAAM) is very common.
   Several models are available in literature regarding filament extrusion,
   while there is a lack of modeling of the extrusion dynamics in PAM.
   Physical and chemical phenomena involved in PAM have high overlap with
   those characterizing injection molding (IM). Therefore, a systematic
   study of IM literature can lead to a selection of the most promising
   models for PAM, both for lower (MiE) and larger (BAAM) extruder
   dimensions. The models concerning the IM process have been reviewed with
   this aim: the extraction of information useful for the development of
   codes able to predict thermo-fluid dynamics performances of PAM
   extruders.},

Title = {Space Qualification of Metalized Additive Manufactured Filters},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {96952-96966},
Abstract = {The space industry is seeking new solutions for the development of
   lightweight, inexpensive and easy-to-manufacture on-board communication
   payload devices. One of the proposed technologies is additive
   manufacturing (AM) of polymeric materials that are subsequently
   metallized. The devices developed using this technique must be
   operational in the particular space environment conditions. In this work
   we study the integrity of filters made by additive manufacturing against
   the extreme conditions of mechanical stress, temperature and power
   management as described in the standard of the European Space Agency
   (ESA) for satellite payload. To carry out this qualification for space,
   two types of X-band filters with identical frequency responses have been
   designed and manufactured: a classic H-plane waveguide cavities filter,
   and three filters on surface-mount technology (SMT). Two of the SMT
   filters are low height rectangular cavities filters, while the third one
   is a high circular cavities filter. This selection was intended to
   verify that the AM technique offered good results regardless of the
   devices topology. Two mechanical vibration tests were performed:
   sinusoidal sweep and random vibration. These tests emulate the transport
   and launching conditions of the satellite payload. Furthermore, it was
   measured the mechanical natural frequency of the filters, and its
   variation after being exposed to the tests in order to evaluate their
   physical integrity. The thermal analysis was performed emulating the
   temperature profile experienced by the satellite payload during working
   conditions. Then, the power handling tests were carried out. The
   secondary electron emission yield of the material (metallized polymer)
   was firstly measured. The power levels, location and frequency at which
   a multipactor discharge would occur were analyzed for both, low-height
   and standard-height, filters. Finally, both filters were subjected to
   those power levels, under high vacuum conditions, to check if the said
   multipactor discharges occurred. The mechanical stress and temperature
   tests prove that the developed filters can survive the hard launching
   and operation conditions of commercial satellite payloads. The
   multipactor tests report the high power levels that the devices can
   handle without risk of radiofrequency (RF) breakage. All these tests
   allow to fully qualify the proposed manufacturing technique for spatial
   applications.},

Title = {Manufacturing and Characterization of 3D Miniature Polymer Lattice
   Structures Using Fused Filament Fabrication},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The potential of additive manufacturing to produce architected lattice
   structures is remarkable, but restrictions imposed by manufacturing
   processes lead to practical limits on the form and dimension of
   structures that can be produced. In the present work, the capabilities
   of fused filament fabrication (FFF) to produce miniature lattices were
   explored, as they represent an inexpensive option for the production of
   polymer custom-made lattice structures. First, fused filament
   fabrication design guidelines were tested to assess their validity for
   miniature unit cells and lattice structures. The predictions were
   contrasted with the results of printing tests, showing some
   discrepancies between expected outcomes and resulting printed
   structures. It was possible to print functional 3D miniature open cell
   polymer lattice structures without support, even when some FFF
   guidelines were infringed, i.e., recommended minimum strut thickness and
   maximum overhang angle. Hence, a broad range of lattice structures with
   complex topologies are possible, beyond the cubic-type cell
   arrangements. Nevertheless, there are hard limits in 3D printing of
   miniature lattice structures. Strut thickness, length and orientation
   were identified as critical parameters in miniature lattice structures.
   Printed lattices that did not fully comply with FFF guidelines were
   capable of bearing compressive loads, even if surface quality and
   accuracy issues could not be fully resolved. Nevertheless, 3D printed
   FFF lattice structures could represent an improvement compared to other
   additive manufacturing processes, as they offer good control of cell
   geometry, and does not require additional post-processing.},

Abstract = {Poly-lactic acid (PLA) is the most promising polymer in additive
   manufacturing as an alternative to acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
   (ABS). Since it is produced from renewable resources such as corn starch
   and sugar beets, it is also biocompatible and biodegradable. However,
   PLA has a couple of issues that limit its use. First, it has a
   comparatively low glass transition temperature of around 60 \& DEG;C,
   such that it exhibits low thermal resistance. Second, PLA has low impact
   strength because it is brittle. Due to these problems, scientists have
   found methods to improve the crystallinity and ductility of PLA.
   Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is one of the most studied plasticizers for
   PLA to give it chain mobility. However, the blend of PLA and PEG becomes
   unstable, and phase separation occurs even at room temperature as PEG is
   self-crystallized. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the optimal
   mixing ratio of PLA-PEG at the molecular scale. In this study, molecular
   dynamics will be conducted with various ratios of L-type PLA (PLLA) or
   DL-type PLA-PEG (PDLA-PEG) systems by using BIOVIA Materials Studio.},

Abstract = {This paper examines a novel additive manufacturing (AM) technique for
   the fabrication of woven multilaminate composites. The printing studies
   were carried out using nylon coated carbon fibre Tow in the form of a
   filament. This pathing technique allows for a woven structure to be
   integrated with features (such as notches) previously only possible
   through destructive machining processes. In order to evaluate the
   performance of these printed composites, bearing response studies were
   carried out 6 mm holes were routed into a multilaminate woven composite
   structure, the resulting part's mechanical performance was then tested
   and compared with specimens which had been drilled post printing.
   Specimen were comprised of 9 woven laminates stacked to form a 3.1 mm
   thick standardised test coupon for single and double shear testing (ASTM
   D5961) Current industry standard machining techniques result in fibre
   discontinuity and damage, this results in suboptimal mechanical
   performance of composite components. These new `Tailor Woven' specimens
   achieved single shear bearing strengths of up to 214 MPa and double
   shear bearing strengths of up to 276 MPa. These values represent an
   increase of 29\% and 63\% respectively compared with equivalent
   composites in which the hole had been drilled.},

Abstract = {A new additive manufacturing (AM) approach to fabricate long fiber
   reinforced composites (LFRC) was proposed in this study. A high
   deposition rate was achieved by the implementation of a single-screw
   extruder, which directly used thermoplastic pellets and continuous fiber
   tows as feedstock materials. Thus, the proposed method was also used as
   a large-scale additive manufacturing (LSAM) method for printing
   large-volume components. Using polylactic acid (PLA) pellets and
   continuous carbon fiber tows, the feasibility of the proposed AM method
   was investigated through printing LFRC samples and further demonstrated
   by fabricating large-volume components with complex geometries. The
   printed LFRC samples were compared with pure thermoplastic and
   continuous fiber reinforced composite (CFRC) counterparts via mechanical
   tests and microstructural analyses. With comparable flexural modulus,
   the flexural strength of the LFRC samples was slightly lower than that
   of the CFRC samples. An average improvement of 28\% in flexural strength
   and 50\% in flexural modulus were achieved compared to those of pure PLA
   parts, respectively. Discontinuous long carbon fibers, with an average
   fiber length of 20.1 mm, were successfully incorporated into the printed
   LFRC samples. The carbon fiber orientation, distribution of carbon fiber
   length, and dispersion of carbon fiber as well as porosity were further
   studied. The carbon fibers were highly oriented along the printing
   direction with a relatively uniformly distributed fiber reinforcement
   across the LFRC cross section. With high deposition rate (up to 0.8
   kg/hr) and low material costs (<\$10/kg), this study demonstrated the
   potentials of the proposed printing method in LSAM of high strength
   polymer composites reinforced with long carbon fibers.},

Abstract = {A facile manufacturing method to enable the in situ foam 3D printing of
   thermoplastic materials is reported. An expandable feedstock filament
   was first made by incorporation of thermally expandable microspheres
   (TEMs) in the filament during the extrusion process. The material
   formulation and extrusion process were designed such that TEM expansion
   was suppressed during filament fabrication. Polylactic acid (PLA) was
   used as a model material, and filaments containing 2.0 wt \% triethyl
   citrate and 0.0-5.0 wt \% TEM were fabricated. Expandable filaments were
   then fed into a material extrusion additive manufacturing process to
   enable the in situ foaming of microcellular structures during layer
   deposition. The mesostructure, cellular morphology, thermal behavior,
   and mechanical properties of the printed foams were investigated.
   Repeatable foam prints with highly uniform cellular structures were
   successfully achieved. The part density was reduced with an increase in
   the TEM content, with a maximum reduction of 50\% at 5.0 wt \% TEM
   content. It is also remarkable that the interbead gaps of mesostructure
   vanished due to the local polymer expansion during in situ foaming. The
   incorporation of TEM and plasticizer only slightly lowered the critical
   temperatures of PLA, that is, glass-transition, melting, and
   decomposition temperatures. Moreover, with the introduction of foaming,
   the specific tensile strength and modulus decreased, whereas the
   ductility and toughness increased severalfold. The results unveil the
   feasibility of a novel additive manufacturing technology that offers
   numerous opportunities toward the manufacturing of specially designed
   structures including functionally graded foams for a variety of
   applications.},

Abstract = {Direct-metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes such as Selective
   Laser Melting (SLM) and Electron Beam Melting (EBM) methods are being
   used to fabricate complex metallic cellular structures with a laser or
   electron beam over a metal powder bed. Even though these processes have
   excellent capabilities to fabricate parts with cellular mesostructures,
   there exist several constraints in the processes and applications:
   limited selection of materials, high thermal stress by the high local
   energy source, poor surface finish, and anisotropic properties of parts
   caused by combined effects of one-dimensional (1D) energy based
   patterning mechanism, the deposition layer thickness, powder size, power
   and travel speed of laser or electron beam. In addition, manufacturing
   cost is still high with the Direct-metal AM processes. As an alternative
   for manufacturing metallic 3D cellular structures, which can overcome
   the disadvantages of direct-metal AM techniques, polymer AM methods may
   be combined with metal casting. We may call this ``Indirect AM based
   Casting (I AM casting){''}. The objective of this study is to explore
   the potential of I AM Casting associated with development of a novel
   manufacturing process - Indirect 3D Printing based centrifugal casting
   which is capable of producing multifunctional metallic cellular
   structures with internal cooling channels having a 2mm inner diameter
   and 0.5mm wall thickness. We characterize polymers by making expendable
   patterns with a polyj et type 3D printer; e.g., modulus, strength,
   melting and glass transition temperatures and thermal expansion
   coefficients. A transient flow and heat transfer analysis of molten
   metal through 3D cellular network mold will be conducted. Solidification
   of molten metal through cellular mold during casting will be simulated
   with temperature dependent properties of molten metal and mold over a
   range of running temperatures. The volume of fluid (VOF) method will be
   implemented to simulate the solidification of molten metal together with
   a user defined function (UDF) of ANSYS/FLUENT. Finally, experimental
   validation will be conducted.},

Title = {Regulatory Considerations for Devices Manufactured Using Additive
   Manufacturing Technologies},
Booktitle = {POLYMER-BASED ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING: BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Pages = {243-254},
Abstract = {This chapter reviews the regulatory framework for medical devices
   manufactured using additive manufacturing technologies in various
   countries and regions. The medical device regulations and guidelines
   published by these countries stipulate the specific regulatory
   requirements which medical device manufacturers must fulfil in order to
   bring their devices into the market. This chapter reviews the current
   regulations concerning, in particular, CE marking and US FDA regulation,
   and provides an overview of the Australian, Canadian, Brazilian and
   Japanese regulations. The review discusses routes of conformity for
   medical devices, device classification requirements and considerations
   when making changes to mass-produced medical devices. The methods which
   manufacturers can use to bring devices, such as custom-made medical
   devices, to the market will also be outlined. The review found that a
   regulatory framework currently exists to bring devices manufactured
   using additive manufacturing technologies to market. This framework,
   however, is more evolved in some countries in comparison to others, in
   particular, in relation to testing considerations for devices
   manufactured using such practices. Additionally, clarity would prove
   beneficial for manufacturers in relation to, for example, specific
   regulatory guidance documents from the regulatory authorities.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) techniques(1) can produce complex,
   high-value metal parts, with potential applications as critical parts,
   such as those found in aerospace components. The production of AM parts
   with consistent and predictable properties requires input materials
   (e.g., metal powders) with known and repeatable characteristics, which
   in turn requires standardized measurement methods for powder properties.
   First, based on our previous work, we assess the applicability of
   current standardized methods for powder characterization for metal AM
   powders. Then we present the results of systematic studies carried out
   on two different powder materials used for additive manufacturing:
   stainless steel and cobalt-chrome. The characterization of these powders
   is important in NIST efforts to develop appropriate measurements and
   standards for additive materials and to document the property of powders
   used in a NIST-led additive manufacturing material round robin. An
   extensive array of characterization techniques was applied to these two
   powders, in both virgin and recycled states. The physical techniques
   included laser diffraction particle size analysis, X-ray computed
   tomography for size and shape analysis, and optical and scanning
   electron microscopy. Techniques sensitive to structure and chemistry,
   including X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive analytical X-ray analysis
   using the X-rays generated during scanning electron microscopy, and
   X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy were also employed. The results of
   these analyses show how virgin powder changes after being exposed to and
   recycled from one or more Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) additive
   manufacturing build cycles. In addition, these findings can give insight
   into the actual additive manufacturing process.},

Abstract = {In the modern industry the necessity to realize products with given
   specifications requires the use of proper tools. In particular, the
   realization of prototypes or the possibility to realize directly the
   product without customized tools can be allowed with less time consuming
   by additive manufacturing instead of conventional techniques. The
   present research aims at investigating the effect of a complex geometry
   on dimensional and surface quality of a component made by additive
   manufacturing of UV treatable polymers by a poly-jet system. A
   semi-ellipsoid surface was generated on two main B-spline lines realized
   with different curvatures using six control points each. The CAD
   information was converted into a STL and a slicing interval less than
   0.05 mm applied. The effect of the two building directions imposed to
   the nozzle with respect to the two main profiles of the surface was
   evaluated in terms of surface waviness and staircase. Due to the
   complexity of the geometry, the shape information was detected by a 3D
   SCANNER. The shape of the photopolymerized model was in excellent
   agreement with that of CAD and the 3D SCANNER was able to detect
   waviness and staircase. The methodology proposed and results are
   reported in detail. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The present review elaborates about the intricacy being associated with

   process for additive manufacturing (AM) of metal and ceramic components.
   Hybridization of FFF and metal injection moulding enables sustainable

   hybrid process, it involves optimization of various interlinked
   parameters; for this reason, the present review deliberately provides
   analysis of consolidated and comparative information of research work
   previously carried out for this process. As conclusively perceived, the
   present perspective of this review provides an approach of incorporating
   FFF-based hybrid AM technique, with benefits such as reduced capital
   expenditure, ease in processing and ability to manufacture parts from
   distinct variety of materials like metals, ceramics, polymers, etc.,
   using the same setup.},

Abstract = {Novel powder systems of good processability are essential to broaden the
   fields of application of powder-based Additive Manufacturing (AM)
   processes like selective laser sintering (SLS). Within this contribution
   a novel approach for production of semi-crystalline polycarbonate (PC)
   micron-sized particles is presented. The PC particles produced by
   liquid-liquid phase separation are thoroughly characterized with respect
   to powder and material properties using laser diffraction particle
   sizing, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy,
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-Ray diffraction (XRD).
   Remarkably, starting from amorphous feed material the process allows to
   obtain spherical semi-crystalline PC particles opening a thermal
   `process window' for selective laser sintering. Dry particle coating
   with fumed silica further improves the flowability of the product
   particles. The powders' SLS processability was assessed by tensile
   strength measurements and powder deposition experiments, Dense thin
   layer specimen could be successfully built using the novel PC powder.

Abstract = {Advances in organic photovoltaic technologies have been geared toward
   industrial high-throughput printing manufacturing, which requires
   insensitivity of photovoltaic performance regarding to the
   light-harvesting layer thickness. However, the thickness of
   light-harvesting layer for all polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) is often
   limited to about 100 nm due to the dramatically decreased fill factor
   upon increasing film thickness, which hampers the light harvesting
   capability to increase the power conversion efficiency, and is
   unfavorable for fabricating large-area devices. Here we demonstrate that
   by tuning the bulk heterojunction morphology using a non-halogenated
   solvent, cyclopentyl methyl ether, in the presence of a green solvent
   additive of dibenzyl ether, the power conversion efficiency of all-PSCs
   with photoactive layer thicknesses of over 500 nm reached an
   impressively high value of 9\%. The generic applicability of this green
   solvent additive to boost the power conversion efficiency of thick-film
   devices is also validated in various bulk heterojunction active layer
   systems, thus representing a promising approach for the fabrication of
   all-PSCs toward industrial production, as well as further
   commercialization.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) using metal materials can be used to
   manufacture metal parts with complex shapes that are difficult to
   manufacture with subtractive processing. Recently, numerous commercial
   AM machines for metallic materials have been developed. The primary
   types of AM using metallic materials are powder bed fusion or direct
   energy deposition. Other types using metallic materials have not been
   adequately studied. In this study, the use of the material extrusion
   (ME) type of AM is investigated. The aim is to use metallic materials
   not only for fabricating metal parts but also for adding various
   properties to base materials, e.g., electric conductivity, thermal
   conductivity, weight, strength, and color of plastics. ME is appropriate
   for use with various materials by mixing different types of filler.
   However, there is a problem in that the high density of metal fillers
   generates unstable extrusion. Therefore, ultrasonic vibration was used
   for assisting extrusion. A prototype system was developed using an
   extrusion nozzle vibrated by an ultrasonic homogenizer. The experimental
   results showed that the ultrasonic vibration allows materials to be
   extruded smoothly. Three dimensional (3D) shapes could be built by
   multi-layer deposition with a thixotropic polymer containing a highly
   concentrated steel powder. As one application, a 3D-shaped object was
   fabricated as a sintered object. After the vibration effect in the
   extrusion process of steel powder and clay was confirmed, a 3D object
   built by the proposed method was sintered through a baking process.},

Abstract = {Digital manufacturing technologies {[}1] are gaining more and more
   importance as key enabling technologies in future manufacturing,
   especially when a flexible scalable manufacturing of small medium series
   of customized parts is required. The paper describes a new approach for
   design manufacturing of complex three dimensional components building on
   a combination of digital manufacturing technologies such as laminated
   objects manufacturing, laser and e-printing technologies. The micro
   component is made up of stacks of functionalized layers of polymer
   films. The concept is currently developed further in the project
   SMARTLAM {[}2,3], funded by the European Commission. The manufacturing
   system is based on a flexible, scalable and modular equipment and
   application features approach which enables the manufacturing of
   different small size batches without tool or mask making in short time.
   Different modules can be combined by defined hardware and software
   interfaces. Avoiding time consumable and difficult programming caused by
   manufacturing a new conceptual approach a Function-Block Runtime (FORTE)
   executes generated control application platform-independently and
   coordinates component module functionalities. The control system is
   designed to integrate all processes as well as the base platform with
   features far beyond ordinary PLC systems. One aspect is the use of
   process data out of the data acquisition system to simulate and optimize
   the processes. These results are incorporated into the main machine
   control system. Another aspect is the vision system for flexible quality
   control and closed loop positioning control with visual servoing.
   The paper shows the overall concept of SMARTLAM and exemplarily
   demonstrates the control system as well as the modular equipment
   approach by the example of the control system for alignment of different
   stacks and inspection system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The process simulation tool Additive3D has been developed in Abaqus(C)
   2017 to model the Extrusion Deposition Additive Manufacturing (EDAM)
   process for fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites. This additive
   manufacturing (AM) method encompasses material deposition processes
   where geometries are constructed layer by layer and the resulting layer
   properties are highly anisotropic.
   The goal is to predict final deformed shapes and residual stresses of
   printed geometries due to the printing process and the material
   anisotropy. The resulting design tool allows to assess the outcomes of
   the printing process based on the part geometry, the printing material
   and the position control parameters.
   Material properties were characterized, and validation experiments,
   without additional calibration, show an excellent agreement between
   modeled and measured part deformation states with relative deviations
   below 7\%. Due to the physics-based nature of the developed simulation
   tools, the simulations can be extended to account for different part
   scales, printing materials and printing histories.},

Abstract = {Engineered nanomaterials, where at least one dimension is within 1-100
   nm, are produced and used in many consumer products, with the purpose of
   enhancing specific material properties (e. g., in plastic products).
   Conventionally, organic and inorganic non-engineered nanomaterial
   additives are also used to enhance material properties. The aim of this
   study is to perform life cycle assessments (LCAs) on 5 polymer products
   (polypropylene air-conditioner part for cars, polypropylene garden
   chair, polypropylene small electrical box for houses,
   polyvinylchloride-wood outdoor flooring and polystyrene insulation
   panels for buildings). Antibacterial, ultraviolet ray protection or
   flame retardancy properties of these products have been improved through
   the addition of either Ag, ZnO or Mg(OH)(2) engineered nanomaterials, or
   conventional organic/inorganic polymer additives. The study also
   presents new industrial production inventories of the considered
   engineered nanomaterials as well as the quantification of potential
   changes in impacts when the LCA functional unit is adjusted according to
   material functionality (antibacterial, ultraviolet-protection and flame
   retardancy). The LCA results show that in all cases the products with
   engineered nanomaterials generate higher potential environmental impacts
   than products with conventional additives. However, when considering the
   improved material functionality results differ more. The
   polyvinylchloride-wood outdoor flooring and polystyrene insulation
   panels for buildings with engineered nanomaterials perform better than
   with the use of conventional additives, while the polypropylene products
   with engineered nanomaterials have slightly higher environmental impacts
   than products with conventional additives. In the case of polypropylene
   small electrical box the needed large content of micro-Mg(OH)(2) makes
   the engineered nanomaterial case far less favourable, but if Mg(OH)(2)
   substitutes halogenated flame retardants the potential toxicological
   impacts are shown to be significantly lower. This study shows that the
   consideration of enhanced material functionality in LCA can favour some
   of the engineered nanomaterial based products, versus conventional
   additives, by reflecting the potential increase in use quality and
   potentially the use time. Also in this study, based on assumed release
   amounts, freshwater ecotoxicity caused by engineered nanomaterial
   release from products is quantifiedshowing a novel approach.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The research described in this paper is dedicated to the use of
   continuous fibers as reinforcement for additive manufacturing,
   particularly using Shotcrete. Composites and in particular fiber
   reinforced polymers (FRP) are increasingly present in concrete
   reinforcement. Their corrosion resistance, high tensile strength, low
   weight, and high flexibility offer an interesting alternative to
   conventional steel reinforcement, especially with respect to their use
   in Concrete 3D Printing. This paper presents an initial development of a
   dynamic robot-based manufacturing process for FRP concrete reinforcement
   as an innovative way to increase shape freedom and efficiency in
   concrete construction. The focus here is on prefabricated fiber
   reinforcement, which is concreted in a subsequent additive process to
   produce load-bearing components. After the presentation of the
   fabrication concept for the integration of FRP reinforcement and the
   state of the art, a requirements analysis regarding the mechanical
   bonding behavior in concrete is carried out. This is followed by a
   description of the development of a dynamic fiber winding process and
   its integration into an automated production system for individualized
   fiber reinforcement. Next, initial tests for the automated application
   of concrete by means of Shotcrete 3D Printing are carried out. In
   addition, an outlook describes further technical development steps and
   provides an outline of advanced manufacturing concepts for additive
   concrete manufacturing with integrated fiber reinforcement.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to compile the successful
   implementation of three-dimensional (3D) printing in the space for the
   manufacturing of complex parts. 3D printing is an additive manufacturing
   (AM) technique that uses metallic powder, ceramic, or polymers to build
   simple/complex parts. The parts produced possess good strength, low
   weight, excellent mechanical properties and are cost-effective. This
   saves a considerable amount of both time and carrying cost. Thereof the
   challenges and opportunities that the space sector holds for AM is worth
   reviewing to provide a better insight into further developments and
   prospects for this technology. Design/methodology/approach The
   potentiality of 3D printing for the manufacturing of various components
   under space conditions has been explained. Here, the authors have
   reviewed the details of manufactured parts used for zero gravity
   missions, subjected to onboard International Space Station conditions
   and with those manufactured on earth. Followed by the major
   opportunities in 3D printing in space which include component repair,
   material characterization, process improvement and process development
   along with the new designs. The challenges such as space conditions,
   availability of power in space, the infrastructure requirements and the
   quality control or testing of the items that are being built in space
   are explained along with their possible mitigation strategies. Findings
   These components are well comparable with those prepared on earth which
   enables a massive cost saving. Other than the onboard manufacturing
   process, numerous other components and a complete robot/satellite for
   outer space applications were manufactured by AM. Moreover, these
   components can be recycled on board to produce feedstock for the next
   materials. The parts produced in space are bought back and compared with
   those built on earth. There is a difference in their nature i.e. the
   flight specimen showed a brittle nature and the ground specimen showed a
   denser nature. Originality/value The review discusses the advancements
   of 3D printing in space and provides numerous examples of the
   applications of 3D printing in space and space applications. The paper
   is solely dedicated to 3D printing in space. It provides a breakthrough
   in the literature as a limited amount of literature is available on this
   topic. The paper aims at highlighting all the challenges that AM faces
   in the space sector and also the future opportunities that await
   development.},

Abstract = {Complex parts can be successfully manufactured by means of Additive
   Manufacturing (AM) techniques based on thermoplastic polymer extrusion,
   whose use for mass production is restricted by their slow printing
   speed. To address this limitation, a flexible AM platform for big
   plastic objects has been realized mounting an industrial screw-based
   extruder on an anthropomorphic robot. An experimental campaign has been
   performed to set a suitable range of relevant process parameters, with
   the aim of ensuring a regular deposited layer geometry. Moreover, a
   closed-loop control strategy has been developed to correct the robot
   height based on data measured during the material deposition, thus
   further improving the process parameter setting and compensating the
   material shrinkage or other unexpected defects. Eventually, an online
   re-slicing algorithm has been implemented to preserve the desired height
   of the manufactured object, despite the layer height changes. The
   proposed approach allows a deposition flow rate up to 1250 cm(3)/h
   within a building volume limited only by the robot workspace.},

Title = {Photoinitiator Selection and Concentration in Photopolymer Formulations
   towards Large-Format Additive Manufacturing},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Photopolymers are an attractive option for large-format additive
   manufacturing (LFAM), because they can be formulated from structural
   thermosets and cure rapidly in ambient conditions under low-energy
   ultraviolet light-emitting diode (UV LED) lamps. Photopolymer cure is
   strongly influenced by the depth penetration of UV light, which can be
   limited in the 2-4 mm layer thicknesses typical of LFAM. Photoinitiator
   (PI) systems that exhibit photobleaching have proven useful in
   thick-section cure applications, because they generate a photoinitiation
   wavefront, but this effect is time-dependent. This study investigates
   the light transmission and through-thickness cure behavior in
   (meth)acrylate photopolymer formulations with the photobleaching
   initiator bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphine oxide (BAPO).
   Utilizing an optical model developed by Kenning et al., lower
   concentrations (0.1 wt\% to 0.5 wt\%) of BAPO were predicted to yield
   rapid onset of photoinitiation. In situ cure measurements under
   continuous UV LED irradiation of 380 mW/cm(2) showed that a 0.1 wt\%
   concentration of BAPO achieved peak polymerization rate within 2.5 s at
   a 3-mm depth. With only 1 s of irradiation at 1.7 W/cm(2) intensity, the
   0.1 wt\% BAPO formulation also achieved the highest level of cure of the
   formulas tested. For an irradiation dose of 5.5 J/cm(2) at a duration of
   3.7 s, cured polymer specimens achieved a flexural strength of 108 MPa
   and a flexural modulus of 3.1 GPa. This study demonstrates the utility
   of optical modeling as a potential screening tool for new photopolymer
   formulations, primarily in identifying an upper limit to PI
   concentration for the desired cure depth. The results also show that
   photobleaching provides only a limited benefit for LFAM applications
   with short (1.0 s to 3.7 s) UV irradiation times and indicate that
   excess PI concentration can inhibit light transmission even under
   extended irradiation times up to 60 s.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS IN HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER},
Year = {2021},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Compact heat exchangers are characterized by high heat transfer surface
   area per unit of volume, mainly used in applications where space and
   weight are restricted, present in the aerospace, automotive and naval
   sectors. The study of new technologies to produce compact heat
   exchangers has grown considerably in recent years. One of the
   technologies that presents a great potential for this application, and
   which has been little explored, is additive manufacturing. This work
   presents a feasibility analysis of additive manufacturing to produce
   polymer compact heat exchangers. Experimental tests in prototypes, using
   the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)
   technologies, were taken, aiming to evaluate the thermal and
   hydrodynamic behavior of the heat exchangers. They were tested with air
   at room temperature and water at high temperatures, over a wide Reynolds
   number range, from laminar to turbulent flow, comprising 150
   experimental tests. Additionally, a mathematical model to predict the
   thermal behavior of the prototype was developed and validated
   experimentally, the theoretical and experimental heat transfer rate
   showed good agreement, with an average error of approximately 3.5\%.
   Even with low thermal conductivity of the polymer, an overall heat
   transfer coefficient of 194 W/m(2)K was achieved.},

   tomography (CT) is used for a detailed analysis of the local material
   structure and resulting material porosity, thus the results can be put
   into context with process parameters. In addition, a highly curved test
   structure was fabricated that demonstrates the limits of the process and
   dependent fibre strand folding behaviours. These experimental
   investigations present the potential and the challenges of additive

Abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly
   achieved global pandemic status. The pandemic created huge demand for
   relevant medical and personal protective equipment (PPE) and put
   unprecedented pressure on the healthcare system within a very short span
   of time. Moreover, the supply chain system faced extreme disruption as a
   result of the frequent and severe lockdowns across the globe. In such a
   situation, additive manufacturing (AM) becomes a supplementary
   manufacturing process to meet the explosive demands and to ease the
   health disaster worldwide. Providing the extensive design customization,
   a rapid manufacturing route, eliminating lengthy assembly lines and
   ensuring low manufacturing lead times, the AM route could plug the
   immediate supply chain gap, whilst mass production routes restarted
   again. The AM community joined the fight against COVID-19 by producing
   components for medical equipment such as ventilators, nasopharyngeal
   swabs and PPE such as face masks and face shields. The aim of this
   article is to systematically summarize and to critically analyze all
   major efforts put forward by the AM industry, academics, researchers,
   users, and individuals. A step-by-step account is given summarizing all
   major additively manufactured products that were designed, invented,
   used, and produced during the pandemic in addition to highlighting some
   of the potential challenges. Such a review will become a historical
   document for the future as well as a stimulus for the next generation AM
   community.},

Abstract = {Functional surfaces have proven their potential to solve many
   engineering problems, attracting great interest among the scientific
   community. Bio-inspired multi-hierarchical microstructures grant the
   surfaces with new properties, such as hydrophobicity, adhesion, unique
   optical properties and so on. The geometry and fabrication of these
   surfaces are still under research. In this study, the feasibility of
   using direct fabrication of microscale features by additive
   manufacturing (AM) processes was investigated. The investigation was
   carried out using a specifically designed vat photopolymerization AM
   machine-tool suitable for precision manufacturing at the micro
   dimensional scale which has previously been developed, built and
   validated at the Technical University of Denmark. It was shown that it
   was possible to replicate a simplified surface inspired by the Tokay
   gecko, the geometry was previously designed and replicated by a complex
   multi-step micromanufacturing method extracted from the literature and
   used as benchmark. Ultimately, the smallest printed features were
   analyzed by conducting a sensitivity analysis to obtain the righteous
   parameters in terms of layer thickness and exposure time. Moreover, two
   more intricate designs were fabricated with the same parameters to
   assess the surfaces functionality by its wettability. The surface with
   increased density and decreased feature size showed a water contact
   angle (CA) of 124 degrees +/- 0.10 degrees, agreeing with the
   Cassie-Baxter model. These results indicate the possibility of using
   precision AM for a rapid, easy and reliable fabrication method for
   functional surfaces.},

Abstract = {The Robinson Research Institute at Victoria University Wellington is
   building a series of superconducting motors over the next six years to
   demonstrate technology pathways for the transport industry, including
   aviation. Our target topology for these machines uses rotor-mounted
   superconducting field coils and a superconducting stator in an air-core
   configuration. To avoid eddy current heating in the stator cryostat,
   electrically conductive materials must be eliminated. At the same time,
   heat generated due to AC losses in the stator must be transferred
   efficiently and evenly from the superconductor to the cryo-coolant, in
   order to avoid localised film boiling. And finally, the coil structural
   support needs to closely match the thermal expansion characteristics of
   the superconductor wires and likely other G10 structural pieces to avoid
   debilitating stresses and lost support.In this study, we investigated
   the opportunity to use additively manufactured (AM) polymers with a
   range of filler materials as the structural support for a motor coil. A
   range of commercially available candidate materials have been identified
   and test coupons manufactured using either Selective Laser Sintering
   (SLS) or Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM). The material properties of
   the test coupons have been measured from room temperature down to
   cryogenic temperatures. This data was used to design, analyse and
   manufacture the support structure for a stator saddle-coil, and the coil
   wound with aluminium wire to simulate Conductor on Round Core (CORC)
   cable. Initial thermal cycle testing has been carried out to assess the
   performance of the composite.},

Abstract = {This work explores the use of additive manufacturing (AM) to reprocess
   recycled glass and carbon fibers in the automotive sector. It aims to
   foster exploitation of recycled Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers (rGFRPs)
   and recycled Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (rCFRPs) through two
   manufacturing workflows: indirect Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) and
   UV-assisted Direct Ink Writing (UV-DIW). An industrial case study on
   vehicle components has been considered by prototyping one real
   component. After the tensile tests, some molds were fabricated with a
   FFF 3D printer for the indirect 3D printing process to cast an
   epoxy-based thermosetting resin with rGFs and rCFs. The second
   technology consisted in fabricating the parts by hardening in-situ a
   photo- and thermal-curable thermosetting acrylic liquid resin with rGFs.
   These results validate the use of AM and recycled composites for
   applications in the automotive sector. These approaches may be
   implemented for customizable components for batches below 100 vehicles
   as the first step for their exploitation.},

Title = {Printability of elastomer latex for additive manufacturing or 3D
   printing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {133},
Number = {4},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing, sometimes referred to as 3D printing is a new,
   rapidly developing technology which has the potential to revolutionize
   fabrication of certain high value, complex products. Until now
   conventional elastomers have not been widely used in the additive
   manufacturing process. The goal of our work was to determine the
   feasibility of additive manufacturing using ink jet printing of
   elastomeric latex materials. Particle size, viscosity, and surface
   tension were measured for five different latex
   materials-poly(2-chloro-1,3-butadiene), carboxylated styrene-butadiene
   rubber, carboxylated butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer, natural rubber,
   and prevulcanized natural rubber. The XSBR latex was predicted as the
   one most likely to be printable. Printing trials carried out with the
   XSBR as the ink proved it to be printable, although technical problems
   of agglomeration and print head clogging need to be addressed and both
   the material and process need to be optimized for consistent printing to
   be achieved. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Abstract = {Affordable commercial desktop 3-D printers and filaments have introduced
   additive manufacturing to all disciplines of science and engineering.
   With rapid innovations in 3-D printing technology and new filament
   materials, material vendors are offering specialty multifunctional
   metal-reinforced polymers with unique properties. Studies are necessary
   to understand the effects of filament composition, metal reinforcements,
   and print parameters on microstructure and mechanical behavior. In this
   study, densities, metal vol\%, metal cross-sectional area \%, and
   microstructure of various metal-reinforced Polylactic Acid (PLA)
   filaments were characterized by multiple methods. Comparisons are made
   between polymer microstructures before and after printing, and the
   effect of printing on the metal-polymer interface adhesion has been
   demonstrated. Tensile response and fracture toughness as a function of
   metal vol\% and print height was determined. Tensile and fracture
   toughness tests show that PLA filaments containing approximately 36
   vol\% of bronze or copper particles significantly reduce mechanical
   properties. The mechanical response of PLA with 12 and 18 vol\% of
   magnetic iron and stainless steel particles, respectively, is similar to
   that of pure PLA with a slight decrease in ultimate tensile strength and
   fracture toughness. These results show the potential for tailoring the
   concentration of metal reinforcements to provide multi-functionality
   without sacrificing mechanical properties.</p>},

Abstract = {As a 0D material, powder particles can be used to create almost any
   complicated engineering component by utilizing the high-performance
   manufacturing capabilities of additive manufacturing (AM). Although
   powder-based AM methods provide an outstanding practical value and
   development for modern manufacturing world, they continue to face
   challenges such as a lack of accessible categories, temperature
   restrictions, and poor performance of molded components. Therefore,
   researching for new AM materials and procedures has become an extremely
   necessary endeavor. For this purpose, a firm grasp of the current state
   of the art of powder-based AM technologies is imperative. Hence, herein,
   a comprehensive review is presented on the most widely used powder-based
   AM methods, and the materials used by these methods. For each method,
   the development and current state, operating principles, limitations,
   and future prospects are summarized. In contrast, for materials, their
   classifications, properties, and preparation methods are explored in
   great detail, while also commenting on the specific compatibilities
   between powder materials and powder methods. Industrial and
   commercialized applications of powder-based AM are also presented in
   this work. Finally, the limitations of the current powder-based
   technologies are highlighted, with comments regarding the future of this
   field.},

Abstract = {Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is one of the most popularly used
   additive manufacturing techniques to manufacture complex geometry
   thermoplastic polymer parts. In FDM, during solidification process, the
   extruded filament called as roads gets bonded with the adjacent roads
   forming a layer and hence the entire part. Time-dependent thermal
   behavior of the polymer material decides the structural integrity of the
   part that is manufactured. An attempt has been made to analyze the
   effect of temperature on bond formation. A new mathematical model is
   developed to relate time, temperature and the extent of bonding. Parts
   are manufactured at different extrusion temperatures, and tensile tests
   are conducted to evaluate the strength and its dependency on extrusion
   temperature. Fractured specimens are observed under scanning electron
   microscope to understand the bonding between the fused polymer roads.
   Results show good agreement between the proposed mathematical model and
   the experiment results.},

Abstract = {Additive Manufacturing aka 3D printing opens up a whole new era for
   digital design and manufacturing. No longer is the aerospace engineering
   designer constrained by the ability to manufacture a component. The new
   philosophy is ``if you can design it, we can produce it{''}. Yet there
   is a laundry list of caveats with the current state of the technology
   especially as it applies to aerospace applications and in particular,
   launch vehicles. Use of polymer based materials has caught hold in
   production tooling, yet use of polymers and metals for actual flight
   applications faces challenges until the technology catches up with the
   specific needs of the Aerospace industry. Launch vehicle applications
   may prove to be the bounding arena for aerospace applications. Consider
   the need for perfection in quality, temperature extremes from cryogenic
   commodities to rocket engine exhaust, shock and vibration conditions,
   and the grand size. However, given the variety of exquisite designs and
   low volume, aerospace applications are well suited for Additive
   Manufacturing. The challenges of today are already being solved and
   incorporated into the technology of tomorrow. It is simply a matter of
   time before AM finds not only a foot hold in aerospace but becomes the
   manufacturing tool of choice.},

Journal = {MATERIALS \& DESIGN},

Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing is enabling a paradigm shift in design and
   production, but conventional techniques reach their limits when metallic
   structures require walls with <0.5 mm thickness. Here we introduce an
   approach for indirect additive manufacturing of thin-walled alloy
   structures. First a polymer template is additively manufactured, then
   metal layers are deposited by electroplating, physical or chemical vapor
   deposition. After removal of the polymer, the metal layers can be
   interdiffused to form an alloy via homogenization heat treatments. Three
   different alloys designed for three elevated temperature regimes are
   demonstrated: Monel alloys based on Ni-Cu-Al-Ti, nickel superalloys
   based on Ni-Cr-Al and refractory rhenium alloys based on Re-Co. A
   process was developed to co-deposit rhenium and cobalt via aqueous
   electroplating, resulting in an alloy with a melting point of 2000
   degrees C and a Vickers hardness of 480 +/- 50 HV0.2 after
   homogenization. Two applications of interest for the aerospace industry
   were chosen to demonstrate the technology. High temperature truss core
   sandwich structures and rocket engine thruster demos where fabricated.

Title = {Economic assessment for additive manufacturing of automotive end-use
   parts through digital light processing (DLP)},
Journal = {CIRP JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Within the last years, digital light processing (DLP) became a viable
   solution for the manufacturing of end-use parts in various industries
   among other additive manufacturing (AM) processes. As the number of
   applications realized in a rapid manufacturing (RM) approach grows, it
   is necessary to understand the process economics better when moving from
   laboratory and prototyping applications into the costsensitive
   production scale. This paper presents a production-centered economic
   assessment of DLP production in the early product development process,
   based on Continuous Liquid Interphase Printing (CLIP). It is applied to
   an automotive exterior part case study to reveal expected process
   economics and estimate part prime cost for different printer sizes and
   automation concepts. A subsequent sensitivity analysis assesses the
   influence of relevant cost drivers and identifies opportunities for
   further cost savings when producing end-use parts with DLP. Results may
   help machine OEMs and application developers in cost optimization and
   decision making in RM. (C) 2021 CIRP.},

Abstract = {Additive manufacturing constitutes a promising production technology
   with potential application in a broad range of industrial areas. In this
   type of manufacturing process, objects are created from powder particles
   by adding layers of material upon one another through selectively
   melting particles from the powder bed. However, understanding the
   mechanical behavior of the powder during manufacturing as a function of
   material properties and particle shape is an essential pre-requisite for
   optimizing the production process. Here we develop a numerical tool for
   modeling the dynamics of powder particles during additive manufacturing
   based on force-based simulations by means of the Discrete Element Method
   (DEM). An existing DEM software (LIGGGHTS) is extended in order to study
   the transport of powder particles of complex geometric shapes through
   accounting for the boundary conditions inherent to the manufacturing

Abstract = {The implementation of additive manufacturing for ceramics is more
   challenging than for other material classes, since most of the shaping
   methods require polymer binder. Laser additive manufacturing (LAM) could
   offer a new binder-free consolidation route, since it is capable of
   processing ceramics in a direct manner without post processing. However,
   laser processing of ceramics, especially high performance oxide
   ceramics, is limited by low thermal shock resistance, weak densification
   and low light absorptance at room temperature; particularly in the
   visible or near-infrared range. An extensive review focusing only on LAM
   (powder bed fusion - laser beam and directed energy deposition) of high
   performance oxide ceramics is currently lacking. This state-of-the-art
   review gives a detailed summary and critical analysis about process
   technologies, part properties, open challenges and process monitoring in
   the field of oxide ceramics. Improvements in accuracy and mechanical
   strength are proposed that could open LAM of oxide ceramics to new
   fields.},

Title = {Non-destructive evaluation of additively manufactured polymer objects

Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {364-372},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {X-ray interferometry provides a dark-field image, essentially a
   small-angle X-ray scattering image, of the voids and print defects in an
   additively manufactured polymer object. The interferometers used were
   tuned to scattering length 2-5 mu m and configured to measure scattering
   along both vertical and horizontal directions. The samples studied
   included Stanford Bunnies, fabricated from acrylonitrile butadiene
   styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA), and a quadratic test object
   fabricated from PLA. The dark-field projection images show orientation
   dependent X-ray scattering which is due to anisotropic voids and gaps at
   the filament-to-filament interface in these fused deposition modeling
   additive manufacturing objects. SEM corroborates the existence of gaps
   between filaments.
   The absorption and dark-field volumes are used to correlate printhead
   trajectory with print defect density. The absorption volume is used to
   generate perimeter points slice-by-slice, and from these points, the 2D
   curvature is calculated. There is a slight increase in X-ray scattering,
   hence print defect density, at regions with high curvature.
   Two X-ray interferometry techniques were used: stepped-grating and
   single-shot. As currently developed, stepped-grating has the larger
   field-of-view examination of an entire test object whilst single-shot
   has the potential for real-time, in situ measurement of the printing
   process within 1 mm of the printhead.},

Title = {Do hydrothermal aging and microwave sterilization affect the trueness of
   milled, additive manufactured and injection molded denture bases?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {111},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Concepts for digital denture manufacturing are market-available but
   studies comparing the trueness of such dentures, either milled (MIL) or
   additive manufactured, compared to injection molded (IM) ones are still
   limited. Regarding the impact of artificial aging and microwave
   sterilization on this parameter, no data are available. Therefore, the
   purpose of this investigation was to assess the trueness of IM, MIL, and
   stereolithography (SLA) printed denture bases after manufacturing,
   hydrothermal cycling, and microwave sterilization. Sixteen edentulous
   maxillary plaster models were poured using a silicone mold and digitized
   by means of a desktop scanner. For group IM, 16 denture bases were
   injection molded using these models. For group MIL and SLA, the denture
   bases were virtually designed and manufactured referring to the
   digitized data. A total of 48 samples were scanned 1) after
   manufacturing, 2) after hydrothermal cycling (5-55 degrees C, N =
   5,000), and after 3) three as well as 4) six cycles of microwave
   sterilization for 6 min each at 640 W. The 3D surface deviation of the
   total intaglio surface, the palate, the alveolar ridge, and the border
   seal region was evaluated on the basis of the root mean square
   estimation (RMSE) and positive and negative mean deviations with an
   inspection software. For statistical analysis, ANOVA and post hoc Tukey
   tests were performed (alpha = 0.05). MIL showed the lowest deviations of
   the total RMSE (P <= .006) compared with the scans of the plaster
   models. In comparison, IM showed increased, mainly positive, deviations
   (P = .006) at the border seal. SLA presented the highest total RMSE (P =
   .001) with increased negative deviations, likewise at the border seal.
   In contrast to SLA (P = .001), no differences between IM and MIL (P =
   .816) were measured after hydrothermal cycling. Following microwave
   sterilization, the trueness of SLA was higher compared to IM and MIL (P
   = .001), with no differences between MIL and IM (P = .153). Distortion
   of IM and MIL was measured after the 3rd cycle with no further changes
   observed thereafter (P >= .385). It can be concluded, that subtractive
   manufacturing of denture bases results in the highest trueness, followed
   by IM and SLA. In contrast to IM and SLA, hydrothermal cycling did not
   affect MIL. Solely SLA printed denture bases remained dimensionally
   stable after microwave sterilization.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the use of additive manufacturing (AM) has been
   demonstrated in the fabrication of components in polymer electrolyte
   membrane fuel cell, solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), microbial fuel cell
   (MFC) and laminar flow-based fuel cell (LFFC). Various AM technologies
   have been successfully demonstrated in fuel cell manufacturing include
   material extrusion, powder bed fusion, vat photopolymerization and
   binder jetting. One of the unique advantages of AM is the ability to
   handle sophisticated design with features ranging from macro to micro
   scales, which are inaccessible by conventional manufacturing
   technologies. Well-designed complex 3D structures were reported to have
   the potential for increasing the performance of fuel cells. Therefore,
   AM presents itself as a promising fabrication method to promote the
   development of fuel cells. Besides, AM also showed its specialty in
   time-saving, flexibility, and on-demand manufacturability in the
   fabrication of fuel cell components. In spite of the prospects of AM in
   fuel cells, more studies and researches are required to overcome
   challenges, such as availability of material, manufacturing quality, and
   the costs. This review focuses on the advantages and applications of
   additive manufacturing that enable improvement in fuel cell performance.
   The critical challenges and directions for future development are also
   highlighted.},

Title = {Functional, thermal and rheological properties of polymer-based magnetic
   composite filaments for additive manufacturing},
Journal = {MATERIALS \& DESIGN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {219},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The design of functional composite filaments for fused filament
   fabrication requires a suitable polymer composition, functionality of
   particles, uniform distribution of fillers throughout the filament, and
   adequate printability. Uniform distribution at predictable
   concentrations is achieved by designing polymeric capsules containing
   the fillers and using them as feedstock for extrusion. Functionality can
   be inferred from that of the particles and target concentration.
   However, suitable conditions for printing strongly depend on polymer
   type and characteristics/concentration of fillers. Soft magnetic
   composite filaments were produced from polylactic acid (PLA) capsules
   filled with 30-52 wt. \% maraging steel particles. Composite filaments
   preserve the soft magnetic character of the fillers. Fillers reduce the
   transition temperatures of the polymer by ti 5 K and have a profound
   impact on printability. Rheological characterization shows that the
   ``ball bearing effect{''} of gas-atomized particles reduces the
   viscosity of the composites by more than one order of magnitude,
   decreasing printing temperature from 215 degrees C to 170 degrees C,
   associated with the lack of agglomeration of particles achieved by the
   proposed production method. Rheological experiments allow to detect the
   required changes in printing conditions without requiring an extensive
   and costly trial and error process of printing with a large set of
   printing parameters. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Continuously Reinforced Polymeric Composite for Additive
   Manufacturing-Development and Efficiency Analysis},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a rapidly growing technology, referring
   to a 3D design process by which digital data builds a physical object in
   layers by depositing the printed material. The AM has evolved in the
   aviation, automotive, and medical industries. The AM development for
   fiber-reinforced composites is the point of current interest, with most
   research focused on using short fibers. However, notwithstanding
   particular technological complexities, continuous filaments have
   superior tensile properties compared to short fibers. Therefore, this
   manuscript develops an adaptive continuous reinforcement approach for AM
   based on polymeric material extrusion (ME) technology. It combines the
   raw material production process, including the ability to vary
   constituents (e.g., filament materials, reinforcement percentage, and
   recycled plastic replacement ratio), and the reinforcement efficiency
   analysis regarding the experimentally verified numerical model. The
   literature review has identified compatible materials for ensuring
   sustainable and high-performance plastic composites reinforced with
   continuous fibers. In addition, it identified the applicability of
   recycled polymers in developing ME processes. Thus, the study includes
   an experimental program to investigate the mechanical performance of 3D
   printed samples (polylactic acid, PLA, matrix reinforced with continuous
   aramid filament) through a tensile test. Recycled polymer replaced 40\%
   of the virgin PLA. The test results do not demonstrate the recycled
   polymer's negative effect on the mechanical performance of the printed
   samples. Moreover, the recycled material reduced the PLA cost by almost
   twice. However, together with the potential efficiency of the developed
   adaptive manufacturing technology, the mechanical characteristics of the
   printed material revealed room for printing technology improvement,
   including the aligned reinforcement distribution in the printed product
   and printing parameters' setup.},

Title = {Additive manufactured thermoplastic elastomers for low-stress driven
   elastocaloric cooling},
Journal = {APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {30},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Exploiting the strain-induced crystallization of soft elastomeric
   polymers elastocaloric cooling has recently been explored as an
   environmental-friendly alternative to conventional refrigeration.
   Elastomers require a much lower applied stress to induce the
   elastocaloric effect compared to shape memory alloys. Several prototype
   coolers employing these soft polymers have been demonstrated to achieve
   a moderate temperature span under lower stresses. Here, we investigate
   the elastocaloric properties and potential cooling performance of five
   thermoplastic elastomers that can be 3D printed, both in the form of
   filaments and as Additive Manufactured (AM) parts. The materials were
   first characterized as filaments to screen for the elastomers with the
   highest elastocaloric effects. A large adiabatic temperature change of
   17.8 K was obtained in the Ultimaker98A filament. AM parameters were
   optimized to achieve parts with satisfactory functional stability while
   maintaining their elastocaloric effect. As a printed part, NinjaFlex
   achieved a high material coefficient of performance (COPmat) of 3.2 with
   1.74 J/g input work at similar to 0.1 Hz, driven by a stress of 5.7 MPa.
   Implementing AM elastocaloric elastomers creates opportunities for the
   development of full-scale low-activation-stress regenerative
   elastocaloric cooling components that enable optimizing flow structures
   and enhanced heat-transfer performance.},

   advantages and disadvantages. Consequently, a review of the different
   additive-manufacturing technologies used to fabricate cellular and
   lattice materials is presented here, summarizing the applicability and
   limitations of each technique. The techniques are categorized according
   to the state of the raw material they use filament, fluid, and powder.
   Additionally, guidance on the use of each is given to benefit the
   fabrication of structured materials.},

   structure-property relationship study of UV-curing polyesters from
   itaconic acid},
Journal = {EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {186},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {A series of bio-based polyester derived from itaconic acid was
   synthesized as alternative binder resin to polyester acrylates in
   UV-curing additive manufacturing processes. Different diols and
   dicarboxylic acids from both petrochemical and renewable resources were
   combined to create polyester structures that have not been previously
   described. Employing these monomers allowed for the synthesis of novel
   polyester resins with a biobased content from 56 to 100\%. The influence
   of the different chemical structures (double bond density, flexibility,
   aromatic content, etc.) of these itaconic acid-based materials on the
   physicochemical properties was thoroughly investigated for the first
   time. Subsequently, formulations derived from these polyesters were
   prepared and processed on a digital light processing (DLP)-machine to
   obtain test specimen. Mechanical and thermal characterization of cured
   parts revealed a dependency of the properties on both choice of monomers
   and crosslink density. Cyclic structures in the polyester resin resulted
   in very rigid materials with glass transition temperatures up to 97
   degrees C and tensile modulus of 2400 MPa. The incorporation of longer
   aliphatic chains on the other hand gave rise to flexible materials with
   an elongation at break up to 50\%. Hence, the materials described herein
   allow for additive manufacturing materials with tunable properties and
   an overall bio-based content up to 85\%.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this research is unsatisfactory state of knowledge of the

   material and reinforcing material in the form of short and focused
   carbon fibers that can be used in additive manufacturing technologies.
   The paper presents a conceptual design of an extrusion head used in
   Fused Deposition Technology, which allows for the implementation of
   appropriately stacked fibers at the level of detail production. Finite
   element simulation was performed to simulate the thermal effect of the
   system to demonstrate the effect of head cooling on the system. The
   assumed extrusion temperature of the material was obtained at a uniform
   nozzle temperature and stable temperature of the entire system. Flow
   simulation of thermoplastic polymer was carried out in the designed
   extrusion nozzle. By supplying 0.5 mm wire of 1.75 mm diameter
   thermoplastic material to the nozzle, the extrusion rate was 0.192 m/s.
   The proper design of the extrusion head for the intended applications
   has been demonstrated and the purpose of further research in this field

Abstract = {We show that a polymer-based route to ceramics can be implemented into

   nanometer scale coatings of the ceramic, in this way, is employed to
   create defect-free infiltrations of carbon fiber composites. The
   mechanical strength of the fibers is retained in the composite.
   Excellent wetting properties of the polymer precursor permits
   three-dimensional, conformal coating through the three stages of
   infiltration: nanoscale coating of the single fibers, filling of
   interstitial spaces between the fibers, and a buildup of the coating
   over the entire composite. The flash pyrolysis method will enable a new
   genre of polymer-derived ceramics made into net shape by this unusual
   method of additive manufacturing.},

Journal = {3D PRINTING AND ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 DEC 20},
Abstract = {The global trend in additive manufacturing is the technology of
   three-dimensional (3D) printing with a high potential to avoid some of
   the weaknesses of conventional fabrication techniques. This new
   technology has been used to manufacture small tidal and wind turbines.
   In isolated areas, small turbines can be manufactured and assembled
   on-site for green energy production. The purpose of this document is to
   evaluate the thermomechanical behavior of a printed tidal turbine using
   Digimat-AM (Additive Manufacturing) with fused filament fabrication
   method. The finite element computes the mechanical deflection,
   temperature, residual stresses, and warpage fields of the printed part.
   The composites used during printing are thermoplastic polymers
   (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polyamide 6 {[}PA6], polyamide 12
   {[}PA12], and polyetherimide {[}PEI]) reinforced with carbon and glass
   fillers in the form of fibers and beads (CF/GF and CB/GB). Through the
   simulation, one could show that the blade printed with PEI-CB/CF has
   excellent mechanical performance of low mechanical deflection and
   warpage, compared to PA6-CB/CF. In addition, the fiber-shaped fillers
   are better than the bead-shaped ones for the 3D printing process. In
   general, this study has shown the potential and feasibility of 3D
   printing as an excellent opportunity in the fabrication of small blades
   in the future, but more studies are required to understand this
   potential.},

   a binder precursor},
Journal = {MATERIALS \& DESIGN},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {147},
Pages = {146-156},
Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {Metal-Organic-Decomposition (MOD) ink is a particle-free metal ink that
   can precipitate metal nanoparticles upon heating. This ink-jettable
   metal nanoparticle ink can be used as a binder precursor to replace
   commonly used polymer adhesives in the Additive Manufacturing of metals
   components using binder jetting technology. After being deposited into
   the powder bed interstices and exposed to a heat, the jetted ink
   decomposes and form metal nanoparticles that are then fused by sintering
   to provide bonding strength to the printed parts. Regions of the powder
   bed that do not receive the jetted nanoparticles remain as loose powder,
   as the heat supplied to sinter nanoparticles is maintained below the
   initial sintering temperature of larger powder bed particles. The proof
   of concept is demonstrated in the context of printing copper by jetting
   copper MOD ink as a precursor to the binder, with the capability of
   producing satisfactory geometries when using sufficiently high binder
   saturation ratio. After sintering, the MOD ink printed parts produce a
   denser core section but more porous shell in the sintered parts,
   compared to the polymer binder printed counterparts. (C) 2018 Published

Abstract = {3D Printing additive manufacturing is a rapidly developing form of
   technology. Currently able to manipulate many polymers (both synthetic
   and organic), this technique is quickly becoming an integral part of
   biotechnological developments. This paper highlights the fundamentals of
   this technology namely the mechanisms employed in standard 3D printing,
   it then introduces tissue engineering a field in which current versions
   of this technology have been employed as bioprinting. The limitations
   with respect to tissue engineering are discussed outlining the current
   technologies inability to produce nanofibre based structures common in
   tissue such as tendon, cartilage and cornea. From this requirement for
   nanofibre production, electrospinning is introduced as a potential
   pathway for future tissue engineering 3D printing technologies and
   finally the current combination of this technology with 3D Printing is
   discussed yielding current limitations in retaining required
   nanoresolutions.},

Title = {Upper bound of feed rates in thermoplastic material extrusion additive
   manufacturing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In this work, we develop a simple model to determine the upper bound of
   feed rates that do not cause jamming in material extrusion additive
   manufacturing, also known as fused deposition modeling (FDM)(TM) or
   fused-filament fabrication (FFF). We first derive a relation between the
   tube temperature and Peclet number for the solid portion of polymer
   filaments. We focus on the boundary between the solid and molten polymer
   in the heated portion of the tube. We find the Peclet number that

Title = {A study on additive manufacturing build parameters as bonded joint
   design factors},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADHESION},
Year = {2021},
Month = {2021 JAN 18},
Abstract = {This work explores the influence of Additive Manufacturing (AM)
   parameters on the Mode I fracture toughness of polymer bonded joints.
   The motivation is that realizing AM parts to be later assembled can be
   convenient from the manufacturing standpoint and adhesive bonding avoids
   distortion and material modification due to heat while welding or the
   use of fasteners. PLA and ABS joints were tested and three different
   printing parameters (extruder temperature, printing speed and layer
   thickness) were selected to evaluate their influence on roughness,
   wettability and tensile behaviour of the adherends. A full-factorial
   Design of Experiment was chosen to study roughness and wettability
   because of the short sample manufacturing and measurement time, while a
   Taguchi L9 orthogonal array was selected for the tensile testsr to save
   manufacturing and testing time. The significance and the mutual
   interactions of printing parameters were identified by analysis of
   variance. Combinations yielding maximum and minimum values of the
   output, respectively, were used to produce adherends for Double
   Cantilever Beam (DCB) joints and evaluate the effect on Mode I fracture
   toughness, demonstrating that process parameters do have an effect on
   fracture toughness and that an optimum value can be found by simply
   operating on the AM setup.},

   overview},
Journal = {RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {24},
Number = {7},
Pages = {1166-1177},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to overview the literature about
   the environmental performance of additive manufacturing (AM) and to
   evaluate the use of life cycle assessment (LCA) on these studies.
   Design/methodology/approach This study was based on the systematic
   literature review.
   Findings The investigation found that most authors were concerned about
   the energy consumption of the AM equipment, which is the subject studied
   by 87\% of articles. In addition, 25\% of the studies used LCA at least
   in some level, making a global environment assessment to evaluate the
   environmental impacts of AM. By analyzing research studies, it was
   possible to find signs that AM could be a lower environmental impact
   process, when compared with traditional manufacturing. However, this
   assumption is not valid in all cases because there are many variables
   that may affect environmental results.
   Originality/value Due to the increase on the usage of this type of
   technology by industries, studies on the environmental performance of
   this process became relevant.},

Title = {Study on sintering mechanism for extrusion-based additive manufacturing
   of stainless steel through molecular dynamics simulation},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Unlike conventional metal powder based additive manufacturing (AM)
   technology, a Printing-Debinding-Sintering (PDS) process that adopts
   polymer-based filaments with highly filled metal particles can be
   employed as an economical approach to create metal parts at high
   fabrication rate and a low manufacturing cost. To achieve dense metal
   parts, the underlying sintering mechanism should be well understood,
   which has not yet been documented. In this study, molecular dynamics
   (MD) simulation was conducted to comprehensively unveil the sintering
   mechanisms during PDS of stainless steel 316L using a novel Fe-Ni-Cr
   three-element, three-particle sintering configuration. The mechanism of
   Cr element aggregation at the grain boundaries was revealed by analyzing
   the evolution of particle structure, diffusion activation energy, and
   interactions among solute elements during the unique heating process of
   PDS. In addition, the microstructure of the PDS-built 316L samples was
   characterized to verify such an aggregation phenomenon. It was found
   that the self-diffusion coefficient of Cr element increased
   substantially at the 1600 K holding stage. Meanwhile, Cr element was
   diffused to grain boundary and formed severe grain boundary aggregation
   due to its lower diffusion activation energy and stronger interactions
   between atoms. Moreover, the extra energy released due to this
   aggregation phenomenon promoted a further coalescence of particles. This
   study provides an atomic-scale understanding of sintering behavior of
   PDS-built Fe-based alloys, which paves a way for the multiscale modeling
   of the sintering process in PDS of other alloy systems.},

Abstract = {The significance of 3D printing has risen exponentially in biomedical
   and pharmaceutical applications. Its potential in the field of
   fabricating drug delivery systems, by virtue of processing biocompatible
   polymers, has been very lucrative. This work aims to tap the
   interstitial drug delivery kinetics that are often inaccessible through
   machine-specific infill patterns in additive manufactured tablets
   fabricated using PVA biopolymer as an excipient. In this regard, a
   myo-inositol containing tablet has been printed using Fused Deposition
   Modeling preceded by Hot Melt Extrusion drug loading route. Two
   machine-specific infill patterns were taken, namely straight and grid.
   Later, these two distinct patterns were juxtaposed to obtain novel
   hybrid infill patterns in the tablets. Then, these tablets and their
   filament were subjected to various thermal, mechanical, imaging and
   pharmaceutical characterization tests to assess the feasibility of the
   research attempt. Finally, dissolution tests were conducted to evaluate
   their dissolution behavior over a time period. The characterization
   tests proved the scientific viability of this attempt along with
   amorphous existence of drug in the polymeric filament. The dissolution
   results showed favorable drug release by achieving interstitial
   dissolution timings with surface area/volume (SA/V) ratio being found to
   be the principal factor.},

   Manufacturing Process},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING AND MATERIALS PROCESSING},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {One of the most essential components of the fused deposition modeling
   (FDM) additive manufacturing (AM) process is the build plate, the
   surface upon which the part is constructed. These are typically made
   from aluminum or glass, but there are clear disadvantages to both and
   restrictions on which materials can be processed on them successfully.
   This study examined the suitability of heated aluminum-polycarbonate
   (AL-PC) composite print beds for FDM, looking particularly at the
   mechanical properties, thermal behavior, deformation behavior, bonding
   strength with deposited material, printing quality, and range of
   material usability. Theoretical examination and physical experiments
   were performed for each of these areas; the results were compared to
   similar experiments done using heated aluminum and aluminum-glass print
   beds. Ten distinct materials (ABS, PLA, PET, HIPS, PC, TPU, PVA, nylon,
   metal PLA, and carbon-fiber PLA) were tested for printing performance.
   The use of a heated AL-PC print bed was found to be a practical option
   for most of the materials, particularly ABS and TPU, which are often
   challenging to process using traditional print bed types. Generally, the
   results were found to be equivalent to or superior to tempered glass and
   superior to standard aluminum build plates in terms of printing
   capability.},

Abstract = {Powder bed-based additive manufacturing has become increasingly
   important for industrial applications. In the light of this, qualitative
   considerations such as the geometrical accuracy, the resulting
   mechanical properties, and the surface quality of additively
   manufactured parts must be taken into account. Optical measuring
   techniques such as confocal laser scanning microscopy, fringe projection
   and focus variation as well as profilometers are evaluated here, to
   determine the surface quality of powder bed-based manufactured parts.
   Even though these surface evaluation methods are established
   commercially, no standardized measuring procedure has yet been
   established. Within an experimental study the validity and accuracy of
   surface measurement methods are evaluated below, taking the limitations
   of each measurement system and the comparability of areal surface
   textures into account. The examinations are carried out with the powder
   materials EN-AW2024, Ti-6V-4Al and PA12, which are processed by electron
   beam melting, and laser beam melting of metals and polymers. Guidance
   for a consistent and comparable surface evaluation is thereby provided.},

Abstract = {Beer bagasse is a residue waste produced in great amounts; nevertheless,
   it is still underestimated in the industry. The aim of this paper is to
   develop an innovative and efficient methodology to recycle the beer
   bagasse by producing Poly-lactic acid(PLA)-based bio-composites, in the
   forms of pellets and filaments, to be used in additive manufacturing
   processes. To assess the suitability of beer bagasse for extrusion-based
   3D printing techniques, it was, firstly, physically and chemically
   characterized. Then, it was added in combination with different kinds of
   plasticizers to PLA to make bio-composites, analyzing their thermal and
   physical properties. The results prove the great potential of bagasse,
   evidencing its printability. Both composites' pellets and filaments were
   used in two different 3D printing machines and the mechanical properties
   of the 3D-printed models were evaluated as a function of the composition
   and the kind of technology used. All the used plasticizers improved
   processability and the polymer-bagasse interface. Compared to neat PLA,
   no changes in thermal properties were detected, but a lowering of the
   mechanical properties of the 3D-printed composites compared to the neat
   polymers was observed. Finally, a comparison between the efficiency of
   the two 3D printing techniques to be used with the bio-based composites
   was performed.},

Title = {Production and characterization of PEEK/IF-WS<sub>2</sub> nanocomposites
   for additive manufacturing: Simultaneous improvement in processing
   characteristics and material properties},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {31},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Successful printing of high-performance material with suitable
   properties using additive manufacturing methods such as Fused Filament
   Fabrication (FFF) can create many advanced applications in industries.
   However, the high viscosity of high-performance polymers causes
   complications during the FFF process and reduces the final print
   quality. To overcome this challenge, Inorganic Fullerene Tungsten
   Sulphide (IF-WS2) nanoparticles are applied in this study to enhance the
   flowability of poly-ether-ketone-ketone (PEEK) without compromising its
   mechanical and thermal properties. In the first step, different loadings
   of IF-WS2 nanoparticles are melt compounded with PEEK and the
   nanocomposites are characterized. SEM and EDX images of fractured
   surfaces indicate that a good dispersion of nanoparticles is achieved
   without any pre-treatment or pre-dispersion. A reduction in melt
   viscosity of 25\%, and a simultaneous growth in storage modulus,
   crystallization and degradation temperature of about 60\%, 53\% and 100
   degrees C is found with addition of 2 wt\% IF-WS2 to PEEK, respectively.
   This great achievement is mainly ascribed to the unique characteristics
   of IF-WS2 nanoparticles, acting as both reinforcing and lubricating
   agents, indicated by a reduction in coefficient of friction. There is no
   significant increase of crystallization and melting temperatures with
   the addition of IF-WS2 nanoparticles, which is beneficial in the FFF
   process. In the second step, the PEEK nanocomposite filaments are
   printed via FFF. The print quality and mechanical properties of the
   printed PEEK are also improved with the incorporation of IF-WS2
   nanoparticles. Hence, incorporation of IF-WS2 nanoparticles into PEEK
   via melt compounding is an effective approach for the development of
   suitable high-performance engineering materials for FFF.},

Abstract = {In recent years, with the recent advancements in the field of additive
   manufacturing, the use of biobased thermoplastic polymers and their
   natural fiber-reinforced biocomposite filaments have been rapidly
   emerging. Compared to their oil-based counterparts, they provide several
   advantages with their low carbon footprints, ease of reusability and
   recyclability and abundancy, and comparable price ranges. In
   consideration of their increasing usage, the present study focused on
   the development and analysis of biocomposite material blends and
   filaments by merging state-of-the-art manufacturing and material
   technologies. A thorough suitability study for fused deposition modeling
   (FDM), which is used to manufacture samples by depositing the melt
   layer-by-layer, was carried out. The mechanical, thermal, and
   microstructural characterization of birch fiber reinforced PLA composite
   granules, in-house extruded filaments, and printed specimens were
   investigated. The results demonstrated the printability of biocomposite
   filaments. However, it was also concluded that the parameters still need
   to be optimized for generic and flawless filament extrusion and printing
   processes. Thus, minimal labor and end-products with better strength and
   resolutions can be achieved.},

Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Fused filament fabrication, commonly referred to as 3D printing, is an
   additive manufacturing method finding plenty of applications nowadays.
   In contrast, polymer nanopatterning by nanolithographic techniques plays
   an important role in obtaining functional surfaces and coatings for
   applications in different fields including micro- and nanoelectronics.
   In spite of their relevance, additive manufacturing and polymer
   nanolithography have not found yet a common niche to be developed.
   Although both approaches are oriented to achieve different types of
   objects, it is shown that the confluence of both technologies can be
   desirable and potentially convenient. Herein, it is demonstrated that by
   employing conventional 3D printing, it is possible to fabricate
   nanostructured polymer surfaces in a relatively simple way by using
   similar approaches as those used in nanoimprint lithography but without
   the need for clean room conditions. To do that, a printed-assisted
   nanoimprint lithography concept (3DPrANIL) has been tested for different
   types of polymer and silicon templates. It is demonstrated that a
   polymeric nanostructured hydrophilic template can be replicated
   accurately on another polymer rendering a nanostructured surface with
   enhanced hydrophobicity. The results support 3DPrANIL as novel method to
   obtain micro- and nanostructured surfaces with different functionalities
   like iridescence and hydrophobicity.},

Title = {Additive manufacturing of high-performance vinyl ester resin via direct
   ink writing with UV-thermal dual curing},
Journal = {ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {46},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Vinyl ester (VE) resin is widely used as a thermosetting polymer for
   structural materials because of its high mechanical properties and
   excellent chemical resistance. Using additive manufacturing to produce
   highperformance VE structures with dimensional scalability and material
   efficiency has gained interest from both research and industry, however
   it is challenging due to the limitations of current techniques. In this
   work, a modified setup of direct ink writing (DIW) with ultraviolet
   (UV)-thermal dual curing is made compatible with commercially available
   VE resins thickened by 4 wt\% fumed silica to fabricate
   three-dimensional structures with outstanding mechanical properties. The
   in-situ UV curing during DIW partially solidifies the resin to provide
   the structural shape, and subsequent thermal curing allows for a high
   degree of crosslinking. The printed and dual cured VE nanocomposites
   have a Young's modulus of 3.7 GPa and a tensile strength of
   approximately 80 MPa, which outperforms conventionally molded neat VE
   cured with methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP) by about 10\% and also
   indistinguishable from the tensile properties of molded VE
   nanocomposites with the same composition. The fracture toughness of the
   printed and dual cured VE nanocomposites is also 16\% higher than the
   molded neat VE with MEKP curing due to the superior interfacial bonding
   between DIW infill paths and the additional 4 wt\% fumed silica for
   toughening, and similar to the molded VE nanocomposites with the same
   composition. Along with the outstanding mechanical properties, the
   scalability and resolution of the DIW technique with dual curing is
   demonstrated by printing a 100 mm long wrench and a microscale lattice,
   thus showing the potential of this technique in additive manufacturing
   of high-performance VE structures.},

Abstract = {The capability to manufacture items in space is an exploration enabling
   advancement, and will be crucial for sustainable human exploration as we
   progress beyond Earth orbit. The extrusion based Fused Filament
   Fabrication (FFF) method using thermoplastics represents a robust and
   simple methodology applicable to printing parts for both current and
   future human spaceflight exploration missions. Understanding the
   performance and behaviour of the FFF process under varying gravity loads
   is therefore an important knowledge gap that needs to be addressed in
   order to fully appreciate the characteristics of space manufactured
   elements. At present, it is not well understood how gravity can
   influence the characteristics of such elements fabricated in variable
   gravity environments. In this study, we detail an experiment conducted
   on a parabolic flight campaign (PFC) wherein we produced a number of FFF
   polylactic acid (PLA) polymer test articles and compared them to
   terrestrially fabricated articles. We report on the methodology and the
   operational parameters used, as well as presenting an analysis of the
   samples via optical microscopy and tomography. Compressive, tensile and
   other technical properties are reported herein. A number of explanations
   are presented to explain the variance in specimens relative to
   terrestrial reference samples.},

Title = {Advantages of Additive Manufacturing for Biomedical Applications of
   Polyhydroxyalkanoates},
Journal = {BIOENGINEERING-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In recent years, biopolymers have been attracting the attention of
   researchers and specialists from different fields, including
   biotechnology, material science, engineering, and medicine. The reason
   is the possibility of combining sustainability with scientific and
   technological progress. This is an extremely broad research topic, and a
   distinction has to be made among different classes and types of
   biopolymers. Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) is a particular family of
   polyesters, synthetized by microorganisms under unbalanced growth
   conditions, making them both bio-based and biodegradable polymers with a
   thermoplastic behavior. Recently, PHAs were used more intensively in
   biomedical applications because of their tunable mechanical properties,
   cytocompatibility, adhesion for cells, and controllable
   biodegradability. Similarly, the 3D-printing technologies show
   increasing potential in this particular field of application, due to
   their advantages in tailor-made design, rapid prototyping, and
   manufacturing of complex structures. In this review, first, the
   synthesis and the production of PHAs are described, and different
   production techniques of medical implants are compared. Then, an
   overview is given on the most recent and relevant medical applications
   of PHA for drug delivery, vessel stenting, and tissue engineering. A
   special focus is reserved for the innovations brought by the
   introduction of additive manufacturing in this field, as compared to the
   traditional techniques. All of these advances are expected to have
   important scientific and commercial applications in the near future.},

Title = {Stereolithography based additive manufacturing of high-<i>k</i> polymer
   matrix composites facilitated by thermal plasma processed barium
   titanate microspheres},
Journal = {MATERIALS \& DESIGN},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {192},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Stereolithography (SL) is a promising 3D printing method for the
   fabrication of high dielectric constant polymer matrix composites
   (high-k PMCs) because of its high geometric accuracy and few
   manufacturing defects. However, the presence of ceramic filler destroys
   the fluidity and transparency of high-k PMCs, reducing their 3D
   printability. In this study, we fabricated barium titanate microspheres
   (BT-S) to facilitate the SL-based 3D printing of high-k PMCs using
   radio-frequency thermal plasma spheroidization (RF-TPS) technology.
   Experimental results showed that the prepared BT-S particles have
   spherical shape, smooth surface, large particle size, improved
   mechanical strength and higher purity, which lead to the enhancement in
   the 3D printability of UV curable high-k composites: i) the employment
   of BT-S significantly reduces the apparent viscosity and yield stress;
   and ii) the UV curing depth increased by 542\% maximum. As a result,
   high-k composites were successfully printed using digital light
   processing (DLP) technique under low UV light energy. Moreover, the
   increase of dielectric constant was experimentally verified, which is
   explained by electrostatic energy increment according to finite element
   method (FEM) simulations. This study provided an effective approach
   (i.e. RF-TPS technology) to enhance the 3D printability of high-k PMCs,
   and also promoted the usage of SL-based 3D printing in advanced
   electrical and electronic components (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Effects of Two Melt Extrusion Based Additive Manufacturing Technologies

   PLGA Copolymer},
Journal = {POLYMERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Although bioabsorbable polymers have garnered increasing attention
   because of their potential in tissue engineering applications, to our
   knowledge there are only a few bioabsorbable 3D printed medical devices
   on the market thus far. In this study, we assessed the processability of
   medical grade Poly(lactic-co-glycolic) Acid (PLGA)85:15 via two additive
   manufacturing technologies: Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) and Direct
   Pellet Printing (DPP) to highlight the least destructive technology
   towards PLGA. To quantify PLGA degradation, its molecular weight (gel
   permeation chromatography (GPC)) as well as its thermal properties
   (differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)) were evaluated at each
   processing step, including sterilization with conventional methods
   (ethylene oxide, gamma, and beta irradiation). Results show that 3D
   printing of PLGA on a DPP printer significantly decreased the
   number-average molecular weight (M-n) to the greatest extent (26\% M-n
   loss, p < 0.0001) as it applies a longer residence time and higher shear
   stress compared to classic FFF (19\% M-n loss, p < 0.0001). Among all
   sterilization methods tested, ethylene oxide seems to be the most
   appropriate, as it leads to no significant changes in PLGA properties.
   After sterilization, all samples were considered to be non-toxic, as
   cell viability was above 70\% compared to the control, indicating that
   this manufacturing route could be used for the development of
   bioabsorbable medical devices. Based on our observations, we recommend
   using FFF printing and ethylene oxide sterilization to produce PLGA
   medical devices.},

Volume = {137},

Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {In this study, production of metal/polymer composites using polyethylene
   as the matrix with various contents of metal powder was investigated.
   Fused deposition modeling (FDM) process is one of the most popular and
   conventional additive manufacturing methods to produce three-dimensional
   (3D) specimens from computer-aided design data with complex geometry and
   lower prices in comparison with the alternative methods. Given the
   advantages of this process, it seems inevitable for the development of
   new materials. Utilizing semicrystalline plastics impose challenges for
   producing parts due to printing issues such as distortion and warpage.
   In this experimental work, a compounding production line was implemented
   to produce composite filaments with 25, 50, and 75 wt \% of copper
   powder suitable for the FDM process. After dealing with printing issues,
   flexural, electrical conductivity, and bulk density tests were done. The
   micrographs of the specimens were examined via scanning electron
   microscopy to reveal the distribution of the copper particles. It is
   believed that the metal/polymer filament could be used to print new 3D
   parts. The material could be utilized in electromagnetic structures for
   some specific applications, such as shielding, with new properties.
   Also, by solving printing problems for a semicrystalline polymer, it can
   be encouraging to examine printing process for other rarely used
   thermoplastics. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci.

Abstract = {Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is one of the most widely used
   thermoplastic additive manufacturing techniques that have great
   potential for numerous applications. However, for more advanced additive
   manufacturing with unusual environments, such as in-space manufacturing,
   conventional FFF is limited by the lack of gravity and inconsistent
   nozzle standoff distance. Varying nozzle standoff distances in the FFF
   process typically result in problems with the adhesion of extruded
   material as well as dimensional and geometrical errors in the extruded
   material, which leads to a long setup time and a high failure rate.
   Conventional FFF typically needs continuous monitoring or human
   intervention to ensure successful printing. This paper innovated an
   electric field-assisted FFF (E-FFF) process for robust fabricating parts
   in unconventional printing orientations while eliminating the need for
   constant supervision and human intervention to maintain and adjust the
   z-height calibration. The E-FFF system integrates a high-voltage power
   supply with a conventional FFF printer to produce an electrostatic force
   between the nozzle and the build plate. The generated electrostatic
   force is capable of attracting the extruded molten polymer material
   towards the build plate even at larger z-heights of up to 1200 mu m
   under unconventional printing orientations. The effectiveness of the
   E-FFF process was demonstrated by comparing the E-FFF and conventional
   FFF processes. The results affirm the assistance of gravitational force
   on conventional FFF processes in the normal printing orientation. The
   novel E-FFF process with robust printing capabilities in the vertical
   and reverse orientations enables much larger nozzle standoff distances
   than that of the conventional FFF process, which exhibits great
   potential to be used in the micro/zero-gravity environment in the
   future. A two-dimensional finite element simulation model is used to
   understand the effects of applied voltage on the E-FFF process and
   calculate the electric field intensity. The simulation results showed
   that the electric field intensity of E = 1.27x106 V/m is sufficient for
   successful printing in all demonstrated printing orientations. (c) 2023

Title = {Review of Powder Bed Fusion Additive Manufacturing for Metals},
Journal = {METALS},
Year = {2021},

Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) as a disruptive technology has received much
   attention in recent years. In practice, however, much effort is focused
   on the AM of polymers. It is comparatively more expensive and more
   challenging to additively manufacture metallic parts due to their high
   temperature, the cost of producing powders, and capital outlays for
   metal additive manufacturing equipment. The main technology currently
   used by numerous companies in the aerospace and biomedical sectors to
   fabricate metallic parts is powder bed technology, in which either
   electron or laser beams are used to melt and fuse the powder particles
   line by line to make a three-dimensional part. Since this technology is
   new and also sought by manufacturers, many scientific questions have
   arisen that need to be answered. This manuscript gives an introduction
   to the technology and common materials and applications. Furthermore,
   the microstructure and quality of parts made using powder bed technology
   for several materials that are commonly fabricated using this technology
   are reviewed and the effects of several process parameters investigated
   in the literature are examined. New advances in fabricating highly
   conductive metals such as copper and aluminum are discussed and
   potential for future improvements is explored.},

   print speed and print temperature can make a great contribution to
   printable overhang angle size. In this study, effects of these
   parameters on printable overhang angle size are studied theoretically
   and experimentally. First, theoretical analysis of printable overhang is
   conducted. Then experiments of overhangs with 20 degrees, 30 degrees, 40
   degrees and 50 degrees are carried out with regard to different
   parameters on an FDM printer. According to the results, the printable
   threshold overhang angle varies substantially with printing conditions.
   The findings of this paper can then be applied for setting a lower
   threshold overhang angle for reducing support waste in the future. The
   findings can also provide some reference for future research in
   high-precision printing by adjusting relevant print parameters.},

Title = {Optimizing fused deposition modelling parameters based on the design for
   additive manufacturing to enhance product sustainability},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {145},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Nowadays, designers and engineers rely on specific manufacturing
   guidelines to bring quality products to market with minimum time and
   error. Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) is one of these guides
   adapted to Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies used to increase the
   operational performance of components, mini-mise material waste and
   provide design flexibility. DfAM optimises three-dimensional (3D)
   printing parameters to maximise the potential of AM technologies. DfAM
   improves ecological performance and provides many ad-vantages for the
   transition to a circular economy by providing resource efficiency and
   enabling the production of parts with reduced weight without changing
   their mechanical strength. The aim of this study is to investigate the
   impact of the infill density, infill pattern and layer thickness on the
   printing time, weight, Young's modulus, compressive stress, surface
   roughness, tensile strength, CO2 emissions and amount of material used
   for the samples printed using Poly-lactic acid (PLA) in the Fused
   Deposition Modelling (FDM) method. PLA has been chosen because it is a
   natural and recyclable polymer derived entirely from plant sources. In
   the printing process, samples with different mechanical properties have
   been obtained by changing the infill density (25\%, 50\% and 75\%), the
   infill pattern (gyroid, triangle and grid) and the layer thickness (100,
   150 and 200 mu m) parameters. The Design of Experiment (DoE) method is
   provided to find optimal combinations of the selected parameters.
   Ac-cording to the results of the study, the effect of the layer
   thickness differs on each output. While the infill density is 75\%, grid
   and triangle structures generally give the best results among the infill
   patterns; infill density of 25\% varies according to the infill pattern.
   The gyroid and triangle patterns give optimum results for less layer
   thickness (e.g. 100 mu m), while the grid should be preferred for higher
   layer thickness (e.g. 200 mu m).},

Title = {Numerical study for the improvement of bead spreading architecture with
   modified nozzle geometries in additive manufacturing of polymers},
Journal = {RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Number = {3},
Pages = {518-529},
Month = {MAR 29},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This paper aims to develop a numerical model of bead spreading
   architecture of a viscous polymer in fused filament fabrication (FFF)
   process with different nozzle geometry. This paper also focuses on the
   manufacturing feasibility of the nozzles and 3D printing of the molten
   beads using the developed nozzles.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The flow of a highly viscous polymer from a nozzle, the melt expansion
   in free space and the deposition of the melt on a moving platform are
   captured using the FLUENT volume of fluid (VOF) method based
   computational fluid dynamics code. The free surface motion of the
   material is captured in VOF, which is governed by the hydrodynamics of
   the two-phase flow. The phases involved in the numerical model are
   liquid polymer and air. A laminar, non-Newtonian and non-isothermal flow
   is assumed. Under such assumptions, the spreading characteristic of the
   polymer is simulated with different nozzle-exit geometries. The
   governing equations are solved on a regular stationary grid following a
   transient algorithm, where the boundary between the polymer and the air
   is tracked by piecewise linear interface construction (PLIC) to
   reconstruct the free surface. The prototype nozzles were also
   manufactured, and the deposition of the molten beads on a flatbed was
   performed using a commercial 3D printer. The deposited bead
   cross-sections were examined through optical microscopic examination,
   and the cross-sectional profiles were compared with those obtained in
   the numerical simulations.
   Findings
   The numerical model successfully predicted the spreading characteristics
   and the cross-sectional shape of the extruded bead. The cross-sectional
   shape of the bead varied from elliptical (with circular nozzle) to
   trapezoidal (with square and star nozzles) where the top and bottom
   surfaces are significantly flattened (which is desirable to reduce the
   void spaces in the cross-section). The numerical model yielded a good
   approximation of the bead cross-section, capturing most of the geometric
   features of the bead with a reasonable qualitative agreement compared to
   the experiment. The quantitative comparison of the cross-sectional
   profiles against experimental observation also indicated a favorable
   agreement. The significant improvement observed in the bead
   cross-section with the square and star nozzles is the flattening of the
   surfaces.
   Originality/value
   The developed numerical algorithm attempts to address the fundamental
   challenge of voids and bonding in the FFF process. It presents a new
   approach to increase the inter-bead bonding and reduce the inter-bead
   voids in 3D printing of polymers by modifying the bead cross-sectional
   shape through the modification of nozzle exit-geometry. The change in
   bead cross-sectional shape from elliptical (circular) to trapezoidal
   (square and star) cross-section is supposed to increase the contact
   surface area and inter-bead bonding while in contact with adjacent
   beads.},

   Glass},
Journal = {ADVANCED SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In recent years, additive manufacturing (AM) of glass has attracted
   great interest in academia and industry, yet it is still mostly limited
   to liquid nanocomposite-based approaches for stereolithography,
   two-photon polymerization, or direct ink writing. Melt-extrusion-based
   processes, such as fused deposition modeling (FDM), which will allow
   facile manufacturing of large thin-walled components or simple
   multimaterial printing processes, are so far inaccessible for AM of
   transparent fused silica glass. Here, melt-extrusion-based AM of
   transparent fused silica is introduced by FDM and fused feedstock
   deposition (FFD) using thermoplastic silica nanocomposites that are
   converted to transparent glass using debinding and sintering. This will
   enable printing of previously inaccessible glass structures like
   high-aspect-ratio (>480) vessels with wall thicknesses down to 250 mu m,
   delicate parts including overhanging features using polymer support
   structures, as well as dual extrusion for multicolored glasses.},

Abstract = {Flexible electrochemical sensors based on electroactive materials have
   emerged as powerful analytical tools for biomedical applications
   requiring bioanalytes detection. Within this context, 3D printing is a
   remarkable technology for developing electrochemical devices, due to no
   design constraints, waste minimization, and batch manufacturing with
   high reproducibility. However, the fabrication of 3D printed electrodes
   is still limited by the in-house fabrication of conductive filaments,
   which requires the mixture of the electroactive material with melted of
   thermoplastic polymer (e.g., polylactic acid, PLA). Herein, a simple
   approach is presented for preparing electrochemical dopamine (DA)
   biosensors. Specifically, the surface of 3D-printed PLA specimens, which
   exhibit an elastic modulus and a tensile strength of 3.7 +/- 0.3 GPa and
   47 +/- 1 MPa, respectively, is activated applying a 0.5 m NaOH solution
   for 30 min and, subsequently, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) is
   polymerized in situ using aqueous solvent. The detection of DA with the
   produced sensors has been demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry,
   differential pulse voltammetry, and chronoamperometry. In summary, the
   obtained results reflect that low-cost electrochemical sensors, which
   are widely used in medicine and biotechnology, can be rapidly fabricated
   using the proposed approach that, although based on additive
   manufacturing, does not require the preparation of conductive filaments.},
